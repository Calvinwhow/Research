Limb praxis was normal and eye\nmovements were intact.  Deep tendon reflexes\nwere weak and no pyramidal signs were\nelicited.  Routine blood tests disclosed mild\nnormocytic anaemia and chronic renal fail-\nure,  with no change in her haemodynamic\nstatus.  Infective and inflammatory screens\nwere negative.

Here,  we report the case\nof a patient who developed severe antero-\ngrade amnesia and minimal retrograde\namnesia after a focal haemorrhage in the\nhippocampal body. \n\nA 72-year-old right-handed man was\nadmitted to the International Medical\nCenter of Japan,  Tokyo,  Japan,  in May 1999\nbecause of acute memory impairment.  A few\ndays before admission,  he started forgetting\nwhat he had done and said several minutes\nearlier,  and he could no longer name nearby\nobjects.  On admission,  he was disoriented as\nto the year,  month and day,  and could not\nrecall the names of objects that he had been\ntold to remember a few minutes earlier.  His\nsymptoms continued and were persistent\nl month later.  MRI Tl-weighted images\n\nPostscript\n\n1 month after onset showed a haemorrhage\nin the left hippocampal body and in part of\nthe hippocampal tail.  The lesion included\nCAI,  CA2 and CA3,  the dentate gyrus and\nsubiculum  (fig 1) ,  and extended subcortically\nin the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\nA neuropsychological evaluation was car-\nried out from 34 to 40 days after onset.  The\nWechsler Memory  Scale-Revised score\nshowed that verbal and delayed memory\nindices were markedly low,  whereas the\nvisual memory index was relatively preserved\n (attention and concentration 79,  verbal\nmemory 61,  visual memory 79,  general\nmemory 65 and delayed recall 55) .  A com-\nparison of the delayed test raw score total  (II) \nwith the first test raw score total  (1)  implied\nthat both encoding and_ retrieval were\nimpaired for verbal memory  (II/I 0/6,  full\nscore 58/58) ,  whereas retrieval was mainly\nimpaired for visual memory  (II/I 6/33,  full\nscore 47/47) .  The Benton Visual Retention\nTest score showed that both immediate figure\nreproduction  (7/10)  and reproduction after a\n15s delay  (3/10)  were impaired.  Delayed\nreproduction was also poor in the Rey-\nOsterreith Complex Figure Test  (copying 36/\n36,  30 min delay 6/36) .  Conversely,  scores for\nthe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \nRevised were normal  (verbal intelligence\nquotient  (IQ)  105,  performance IQ 121 and\nfull-scale IQ 114) .  Subtest scores for digit\nspan  (9/19;  forward 4 and backward 4)  and\narithmetic  (6/19) ,  however,  were relatively\nlow.  Digit span forward was also 4 when\npresented visually on a personal computer.\nterm memory or working memory. \n\nRemote memory was assessed with an\nautobiographical memory interview and with\nthe specific questions as described below.  The\npatient could recall autobiographical episodes\nwell,  but could not remember public events\n2 years before onset.  For example,  he remem-\nbered the British royal wedding of Princess\nDiana and Prince Charles in 1985,  but did not\nremember Diana s death in August 1997. \nFurthermore,  he remembered the Nagano\nWinter Olympics in February 1998,  the\nKobe earthquake in January 1995 and the\nTokyo subway sarin gas attack in March\n1995.  To determine whether there was a\ntemporal gradient in his past memory loss, \nwe gave the patient an 80-question multiple-\nchoice questionnaire on public events during\nthe four decades from 1950 to 1989,  divided\ninto four sections with 20 questions for every\n10 years.  He showed a slight temporal\ngradient in these sections,  but all these scores\nwere above the normal mean  (percentage\ncorrect  (normal mean for +70-year-olds, \n\nD) *:  1950s,  95  (53. 7,  5. 45) ;  1960s,  85  (55. 3, \n4. 83) ;  1970s,  75  (58. 5,  5. 05) ;  1980s,  70  (66. 8, \n4. 94) ) . \n\nThe patient profile was rated as follows:   (1) \nsevere anterograde amnesia that affected\nverbal memory more than visual memory; \n (2)  minimal retrograde amnesia for the\noccurrence of public events over the 2 years\nbefore onset,  with temporally graded event\nmemory loss over the preceding 20 years;  and\n (3)  impaired short-term memory. \n\nThis patient showed severe encoding and\nretrieval deficits in verbal memory.  This can\noccur because of a unilateral left hippocampal\nlesion.  A comparison of the reported cases\nshows that bilateral lesions of the hippocam-\npus or medial temporal lobe can cause\nmoderate to severe anterograde amnesia.  \nExamination of our patient suggested that\ndamage to the unilateral  (left)  hippocampal\nPostscript\n\n1197\n\nMRIT1  weighted axial  (A, B)  and coronal  (C-E)  images 1 month after onset showed a high-intensity area,  suggesting a haemorrhage in the\n\nfigyre 1\nle#t hippocampus.  The\n\nlesion included cornus ammonis 1-3,  dentate pris and subiculum,  and extended subcortically in the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\nThe anterior part of the hippocampus that is,  amygdala,  entorhinal cortex and hippocampal head appears intact. \n\nbody  (CA1-3,  dentate gyrus)  and subiculum\nwas enough to result in severe anterograde\namnesia.  As no case report has described\ncircumscribed damage to the amygdala, \nhippocampal head and entorhinal cortex,  it\nis yet to be clarified whether these anterior\nlesions alone can cause severe anterograde\namnesia. \n\nRetrograde amnesia was minimal in our\npatient,  although a detailed evaluation of his\npast memory showed a slight temporal\ngradient in the knowledge of events over\nthe preceding 20 years.  Studies on patients\nwith reported amnesia with hippocampal\nlesions suggested that severe retrograde\namnesia was caused by extensive damage to\nthe hippocampal formation    or to additional\ntemporal lobe structures.  That our patient\nshowed minimal retrograde amnesia with\nsparing of the amygdala and hippocampal\nhead is consistent with this view. \n\nAnother possibility is that the anterior part\nof the hippocampus  (hippocampal head and\n\nentorhinal cortex)  is more associated with\nextensive retrograde amnesia than the hip-\npocampal body.  As the entorhinal cortex\nprojects to the medial thalamus,  whereas\nthe subiculum  (posterior hippocampus lesion\nin our patient)  has connections to the\nanterior thalamic nuclei,   it is rational to\ncompare associated amnesic symptoms\nbetween the two lesions.  Patients with a\nlesion limited to the anterior hippocampus\nwould thus tend to show the involvement of\nthis area in retrograde memory. \n\nOur patient also showed a reduced digit\nspan,  which indicated auditory and visual \nverbal short-term memory impairment.  Few\ncase reports have referred to digit span in\ntemporal lobe amnesia.  One possible expla-\nnation for the reduced digit span is that the\nhaemorrhage affected extensive areas in the\ntemporal and parietal lobes.\nobserved | year earlier.
