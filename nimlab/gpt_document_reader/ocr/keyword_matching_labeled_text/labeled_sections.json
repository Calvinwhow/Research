Here,  we identify the\nstructural and functional connectivity profile of effective DBS to the subthalamic nucleus  (STN) \nand test its ability to predict outcome in an independent cohort. \n\nMethods  A training dataset of 51 PD patients with STN DBS was combined with publicly\navailable human connectome data  (diffusion tractography and resting state functional connectivity) \nto identify connections reliably associated with clinical improvement  (motor score of the Unified\nParkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]) .  This connectivity profile was then used to predict\noutcome in an independent cohort of 44 patients from a different center. \n\nResults  In the training dataset,  connectivity between the DBS electrode and a distributed\nnetwork of brain regions correlated with clinical response including structural connectivity to\nsupplementary motor area and functional anticorrelation to primary motor cortex  (p<0. 001) .  This\nsame connectivity profile predicted response in an independent patient cohort  (p<0. 01) .  Structural\nand functional connectivity were independent predictors of clinical improvement  (p<0. 001)  and\nestimated response in individual patients with an average error of 15% UPDRS improvement. \nResults were similar using connectome data from normal subjects or a connectome age,  sex,  and\ndisease matched to our DBS patients. \n\nInterpretation  Effective STN DBS for PD is associated with a specific connectivity profile that\ncan predict clinical outcome across independent cohorts.  This prediction does not require\nspecialized imaging in PD patients themselves. \n\nDeep brain stimulation  (DBS)  is a well-established treatment for Parkinson disease  (PD) , \nyielding improvements in motor symptoms and quality of life. ! The most common DBS\ntarget is the subthalamic nucleus  (STN) ,  identified based on stereotactic coordinates and\npreoperative magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) .  However,  the therapeutic benefit of DBS\nmay depend on modulation of remote brain regions connected to the stimulation site. 2~+\nThese remote effects of DBS have been measured with both electrophysiology>  and brain\n\n3. 7-10 Furthermore,  they can correlate with clinical response. !! As such, \n\nimaging.  - \nconnectivity of the stimulation site to a network of other brain regions may be an important\nmediator of DBS response.  If so,  one could potentially predict response based on\nconnectivity with the stimulation site and even optimize the DBS target based on\n\nconnectivity. \n\nPage 2\n\nMotivated by these findings,  researchers have worked to determine which connections with\nthe DBS site are most important.  For example,  the hyperdirect pathway connecting STN to\ncortex is thought to play a key role. 8-!2-!4 However,  identifying connectivity noninvasively\nin humans is not straightforward.  Two MRI-based connectivity measures appear promising. \nDiffusion tractography,  a noninvasive metric of anatomical connectivity,  can identify white\n\nmatter tracts near the DBS electrode.  9: !0-!5-!7 Functional connectivity,  a measure of the\ncorrelation in spontaneous activity,  can link DBS sites to cortical regions including targets of\nnoninvasive brain stimulation. 2-!8 Despite these efforts,  the connectivity profile of clinically\neffective STN stimulation for PD remains unclear. \n\nAnn Neurol.

        "Subjects and Methods": "Patient Cohorts and Imaging\n\nNinety-five DBS patients from 2 different centers were retrospectively included in this study\n (mean age = 60. 2 + 8. 0 years,  29 women) .  The first  training  dataset was from Charit \nUniversitatsmedizin,  Berlin,  whereas the second  test  dataset was from Wiirzburg\nUniversity Hospital  (Table) .  The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki and was approved by the internal review board of Charit Universitatsmedizin or\nWiirzburg University Hospital  (see below) . \n\nAll patients  (both datasets)  underwent DBS surgery for PD and received 2 quadripolar DBS\nelectrodes  (model 3389;  Medtronic,  Minneapolis,  MN) .  All patients received preoperative\nMRI and neuropsychological testing to exclude structural or severe psychiatric\ncomorbidities.  During surgery,  microelectrode recordings were performed to verify lead\nplacement.  Clinical variables,  including age,  sex,  disease duration before surgery,  L-dopa\nresponse  (percentage improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]-III\nON vs OFF)  before surgery and L-dopa equivalent dose  (LEDD)  at baseline,  were recorded\nand tested for predictive value of clinical outcome in a univariate analysis. \n\nThe Berlin  (training)  dataset consisted of 4 subcohorts,  enrolled at different times and for\ndifferent studies.  These subcohorts were intentionally heterogenous in clinical presentation\nand DBS effects to ensure that results from this training dataset would be as generalizable as\npossible.  One subcohort consisted of early stage PD patients  (B, ) ,  1 subcohort was\nretrospectively gathered from medical records with only clinical assessment of UPDRS\nresponse  (82) ,  | subcohort consisted of a typical,  average-aged study population of patients\nstimulated to the STN  (83) ,  and 1 subcohort had DBS targeting the nearby caudal zona\nincerta rather than the STN itself  (B, ) .  Detailed clinical results of this final cohort will be\nreported elsewhere.  For all patients in the Berlin cohort,  DBS response was measured as\npercentage change in UPDRS motor score ON versus OFF DBS assessed | to 2 years\npostoperatively. \n\nThe Wiirzburg  (test)  dataset consisted of a single clinical cohort.  DBS response was\nmeasured as percentage change in UPDRS motor score comparing postoperative ON DBS to\npreoperative baseline.  Note that the DBS outcome measure was different in the Wiirzburg\nversus Berlin cohorts,  which was intentional to ensure generalizability of our results.  All\nUPDRS-III scores  (both datasets)  were recorded after withdrawal from dopaminergic\nmedication for > 12 hours. \n\nAnn Neurol.

Briefly,  postoperative images were linearly coregistered to preoperative\nMRI using SPM12  (http: //www. fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/spm/software/spm 1 2/;  postoperative MRI) \nor BRAINSFit software  (https: //www. nitre. org/projects/multimodereg/;  postoperative\ncomputed tomography) .  Coregistrations were manually controlled for each patient and\nrefined if needed. \n\nImages were then normalized into ICBM 2009b NLIN asymmetric space using the SyN\napproach implemented in advanced normalization tools  (http: //stnava. github. io/ANTs/) \nbased on the preoperative MRI.  DBS electrode contacts were localized within MNI space\nusing Lead-DBS software  (www. lead-dbs. org; 26) , \n\nVolume of Tissue Activated Estimation\n\nVolume of tissue activated  (VTA)  estimation largely followed the concepts described in\nMcIntyre et al?7 and Astr m et al but processes were reimplemented using a novel open-\nsource pipeline explained below.  To construct a volume conductor model of the DBS\nelectrode and surrounding tissue,  a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated based on the\nsurface meshes of DBS electrodes and subcortical nuclei using the Iso2Mesh toolbox  (http: //\niso2mesh. sourceforge. net/)  as included within Lead-DBS.  Regions filled with neither\nconducting/insulating electrode material nor gray matter were assigned to white matter. \nSubcortical gray matter nuclei were defined by the DISTAL atlas. 29 Conductivities of 0. 33\nand 0. 14S/m were assigned to gray and white matter,  respectively.   For the platinum/\niridium contacts and insulated parts of the electrodes,  values of 108S/m and 10~! S/m were\nused,  respectively.  Based on the volume conductor model,  the potential distribution resulting\nfrom DBS was simulated using the integration of the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline into Lead-\nDBS  (https: //www. mrt. uni-jena. de/simbio/index . php/;  http: //fieldtriptoolbox. org) .  The\nvoltage applied to the active electrode contacts was introduced as a boundary condition.  In\ncase of monopolar stimulation,  the surface of the volume mesh served as the anode. \nSubsequently,  the gradient of the potential distribution was calculated by derivation of the\nfinite element method  (FEM)  solution.  Due to the first order FEM approach that was used, \nthe resulting gradient is piecewise continuous.  The gradient was thresholded for magnitudes\nabove a commonly used value of 0. 2V/mm?8: 3! to define the extent and shape of the volume\nof tissue activated. \n\nConnectivity Estimation\n\nFunctional and structural connectivity estimates between each VTA and all other brain\nvoxels were computed using 2 connectomes:  a large normative connectome from healthy\nsubjects  (n = 1, 030)  and a smaller connectome that was age,  sex,  and disease matched to our\nDBS patients  (n = 90) . \n\nNORMATIVE CONNECTOME  Resting state functional connectivity data was obtained\non 1, 000 healthy subjects using a 3T Siemens  (Erlangen,  Germany)  MRI,  part of the Brain\nGenomics Superstruct Project  (https: //dataverse. harvard. edu/dataverse/GSP) . >* Processing\nincluded global signal regression and spatial smoothing at 6mm full width at half maximum\n\nAnn Neurol.

For structural connectivity,  a group connectome was computed\nbased on multishell diffusion-weighted  (DSI Studio,  http: //dsi-studio. labsolver. org)  and T2-\nweighted imaging data from 32 subjects of the Human Connectome Project at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital  (https: //ida. loni. usc. edu/login. jsp) .  These data were acquired on a specially\ndesigned MRI scanner with more powerful gradients than available on conventional MRI\nscanners.  Whole brain tractography fiber sets were calculated using a generalized q-\nsampling imaging algorithm as implemented in DSI Studio.  Sampling was performed within\na white matter mask that was defined using the unified segmentation approach on T2-\nweighted structural acquisitions and that was coregistered to the bg volume using SPM12.  In\neach subject,  200, 000 fibers were sampled.  Fiber tracts were then transformed into MNI\nspace as previously described. 24. 33-35\n\nPD CONNECTOME MRI data from 90 patients were obtained from the Parkinson s\nProgression Markers Initiative  (PPMI)  database  (mean age = 61. 38 + 10. 42 standard\ndeviation,  28 female) .  This dataset was also age and sex matched to our full cohort  (69% vs\n68% women,  difference in mean age = | year) .  Detailed scanning parameters can be found\non the project website  (www. ppmi-info. orgz) .  All 90 patients had diffusion-weighted scans, \nbut only 74 had resting-state functional MRI scans.  Processing of both functional and\nstructural data was performed identical as in healthy subjects. \n\nConnectivity between each VTA and voxels in the rest of the brain was estimated using the\nabove connectome datasets.  For functional connectivity,  time series were sampled from\nvoxels inside each VTA in each of the 1, 000  (healthy) /74  (parkinsonian connectome) \nsubjects and correlated with time series from every other voxel in the brain.  These functional\nconnectivity estimates were then averaged across subjects within the connectome dataset. \nFor structural connectivity,  fibers traversing through the VTA were selected from the group\nconnectome and projected to the volumetric space of the brain in 2mm isotropic resolution, \ndenoting the number of fibers  (connected to the VTA)  that traversed through each voxel. \n\nGenerating Models of Beneficial Connectivity\n\nA map of gray matter voxels was defined by thresholding the tissue probability map\nsupplied with SPM12  (p> 0. 2,  2x2x2mm MNI-152 space) .  The  (structural and functional) \nconnectivity from VTAs to each voxel in this volume was calculated for each patient. \nFunctional connectivity strength was expressed as averaged R values across the 1, 000\nsubjects.  Structural connectivity strength was expressed as numbers of fiber tracts between\nVTA and cortical voxels.  Functional connectivity maps were Fisher z-transformed before\nperforming spatial correlations.  Likewise,  structural connectivity profiles were transformed\ninto a Gaussian distribution following the approach of van Albada.   Neither transformation\n (Fisher z or van Albada approach)  altered main results reported in this article.  Figure 1\nsummarizes methods to identify DBS connectivity. \n\nWe used our training dataset to evaluate different options for identifying connections\npredictive of clinical outcome.  First,  the connectivity map of each VTA was weighted by\nclinical improvement  (weighted average maps) .  Second,  voxels whose VTA connectivity\nwas correlated with clinical outcome were identified  (R maps) .  Third,  we created maps of\n\nAnn Neurol.

Finally,  we computed maps using either our\nnormative connectome or our PD connectome. \n\nTo determine which option was best for predicting clinical outcome,  we used our training\ndataset  (B; _4)  and a leave-one-cohort out design.  For example,  we used cohorts B;  B;  to\ngenerate each of the above maps,  then used the map to predict clinical outcome in cohort By. \nClinical outcome estimates were based on the similarity between the  ideal  connectivity\nprofile and the connectivity profile from each individual patient  (measured using a Fisher z-\ntransformed spatial correlation coefficient) .  This was done independently for structural and\nfunctional connectivity.  The best model for predicting results across cohorts in the Berlin\ndataset  (B; _4)  was then applied to the independent Wiirzburg test data  ( W) . \n\nFinally,  we used the combined dataset  (B; _4+ W;  n= 95) ,  and a general linear model\n (GLM)  combining both structural and functional connectivity profiles to test  (1)  whether the\n2 types of connectivity are independent predictors for clinical outcome and  (2)  how much of\nthe outcome variance can be explained by the 2 connectivity measures combined.  An initial\nGLM was computed based on connectivity estimates alone,  whereas a second GLM\nincluded relevant baseline clinical variables. \n\nTo test how robustly outcome of individual patients could be predicted,  the same GLMs\nwere solved in a leave-one-patient-out fashion.  In other words,  data from 94 patients were\nused to predict the 95th patient and predicted improvement was compared to the actual\nimprovement.  The average prediction error was reported and 3 index patients were selected\nto show example results. \n\nOur DBS cohort included 95 patients across 2 independent datasets  (30 female,  mean age =\n60. 2 + 8. 0 years) ,  68 akinetic-rigid,  19 mixed,  and 8 tremor-dominant cases  (see Table) . \nAverage disease duration was 11. 4 + 4. 3 years,  baseline UPDRS score was 43. 7 + 13. 4,  L-\ndopa response was 57. 6 + 18. 2%,  and UPDRS improvement with DBS was 47. 2 + 22. 4%. \nReduction in LEDD comparing baseline to 12 months post-DBS was 58. 3 %  (1, 250. 0\n\n+ 595. 5 before vs 530. 7 + 389. 2 after surgery) .  DBS response was heterogeneous across the\nBerlin subcohorts,  which was intentional to ensure results would be robust to cohort\ndifferences. \n\nBaseline UPDRS score was the only clinical variable predictive of DBS response in both the\nBerlin  (R = 0. 33,  p<0. 02)  and Wiirzburg  (R = 0. 35,  p<0. 02)  cohorts,  with higher baseline\nscores predicting greater percentage improvement.  Age at surgery  (R =  0. 42,  p= 0. 002) \nand female sex  (t= 2. 5,  p= 0. 01)  were predictive in the Berlin but not the Wiirzburg cohort\n (p> 0. 8 for both variables) .  Disease duration  (p> 0. 4) ,  baseline L-dopa response  (p> 0. 15) , \nand baseline LEDD  (p> 0. 1)  were not predictive of DBS outcome in either cohort. \n\nDBS lead placement was roughly similar across our 2 cohorts  (Fig 2) .  Using patient-specific\nelectrode locations and VTAs within the Berlin cohort  (n = 51) ,  we identified numerous\n\nAnn Neurol.

The\nbetter a patient s DBS connectivity profile matched these maps,  the better their clinical\noutcome.  This held true both on the full Berlin dataset  (B; _4)  and in a leave-one-subcohort\nout fashion  (eg,  using B; _3to estimate response in Bz) .  Several options for computing these\nconnectivity maps were explored within the training dataset  (see Subjects and Methods) . \nThe healthy connectome data and the combined maps  (overlap of the weighted maps and R\nmaps)  explained the greatest variance in the leave-one-subcohort out analysis. \n\nThese connectivity profiles  (combined maps,  normative connectome)  derived using the\nBerlin data were then used to predict clinical outcome in the independent Wiirzburg data\n (Fig 4) .  Both structural connectivity  (R = 0. 45,  p = 0. 002)  and functional connectivity  (R=\n0. 34,  p= 0. 03)  were significant predictors of clinical outcome in this independent dataset\ndespite differences in center,  surgeon,  and timing of clinical assessment. \n\nTopography of connectivity to effective DBS sites  (combined maps)  was highly similar\nwhen computed for the Berlin training dataset  (n = 51) ,  Wiirzburg test dataset  (n = 44) ,  and\nfull dataset  (n = 95;  Fig 5) .  Anticorrelation between DBS electrodes and primary motor\ncortex  (M1) ,  as well as structural connectivity to supplementary motor area  (SMA) ,  superior\nfrontal gyrus,  and cerebellum,  was predictive of beneficial outcome in both datasets alone\nand the combined dataset. \n\nBoth structural  (p<0. 006)  and functional  (p<0. 007)  connectivity were independent predictors\nof clinical outcome.  A combined model incorporating both types of connectivity explained\n26. 2% of the clinical variance in DBS response  (correlation between predicted and true\nimprovements of R= 0. 51 at p<10-8) .  Adding clinical variables to this model  (age,  sex,  and\nUPDRS at baseline)  explained 43. 4% of the variance in DBS response  (R = 0. 66 at\np<107!3) ,  In this final model,  structural connectivity,  functional connectivity,  UPDRS at\nbaseline,  and sex were all significant independent predictors of DBS response  (p<0. 05) . \n\nIn a final analysis,  we explored how well we could predict outcome in individual patients\nbased on connectivity of a patient s DBS electrode.  This was done on the combined\n\n (B7_4+ W)  dataset while leaving out the patient in question.  These predictions on average\ndeviated by 15. 7 + 14. 2% from actual UPDRS-III improvements.  For example,  if a patient\nactually improved by 30%,  our connectivity algorithm might predict an improvement of\n45% or 15%.  Including additional clinical variables  (UPDRS at baseline,  age at surgery,  sex) \nto the analysis added little to the clinical predictions based on connectivity alone  (mean error\n= 15. 1 + 11. 8%) .  Three patients selected to illustrate a good responder with an accurate\nprediction,  a poor responder with an accurate prediction,  and a poor responder with an\ninaccurate prediction are shown in Figure 6. \n\nAlthough our normative connectome performed slightly better than our PD connectome in\nour Berlin leave-one-subcohort out analysis,  there is intuitive appeal to using an age-,  sex-, \nand disease-matched connectome.  We therefore repeated all analyses using this PD\nconnectome and found results were highly similar.  For example,  functional connectivity\nbetween the VTA and M1 was highly correlated across patients using the normative versus\nPD connectome  (R = 0. 97,  p<107 )  and predicted similar variance in DBS response  (R =\n\nAnn Neurol.

Briefly,  postoperative images were linearly coregistered to preoperative\nMRI using SPM12  (http: //www. fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/spm/software/spm 1 2/;  postoperative MRI) \nor BRAINSFit software  (https: //www. nitre. org/projects/multimodereg/;  postoperative\ncomputed tomography) .  Coregistrations were manually controlled for each patient and\nrefined if needed. \n\nImages were then normalized into ICBM 2009b NLIN asymmetric space using the SyN\napproach implemented in advanced normalization tools  (http: //stnava. github. io/ANTs/) \nbased on the preoperative MRI.  DBS electrode contacts were localized within MNI space\nusing Lead-DBS software  (www. lead-dbs. org; 26) , \n\nVolume of Tissue Activated Estimation\n\nVolume of tissue activated  (VTA)  estimation largely followed the concepts described in\nMcIntyre et al?7 and Astr m et al but processes were reimplemented using a novel open-\nsource pipeline explained below.  To construct a volume conductor model of the DBS\nelectrode and surrounding tissue,  a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated based on the\nsurface meshes of DBS electrodes and subcortical nuclei using the Iso2Mesh toolbox  (http: //\niso2mesh. sourceforge. net/)  as included within Lead-DBS.  Regions filled with neither\nconducting/insulating electrode material nor gray matter were assigned to white matter. \nSubcortical gray matter nuclei were defined by the DISTAL atlas. 29 Conductivities of 0. 33\nand 0. 14S/m were assigned to gray and white matter,  respectively.   For the platinum/\niridium contacts and insulated parts of the electrodes,  values of 108S/m and 10~! S/m were\nused,  respectively.  Based on the volume conductor model,  the potential distribution resulting\nfrom DBS was simulated using the integration of the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline into Lead-\nDBS  (https: //www. mrt. uni-jena. de/simbio/index . php/;  http: //fieldtriptoolbox. org) .  The\nvoltage applied to the active electrode contacts was introduced as a boundary condition.  In\ncase of monopolar stimulation,  the surface of the volume mesh served as the anode. \nSubsequently,  the gradient of the potential distribution was calculated by derivation of the\nfinite element method  (FEM)  solution.  Due to the first order FEM approach that was used, \nthe resulting gradient is piecewise continuous.  The gradient was thresholded for magnitudes\nabove a commonly used value of 0. 2V/mm?8: 3! to define the extent and shape of the volume\nof tissue activated. \n\nConnectivity Estimation\n\nFunctional and structural connectivity estimates between each VTA and all other brain\nvoxels were computed using 2 connectomes:  a large normative connectome from healthy\nsubjects  (n = 1, 030)  and a smaller connectome that was age,  sex,  and disease matched to our\nDBS patients  (n = 90) . \n\nNORMATIVE CONNECTOME  Resting state functional connectivity data was obtained\non 1, 000 healthy subjects using a 3T Siemens  (Erlangen,  Germany)  MRI,  part of the Brain\nGenomics Superstruct Project  (https: //dataverse. harvard. edu/dataverse/GSP) . >* Processing\nincluded global signal regression and spatial smoothing at 6mm full width at half maximum\n\nAnn Neurol.

For structural connectivity,  a group connectome was computed\nbased on multishell diffusion-weighted  (DSI Studio,  http: //dsi-studio. labsolver. org)  and T2-\nweighted imaging data from 32 subjects of the Human Connectome Project at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital  (https: //ida. loni. usc. edu/login. jsp) .  These data were acquired on a specially\ndesigned MRI scanner with more powerful gradients than available on conventional MRI\nscanners.  Whole brain tractography fiber sets were calculated using a generalized q-\nsampling imaging algorithm as implemented in DSI Studio.  Sampling was performed within\na white matter mask that was defined using the unified segmentation approach on T2-\nweighted structural acquisitions and that was coregistered to the bg volume using SPM12.  In\neach subject,  200, 000 fibers were sampled.  Fiber tracts were then transformed into MNI\nspace as previously described. 24. 33-35\n\nPD CONNECTOME MRI data from 90 patients were obtained from the Parkinson s\nProgression Markers Initiative  (PPMI)  database  (mean age = 61. 38 + 10. 42 standard\ndeviation,  28 female) .  This dataset was also age and sex matched to our full cohort  (69% vs\n68% women,  difference in mean age = | year) .  Detailed scanning parameters can be found\non the project website  (www. ppmi-info. orgz) .  All 90 patients had diffusion-weighted scans, \nbut only 74 had resting-state functional MRI scans.  Processing of both functional and\nstructural data was performed identical as in healthy subjects. \n\nConnectivity between each VTA and voxels in the rest of the brain was estimated using the\nabove connectome datasets.  For functional connectivity,  time series were sampled from\nvoxels inside each VTA in each of the 1, 000  (healthy) /74  (parkinsonian connectome) \nsubjects and correlated with time series from every other voxel in the brain.  These functional\nconnectivity estimates were then averaged across subjects within the connectome dataset. \nFor structural connectivity,  fibers traversing through the VTA were selected from the group\nconnectome and projected to the volumetric space of the brain in 2mm isotropic resolution, \ndenoting the number of fibers  (connected to the VTA)  that traversed through each voxel. \n\nGenerating Models of Beneficial Connectivity\n\nA map of gray matter voxels was defined by thresholding the tissue probability map\nsupplied with SPM12  (p> 0. 2,  2x2x2mm MNI-152 space) .  The  (structural and functional) \nconnectivity from VTAs to each voxel in this volume was calculated for each patient. \nFunctional connectivity strength was expressed as averaged R values across the 1, 000\nsubjects.  Structural connectivity strength was expressed as numbers of fiber tracts between\nVTA and cortical voxels.  Functional connectivity maps were Fisher z-transformed before\nperforming spatial correlations.  Likewise,  structural connectivity profiles were transformed\ninto a Gaussian distribution following the approach of van Albada.   Neither transformation\n\nPage 6\n\nvoxels both connected to the VTA and correlated with clinical outcome  (combined maps) . \nThis third map was computed by masking the weighted average maps by the R maps  (R>0\nfor positive values and R<0 for negative values) .  Finally,  we computed maps using either our\nnormative connectome or our PD connectome. \n\nTo determine which option was best for predicting clinical outcome,  we used our training\ndataset  (B; _4)  and a leave-one-cohort out design.  For example,  we used cohorts B;  B;  to\ngenerate each of the above maps,  then used the map to predict clinical outcome in cohort By. \nClinical outcome estimates were based on the similarity between the  ideal  connectivity\nprofile and the connectivity profile from each individual patient  (measured using a Fisher z-\ntransformed spatial correlation coefficient) .  This was done independently for structural and\ndataset  (B; _4)  was then applied to the independent Wiirzburg test data  ( W) . \n\nFinally,  we used the combined dataset  (B; _4+ W;  n= 95) ,  and a general linear model\n (GLM)  combining both structural and functional connectivity profiles to test  (1)  whether the\n2 types of connectivity are independent predictors for clinical outcome and  (2)  how much of\nthe outcome variance can be explained by the 2 connectivity measures combined.  An initial\nGLM was computed based on connectivity estimates alone,  whereas a second GLM\nincluded relevant baseline clinical variables. \n\nTo test how robustly outcome of individual patients could be predicted,  the same GLMs\nwere solved in a leave-one-patient-out fashion.  In other words,  data from 94 patients were\nused to predict the 95th patient and predicted improvement was compared to the actual\nimprovement.  The average prediction error was reported and 3 index patients were selected\nOur DBS cohort included 95 patients across 2 independent datasets  (30 female,  mean age =\n60. 2 + 8. 0 years) ,  68 akinetic-rigid,  19 mixed,  and 8 tremor-dominant cases  (see Table) . \nAverage disease duration was 11. 4 + 4. 3 years,  baseline UPDRS score was 43. 7 + 13. 4,  L-\ndopa response was 57. 6 + 18. 2%,  and UPDRS improvement with DBS was 47. 2 + 22. 4%. \nReduction in LEDD comparing baseline to 12 months post-DBS was 58. 3 %  (1, 250. 0\n\n+ 595. 5 before vs 530. 7 + 389. 2 after surgery) .  DBS response was heterogeneous across the\ndifferences. \n\nBaseline UPDRS score was the only clinical variable predictive of DBS response in both the\nBerlin  (R = 0. 33,  p<0. 02)  and Wiirzburg  (R = 0. 35,  p<0. 02)  cohorts,  with higher baseline\nscores predicting greater percentage improvement.  Age at surgery  (R =  0. 42,  p= 0. 002) \nand female sex  (t= 2. 5,  p= 0. 01)  were predictive in the Berlin but not the Wiirzburg cohort\n (p> 0. 8 for both variables) .  Disease duration  (p> 0. 4) ,  baseline L-dopa response  (p> 0. 15) , \nand baseline LEDD  (p> 0. 1)  were not predictive of DBS outcome in either cohort. \n\nDBS lead placement was roughly similar across our 2 cohorts  (Fig 2) .

Future\nwork is needed to determine how to best combine the strengths of normative connectomes, \n\npatient-based connectomes,  and connectivity data from individual patients. \n\nOne final difference between the current study and prior work relates to our focus on\nreproducibility across datasets.  We utilized independent cohorts from different DBS centers, \nand intentionally selected heterogeneous cohorts to ensure reproducibility.  Our cohorts were\noperated on by different surgeons,  had different postoperative imaging,  and had DBS\nresponse measured in different ways.  Such heterogeneity could be seen as a limitation,  as it\nsignificant despite this heterogeneity is a major strength and should lead to improved\nreproducibility in other cohorts.  To our knowledge,  this is the first DBS imaging study to test\nMultimodal Confirmation\n\nThe connectivity profiles identified in the current study are consistent with prior work in PD\npatients using various modalities to identify brain regions modulated by STN DBS. !! Brain\nregions anatomically connected and positively correlated with effective STN electrodes in\nthe current study  (eg,  SMA,  anterior cingulate,  medial prefrontal cortex)  have shown\nincreased activity in neuroimaging studies when STN DBS is turned on.   The activation of\nSMA in particular is hypothesized to occur via activation of fibers within the hyperdirect\npathway.  8-!3 Atrophy in SMA and premotor cortex was also a predictor of DBS outcome in\nother frontal areas in DBS response \n\nIn contrast to the SMA,  M1 was negatively correlated with effective STN DBS electrodes in\nthe current study.  Patients with a good response had DBS electrodes that were  (functionally) \nnegatively correlated to M1.  Correspondingly,  if DBS is activated,  M1 has been reported to\nmay predict the sign of metabolic changes induced by DBS.  Other work implicating M1 in\nthe pathophysiology of PD includes abnormal connectivity between STN and M129 and\nmodulation of M1 excitability by STN DBS. * \n\nImplications for Network-Targeted Stimulation\n\nBy showing that connectivity predicts the response of individual PD patients to DBS,  the\nnetworks and not individual brain regions. 2+9-!0. !4-17 As such,  different network nodes may\npotentially be targeted by different stimulation modalities with similar therapeutic benefit. \n\nAnn Neurol.

However,  more advanced VTA\nnot designed to contrast the predictive ability of connectivity with anatomy  (ie, \nelectrode/VTA location*8 ,  No prior study has shown that anatomical location alone can\npredict DBS outcome in an independent cohort,  but that does not mean that anatomy would\nnot have been predictive in our case.  Future work is needed to understand the relative\ncontribution of anatomical location and connectivity to predicting outcome. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe study was supported by the Prof.  Klaus Thiemann Foundation  (A.

To construct a volume conductor model of the DBS\nelectrode and surrounding tissue,  a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated based on the\nsurface meshes of DBS electrodes and subcortical nuclei using the Iso2Mesh toolbox  (http: //\niso2mesh. sourceforge. net/)  as included within Lead-DBS.  Regions filled with neither\nconducting/insulating electrode material nor gray matter were assigned to white matter. \nSubcortical gray matter nuclei were defined by the DISTAL atlas. 29 Conductivities of 0. 33\nand 0. 14S/m were assigned to gray and white matter,  respectively.   For the platinum/\niridium contacts and insulated parts of the electrodes,  values of 108S/m and 10~! S/m were\nused,  respectively.  Based on the volume conductor model,  the potential distribution resulting\nfrom DBS was simulated using the integration of the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline into Lead-\nDBS  (https: //www. mrt. uni-jena. de/simbio/index . php/;  http: //fieldtriptoolbox. org) .  The\nvoltage applied to the active electrode contacts was introduced as a boundary condition.  In\ncase of monopolar stimulation,  the surface of the volume mesh served as the anode. \nSubsequently,  the gradient of the potential distribution was calculated by derivation of the\nfinite element method  (FEM)  solution.  Due to the first order FEM approach that was used, \nthe resulting gradient is piecewise continuous.  The gradient was thresholded for magnitudes\nabove a commonly used value of 0. 2V/mm?8: 3! to define the extent and shape of the volume\nof tissue activated. \n\nConnectivity Estimation\n\nFunctional and structural connectivity estimates between each VTA and all other brain\nvoxels were computed using 2 connectomes:  a large normative connectome from healthy\nsubjects  (n = 1, 030)  and a smaller connectome that was age,  sex,  and disease matched to our\nDBS patients  (n = 90) . \n\nNORMATIVE CONNECTOME  Resting state functional connectivity data was obtained\non 1, 000 healthy subjects using a 3T Siemens  (Erlangen,  Germany)  MRI,  part of the Brain\nGenomics Superstruct Project  (https: //dataverse. harvard. edu/dataverse/GSP) . >* Processing\nincluded global signal regression and spatial smoothing at 6mm full width at half maximum\n\nAnn Neurol.

For structural connectivity,  a group connectome was computed\nbased on multishell diffusion-weighted  (DSI Studio,  http: //dsi-studio. labsolver. org)  and T2-\nweighted imaging data from 32 subjects of the Human Connectome Project at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital  (https: //ida. loni. usc. edu/login. jsp) .  These data were acquired on a specially\ndesigned MRI scanner with more powerful gradients than available on conventional MRI\nscanners.  Whole brain tractography fiber sets were calculated using a generalized q-\nsampling imaging algorithm as implemented in DSI Studio.  Sampling was performed within\na white matter mask that was defined using the unified segmentation approach on T2-\nweighted structural acquisitions and that was coregistered to the bg volume using SPM12.  In\neach subject,  200, 000 fibers were sampled.  Fiber tracts were then transformed into MNI\nspace as previously described. 24. 33-35\n\nPD CONNECTOME MRI data from 90 patients were obtained from the Parkinson s\nProgression Markers Initiative  (PPMI)  database  (mean age = 61. 38 + 10. 42 standard\ndeviation,  28 female) .  This dataset was also age and sex matched to our full cohort  (69% vs\n68% women,  difference in mean age = | year) .  Detailed scanning parameters can be found\non the project website  (www. ppmi-info. orgz) .  All 90 patients had diffusion-weighted scans, \nbut only 74 had resting-state functional MRI scans.  Processing of both functional and\nstructural data was performed identical as in healthy subjects. \n\nConnectivity between each VTA and voxels in the rest of the brain was estimated using the\nabove connectome datasets.  For functional connectivity,  time series were sampled from\nvoxels inside each VTA in each of the 1, 000  (healthy) /74  (parkinsonian connectome) \nsubjects and correlated with time series from every other voxel in the brain.  These functional\nconnectivity estimates were then averaged across subjects within the connectome dataset. \nFor structural connectivity,  fibers traversing through the VTA were selected from the group\nconnectome and projected to the volumetric space of the brain in 2mm isotropic resolution, \ndenoting the number of fibers  (connected to the VTA)  that traversed through each voxel. \n\nGenerating Models of Beneficial Connectivity\n\nA map of gray matter voxels was defined by thresholding the tissue probability map\nsupplied with SPM12  (p> 0. 2,  2x2x2mm MNI-152 space) .  The  (structural and functional) \nconnectivity from VTAs to each voxel in this volume was calculated for each patient. \nFunctional connectivity strength was expressed as averaged R values across the 1, 000\nsubjects.  Structural connectivity strength was expressed as numbers of fiber tracts between\nVTA and cortical voxels.  Functional connectivity maps were Fisher z-transformed before\nperforming spatial correlations.  Likewise,  structural connectivity profiles were transformed\ninto a Gaussian distribution following the approach of van Albada.   Neither transformation\n\nPage 6\n\nvoxels both connected to the VTA and correlated with clinical outcome  (combined maps) . \nThis third map was computed by masking the weighted average maps by the R maps  (R>0\nfor positive values and R<0 for negative values) .  Finally,  we computed maps using either our\nnormative connectome or our PD connectome. \n\nTo determine which option was best for predicting clinical outcome,  we used our training\ndataset  (B; _4)  and a leave-one-cohort out design.  For example,  we used cohorts B;  B;  to\ngenerate each of the above maps,  then used the map to predict clinical outcome in cohort By. \nClinical outcome estimates were based on the similarity between the  ideal  connectivity\nprofile and the connectivity profile from each individual patient  (measured using a Fisher z-\ntransformed spatial correlation coefficient) .  This was done independently for structural and\ndataset  (B; _4)  was then applied to the independent Wiirzburg test data  ( W) . \n\nFinally,  we used the combined dataset  (B; _4+ W;  n= 95) ,  and a general linear model\n (GLM)  combining both structural and functional connectivity profiles to test  (1)  whether the\n2 types of connectivity are independent predictors for clinical outcome and  (2)  how much of\nthe outcome variance can be explained by the 2 connectivity measures combined.  An initial\nGLM was computed based on connectivity estimates alone,  whereas a second GLM\nincluded relevant baseline clinical variables. \n\nTo test how robustly outcome of individual patients could be predicted,  the same GLMs\nwere solved in a leave-one-patient-out fashion.  In other words,  data from 94 patients were\nused to predict the 95th patient and predicted improvement was compared to the actual\nimprovement.  The average prediction error was reported and 3 index patients were selected\nOur DBS cohort included 95 patients across 2 independent datasets  (30 female,  mean age =\n60. 2 + 8. 0 years) ,  68 akinetic-rigid,  19 mixed,  and 8 tremor-dominant cases  (see Table) . \nAverage disease duration was 11. 4 + 4. 3 years,  baseline UPDRS score was 43. 7 + 13. 4,  L-\ndopa response was 57. 6 + 18. 2%,  and UPDRS improvement with DBS was 47. 2 + 22. 4%. \nReduction in LEDD comparing baseline to 12 months post-DBS was 58. 3 %  (1, 250. 0\n\n+ 595. 5 before vs 530. 7 + 389. 2 after surgery) .  DBS response was heterogeneous across the\ndifferences. \n\nBaseline UPDRS score was the only clinical variable predictive of DBS response in both the\nBerlin  (R = 0. 33,  p<0. 02)  and Wiirzburg  (R = 0. 35,  p<0. 02)  cohorts,  with higher baseline\nscores predicting greater percentage improvement.  Age at surgery  (R =  0. 42,  p= 0. 002) \nand female sex  (t= 2. 5,  p= 0. 01)  were predictive in the Berlin but not the Wiirzburg cohort\n (p> 0. 8 for both variables) .  Disease duration  (p> 0. 4) ,  baseline L-dopa response  (p> 0. 15) , \nand baseline LEDD  (p> 0. 1)  were not predictive of DBS outcome in either cohort. \n\nDBS lead placement was roughly similar across our 2 cohorts  (Fig 2) .  Using patient-specific\nelectrode locations and VTAs within the Berlin cohort  (n = 51) ,  we identified numerous\n\nAnn Neurol.

We utilized independent cohorts from different DBS centers, \nand intentionally selected heterogeneous cohorts to ensure reproducibility.  Our cohorts were\noperated on by different surgeons,  had different postoperative imaging,  and had DBS\nresponse measured in different ways.

For example,  in patients with unsatisfactory DBS response,  * the current\nalgorithm may help determine whether response is appropriate to electrode location\n (possibly requiring lead revision)  or due to other potentially treatable factors.  For instance, \nan index patient with poor DBS outcome for whom our model predicted good improvement\n (see Fig 6,  bottom row)  improved to match our prediction after being treated for severe\ndepression on ward. *> This case illustrates the potential of our approach,  but also that many\nfactors other than connectivity influence DBS response,  including age,  baseline severity of\nPD,  L-dopa responsiveness,  and disease subtype.  8-4547 Despite these factors,  our purely\nconnectivity-based model explained 26% of the variance in motor outcome.  Adding\nadditional clinical variables further increased the amount of variance explained by our model\nto 44%.  Interestingly,  L-dopa responsiveness was not a predictor of DBS outcome in our\nstudy,  consistent with other recent work. 47 Whether additional clinical or imaging variables\nwill predict additional variance remains to be tested. \n\nLimitations of our study include heterogeneity between subcohorts of our training dataset.\ncurrent analysis used a widely accepted VTA model. 283! However,  more advanced VTA\nnot designed to contrast the predictive ability of connectivity with anatomy  (ie, \nelectrode/VTA location*8 ,  No prior study has shown that anatomical location alone can\npredict DBS outcome in an independent cohort,  but that does not mean that anatomy would\nnot have been predictive in our case.  Future work is needed to understand the relative\ncontribution of anatomical location and connectivity to predicting outcome. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe study was supported by the Prof.  Klaus Thiemann Foundation  (A.

        "Discussion": "Four main conclusions may be drawn from this study.  First,  a specific pattern of structural\nand functional connectivity with STN DBS electrodes correlates with clinical outcome\nacross patients in PD.  Second,  structural and functional connectivity are independent\npredictors of DBS response.  Third,  connectivity profiles derived from one patient cohort can\npredict clinical outcome in an independent cohort from a different DBS center.  Finally,  we\nillustrate the potential of how connectivity profiles may be used to estimate outcome in\nsingle patients. \n\nThe Connectivity Profile of Effective STN DBS\n\nThere are 3 major differences between the current study and prior work examining the\nconnectivity profile of effective DBS,  both for PD!  and for other disorders.  9!9-!5-!7 First, \nprior work focused on anatomical connectivity alone,  whereas the current study included\nboth anatomical and functional connectivity.  Anatomical connectivity  (based on diffusion\nMRI)  has higher spatial resolution than functional connectivity  (based on fMRI)  and is thus\nmore likely to identify differences between adjacent electrode contacts in the same patient. \n8. 16 However,  when predicting outcome across different patients with variability in electrode\nlocation,  our data suggest that functional connectivity adds predictive value above and\n\nbeyond anatomical connectivity.  This is consistent with other work 25-33\n\nSecond,  the current study used previously collected connectome data rather than\nconnectivity data from the individual patients enrolled in the study.  Connectivity profiles of\neach DBS electrode were thus dependent on the position,  size,  and shape of the\ncorresponding VTA only.  This is a major practical advantage,  as MRI-based connectivity\ndata are not routinely acquired in DBS patients.  As such,  the current study could utilize large\nDBS cohorts across different centers  (n = 95) ,  whereas prior studies requiring patient-\nspecific connectivity have been much smaller  (n<25;  Accolla et al, 8 Vanegas Arroyave et\nal! ) ,  The present approach may prove particularly valuable for emerging DBS indications\nwith a limited number of patients implanted at different centers and heterogeneity in clinical\nresponse. 2+2437 Such DBS datasets may be analyzed retrospectively even if no individual\nconnectivity data were acquired. \n\nAn interesting question is which connectome dataset is best for identifying the connectivity\nprofile of effective DBS.  Normative connectomes from healthy subjects have the advantage\nof large subject numbers,  excellent signal to noise ratio,  and acquisition using unique high-\npower MRI scanners specifically designed for connectivity imaging.  Such normative\n\nAnn Neurol.  Author manuscript;  available in PMC 2018 April 02. \njduosnueyy soujny jduosnueyy soujny jduosnueyy Joujny\n\njduosnueyy Joujny\n\nHorn et al. \n\nPage 9\n\nconnectome data have proven valuable in predicting stroke symptoms from patient-specific\n\n19-23\n\nlesions,  and the present study shows its value in predicting clinical outcome from\n\npatient-specific electrodes.  In contrast,  patient-based connectomes have the advantage of\n\nbetter matching the connectivity of our DBS patients.  Both prior work?\n\nand the current\nresults show that results are similar using normative versus patient-based connectomes. \nFinally,  acquiring connectivity data in each patient provides the best sensitivity to individual\ndifferences,  but the lowest signal to noise ratio.  It is worth noting that our results are broadly\nconsistent with a prior study of STN DBS based on patient-specific connectivity. !  Future\nwork is needed to determine how to best combine the strengths of normative connectomes, \n\npatient-based connectomes,  and connectivity data from individual patients. \n\nOne final difference between the current study and prior work relates to our focus on\nreproducibility across datasets.  We utilized independent cohorts from different DBS centers, \nand intentionally selected heterogeneous cohorts to ensure reproducibility.  Our cohorts were\noperated on by different surgeons,  had different postoperative imaging,  and had DBS\nresponse measured in different ways.  Such heterogeneity could be seen as a limitation,  as it\ndecreases our power for detecting significant results.  However,  that our results were\nsignificant despite this heterogeneity is a major strength and should lead to improved\nreproducibility in other cohorts.  To our knowledge,  this is the first DBS imaging study to test\nfor reproducibility of results across independent and heterogeneous cohorts. \n\nMultimodal Confirmation\n\nThe connectivity profiles identified in the current study are consistent with prior work in PD\npatients using various modalities to identify brain regions modulated by STN DBS. !! Brain\nregions anatomically connected and positively correlated with effective STN electrodes in\nthe current study  (eg,  SMA,  anterior cingulate,  medial prefrontal cortex)  have shown\nincreased activity in neuroimaging studies when STN DBS is turned on.   The activation of\nSMA in particular is hypothesized to occur via activation of fibers within the hyperdirect\npathway.  8-!3 Atrophy in SMA and premotor cortex was also a predictor of DBS outcome in\nPD. 38 Our results confirm the importance of the SMA and to a lesser extent premotor and\nother frontal areas in DBS response \n\nIn contrast to the SMA,  M1 was negatively correlated with effective STN DBS electrodes in\nthe current study.  Patients with a good response had DBS electrodes that were  (functionally) \nnegatively correlated to M1.  Correspondingly,  if DBS is activated,  M1 has been reported to\nshow decreased activity on neuroimaging.   These results suggest that functional connectivity\nmay predict the sign of metabolic changes induced by DBS.  Other work implicating M1 in\nthe pathophysiology of PD includes abnormal connectivity between STN and M129 and\nmodulation of M1 excitability by STN DBS. * \n\nImplications for Network-Targeted Stimulation\n\nBy showing that connectivity predicts the response of individual PD patients to DBS,  the\ncurrent results support the notion that targets of therapeutic brain stimulation may be brain\nnetworks and not individual brain regions. 2+9-!0. !4-17 As such,  different network nodes may\npotentially be targeted by different stimulation modalities with similar therapeutic benefit. \n\nAnn Neurol.

For example,  in patients with unsatisfactory DBS response,  * the current\nalgorithm may help determine whether response is appropriate to electrode location\n (possibly requiring lead revision)  or due to other potentially treatable factors.  For instance, \nan index patient with poor DBS outcome for whom our model predicted good improvement\n (see Fig 6,  bottom row)  improved to match our prediction after being treated for severe\ndepression on ward. *> This case illustrates the potential of our approach,  but also that many\nfactors other than connectivity influence DBS response,  including age,  baseline severity of\nPD,  L-dopa responsiveness,  and disease subtype.  8-4547 Despite these factors,  our purely\nconnectivity-based model explained 26% of the variance in motor outcome.  Adding\nadditional clinical variables further increased the amount of variance explained by our model\nto 44%.  Interestingly,  L-dopa responsiveness was not a predictor of DBS outcome in our\nstudy,  consistent with other recent work. 47 Whether additional clinical or imaging variables\nwill predict additional variance remains to be tested. \n\nLimitations of our study include heterogeneity between subcohorts of our training dataset. \nHowever,  this was intentional to ensure results were robust to cohort differences.  Second,  the\ncurrent analysis used a widely accepted VTA model. 283! However,  more advanced VTA\nmodeling approaches exist that could further improve our results. 4849 Finally,  our study was\nnot designed to contrast the predictive ability of connectivity with anatomy  (ie, \nelectrode/VTA location*8 ,  No prior study has shown that anatomical location alone can\npredict DBS outcome in an independent cohort,  but that does not mean that anatomy would\nnot have been predictive in our case.  Future work is needed to understand the relative\ncontribution of anatomical location and connectivity to predicting outcome. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe study was supported by the Prof.  Klaus Thiemann Foundation  (A.

If so,  one could potentially predict response based on\nconnectivity with the stimulation site and even optimize the DBS target based on\n\nconnectivity. \n\nPage 2\nFour main conclusions may be drawn from this study.  First,  a specific pattern of structural\nand functional connectivity with STN DBS electrodes correlates with clinical outcome\nacross patients in PD.  Second,  structural and functional connectivity are independent\npredictors of DBS response.  Third,  connectivity profiles derived from one patient cohort can\npredict clinical outcome in an independent cohort from a different DBS center.  Finally,  we\nillustrate the potential of how connectivity profiles may be used to estimate outcome in\nsingle patients. \n\nThe Connectivity Profile of Effective STN DBS\n\nThere are 3 major differences between the current study and prior work examining the\nconnectivity profile of effective DBS,  both for PD!  and for other disorders.  9!9-!5-!7 First, \nprior work focused on anatomical connectivity alone,  whereas the current study included\nboth anatomical and functional connectivity.  Anatomical connectivity  (based on diffusion\nMRI)  has higher spatial resolution than functional connectivity  (based on fMRI)  and is thus\nmore likely to identify differences between adjacent electrode contacts in the same patient. \n8. 16 However,  when predicting outcome across different patients with variability in electrode\nlocation,  our data suggest that functional connectivity adds predictive value above and\n\nbeyond anatomical connectivity.  This is consistent with other work 25-33\n\nSecond,  the current study used previously collected connectome data rather than\nconnectivity data from the individual patients enrolled in the study.  Connectivity profiles of\neach DBS electrode were thus dependent on the position,  size,  and shape of the\ncorresponding VTA only.  This is a major practical advantage,  as MRI-based connectivity\ndata are not routinely acquired in DBS patients.  As such,  the current study could utilize large\nDBS cohorts across different centers  (n = 95) ,  whereas prior studies requiring patient-\nspecific connectivity have been much smaller  (n<25;  Accolla et al, 8 Vanegas Arroyave et\nal! ) ,  The present approach may prove particularly valuable for emerging DBS indications\nwith a limited number of patients implanted at different centers and heterogeneity in clinical\nresponse. 2+2437 Such DBS datasets may be analyzed retrospectively even if no individual\nconnectivity data were acquired. \n\nAn interesting question is which connectome dataset is best for identifying the connectivity\nprofile of effective DBS.  Normative connectomes from healthy subjects have the advantage\nof large subject numbers,  excellent signal to noise ratio,  and acquisition using unique high-\npower MRI scanners specifically designed for connectivity imaging.

Author manuscript;  available in PMC 2018 April 02.\nThat the current connectivity profiles were robust enough to predict DBS outcome across\ncohorts and DBS centers leads to the question of whether these connectivity profiles may\nhave clinical utility.  For example,  in patients with unsatisfactory DBS response,  * the current\nalgorithm may help determine whether response is appropriate to electrode location\n (possibly requiring lead revision)  or due to other potentially treatable factors.  For instance, \nan index patient with poor DBS outcome for whom our model predicted good improvement\n (see Fig 6,  bottom row)  improved to match our prediction after being treated for severe\ndepression on ward. *> This case illustrates the potential of our approach,  but also that many\nfactors other than connectivity influence DBS response,  including age,  baseline severity of\nPD,  L-dopa responsiveness,  and disease subtype.  8-4547 Despite these factors,  our purely\nconnectivity-based model explained 26% of the variance in motor outcome.  Adding\nadditional clinical variables further increased the amount of variance explained by our model\nto 44%.  Interestingly,  L-dopa responsiveness was not a predictor of DBS outcome in our\nstudy,  consistent with other recent work. 47 Whether additional clinical or imaging variables\nwill predict additional variance remains to be tested.\n\n1.

This connectivity profile was then used to predict\noutcome in an independent cohort of 44 patients from a different center.\nPatient Cohorts and Imaging\n\nNinety-five DBS patients from 2 different centers were retrospectively included in this study\n (mean age = 60. 2 + 8. 0 years,  29 women) .  The first  training  dataset was from Charit \nUniversitatsmedizin,  Berlin,  whereas the second  test  dataset was from Wiirzburg\nUniversity Hospital  (Table) .  The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki and was approved by the internal review board of Charit Universitatsmedizin or\nWiirzburg University Hospital  (see below) . \n\nAll patients  (both datasets)  underwent DBS surgery for PD and received 2 quadripolar DBS\nelectrodes  (model 3389;  Medtronic,  Minneapolis,  MN) .  All patients received preoperative\nMRI and neuropsychological testing to exclude structural or severe psychiatric\ncomorbidities.  During surgery,  microelectrode recordings were performed to verify lead\nplacement.  Clinical variables,  including age,  sex,  disease duration before surgery,  L-dopa\nresponse  (percentage improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]-III\nON vs OFF)  before surgery and L-dopa equivalent dose  (LEDD)  at baseline,  were recorded\nand tested for predictive value of clinical outcome in a univariate analysis. \n\nThe Berlin  (training)  dataset consisted of 4 subcohorts,  enrolled at different times and for\ndifferent studies.  These subcohorts were intentionally heterogenous in clinical presentation\nWe used our training dataset to evaluate different options for identifying connections\npredictive of clinical outcome.  First,  the connectivity map of each VTA was weighted by\nclinical improvement  (weighted average maps) .  Second,  voxels whose VTA connectivity\nwas correlated with clinical outcome were identified  (R maps) .  Third,  we created maps of\n\nAnn Neurol.

Both structural connectivity  (R = 0. 45,  p = 0. 002)  and functional connectivity  (R=\n0. 34,  p= 0. 03)  were significant predictors of clinical outcome in this independent dataset\ndespite differences in center,  surgeon,  and timing of clinical assessment. \n\nTopography of connectivity to effective DBS sites  (combined maps)  was highly similar\nwhen computed for the Berlin training dataset  (n = 51) ,  Wiirzburg test dataset  (n = 44) ,  and\nfull dataset  (n = 95;  Fig 5) .  Anticorrelation between DBS electrodes and primary motor\ncortex  (M1) ,  as well as structural connectivity to supplementary motor area  (SMA) ,  superior\nfrontal gyrus,  and cerebellum,  was predictive of beneficial outcome in both datasets alone\nand the combined dataset. \n\nBoth structural  (p<0. 006)  and functional  (p<0. 007)  connectivity were independent predictors\nof clinical outcome.  A combined model incorporating both types of connectivity explained\n26. 2% of the clinical variance in DBS response  (correlation between predicted and true\nimprovements of R= 0. 51 at p<10-8) .  Adding clinical variables to this model  (age,  sex,  and\nUPDRS at baseline)  explained 43. 4% of the variance in DBS response  (R = 0. 66 at\np<107!3) ,  In this final model,  structural connectivity,  functional connectivity,  UPDRS at\nbaseline,  and sex were all significant independent predictors of DBS response  (p<0. 05) . \n\nIn a final analysis,  we explored how well we could predict outcome in individual patients\nbased on connectivity of a patient s DBS electrode.  This was done on the combined\n\n (B7_4+ W)  dataset while leaving out the patient in question.  These predictions on average\ndeviated by 15. 7 + 14. 2% from actual UPDRS-III improvements.  For example,  if a patient\nactually improved by 30%,  our connectivity algorithm might predict an improvement of\n45% or 15%.  Including additional clinical variables  (UPDRS at baseline,  age at surgery,  sex) \nto the analysis added little to the clinical predictions based on connectivity alone  (mean error\n= 15. 1 + 11. 8%) .  Three patients selected to illustrate a good responder with an accurate\nprediction,  a poor responder with an accurate prediction,  and a poor responder with an\ninaccurate prediction are shown in Figure 6. \n\nAlthough our normative connectome performed slightly better than our PD connectome in\nour Berlin leave-one-subcohort out analysis,  there is intuitive appeal to using an age-,  sex-, \nand disease-matched connectome.  We therefore repeated all analyses using this PD\n261: 29-46.  [PubMed:  26698227]\n\n7.  Ceballos-Baumann AO,  Boecker H,  Bartenstein P,  et al.

This connectivity profile was then used to predict\noutcome in an independent cohort of 44 patients from a different center.\nPatient Cohorts and Imaging\n\nNinety-five DBS patients from 2 different centers were retrospectively included in this study\n (mean age = 60. 2 + 8. 0 years,  29 women) .  The first  training  dataset was from Charit \nUniversitatsmedizin,  Berlin,  whereas the second  test  dataset was from Wiirzburg\nUniversity Hospital  (Table) .  The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki and was approved by the internal review board of Charit Universitatsmedizin or\nWiirzburg University Hospital  (see below) . \n\nAll patients  (both datasets)  underwent DBS surgery for PD and received 2 quadripolar DBS\nelectrodes  (model 3389;  Medtronic,  Minneapolis,  MN) .  All patients received preoperative\nMRI and neuropsychological testing to exclude structural or severe psychiatric\ncomorbidities.  During surgery,  microelectrode recordings were performed to verify lead\nplacement.  Clinical variables,  including age,  sex,  disease duration before surgery,  L-dopa\nresponse  (percentage improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]-III\nON vs OFF)  before surgery and L-dopa equivalent dose  (LEDD)  at baseline,  were recorded\nand tested for predictive value of clinical outcome in a univariate analysis. \n\nThe Berlin  (training)  dataset consisted of 4 subcohorts,  enrolled at different times and for\ndifferent studies.  These subcohorts were intentionally heterogenous in clinical presentation\nWe used our training dataset to evaluate different options for identifying connections\npredictive of clinical outcome.  First,  the connectivity map of each VTA was weighted by\nclinical improvement  (weighted average maps) .  Second,  voxels whose VTA connectivity\nwas correlated with clinical outcome were identified  (R maps) .  Third,  we created maps of\n\nAnn Neurol.

Both structural connectivity  (R = 0. 45,  p = 0. 002)  and functional connectivity  (R=\n0. 34,  p= 0. 03)  were significant predictors of clinical outcome in this independent dataset\ndespite differences in center,  surgeon,  and timing of clinical assessment. \n\nTopography of connectivity to effective DBS sites  (combined maps)  was highly similar\nwhen computed for the Berlin training dataset  (n = 51) ,  Wiirzburg test dataset  (n = 44) ,  and\nfull dataset  (n = 95;  Fig 5) .  Anticorrelation between DBS electrodes and primary motor\ncortex  (M1) ,  as well as structural connectivity to supplementary motor area  (SMA) ,  superior\nfrontal gyrus,  and cerebellum,  was predictive of beneficial outcome in both datasets alone\nand the combined dataset. \n\nBoth structural  (p<0. 006)  and functional  (p<0. 007)  connectivity were independent predictors\nof clinical outcome.  A combined model incorporating both types of connectivity explained\n26. 2% of the clinical variance in DBS response  (correlation between predicted and true\nimprovements of R= 0. 51 at p<10-8) .  Adding clinical variables to this model  (age,  sex,  and\nUPDRS at baseline)  explained 43. 4% of the variance in DBS response  (R = 0. 66 at\np<107!3) ,  In this final model,  structural connectivity,  functional connectivity,  UPDRS at\nbaseline,  and sex were all significant independent predictors of DBS response  (p<0. 05) . \n\nIn a final analysis,  we explored how well we could predict outcome in individual patients\nbased on connectivity of a patient s DBS electrode.  This was done on the combined\n\n (B7_4+ W)  dataset while leaving out the patient in question.  These predictions on average\ndeviated by 15. 7 + 14. 2% from actual UPDRS-III improvements.  For example,  if a patient\nactually improved by 30%,  our connectivity algorithm might predict an improvement of\n45% or 15%.  Including additional clinical variables  (UPDRS at baseline,  age at surgery,  sex) \nto the analysis added little to the clinical predictions based on connectivity alone  (mean error\n= 15. 1 + 11. 8%) .  Three patients selected to illustrate a good responder with an accurate\nprediction,  a poor responder with an accurate prediction,  and a poor responder with an\ninaccurate prediction are shown in Figure 6. \n\nAlthough our normative connectome performed slightly better than our PD connectome in\nour Berlin leave-one-subcohort out analysis,  there is intuitive appeal to using an age-,  sex-, \nand disease-matched connectome.  We therefore repeated all analyses using this PD\n261: 29-46.  [PubMed:  26698227]\n\n7.  Ceballos-Baumann AO,  Boecker H,  Bartenstein P,  et al.

        "Conclusion": "and functional connectivity with STN DBS electrodes correlates with clinical outcome\nacross patients in PD.  Second,  structural and functional connectivity are independent\npredictors of DBS response.  Third,  connectivity profiles derived from one patient cohort can\npredict clinical outcome in an independent cohort from a different DBS center.  Finally,  we\nillustrate the potential of how connectivity profiles may be used to estimate outcome in\nsingle patients. \n\nThe Connectivity Profile of Effective STN DBS\n\nThere are 3 major differences between the current study and prior work examining the\nconnectivity profile of effective DBS,  both for PD!  and for other disorders.  9!9-!5-!7 First, \nprior work focused on anatomical connectivity alone,  whereas the current study included\nboth anatomical and functional connectivity.  Anatomical connectivity  (based on diffusion\nMRI)  has higher spatial resolution than functional connectivity  (based on fMRI)  and is thus\nmore likely to identify differences between adjacent electrode contacts in the same patient. \n8. 16 However,  when predicting outcome across different patients with variability in electrode\nlocation,  our data suggest that functional connectivity adds predictive value above and\n\nbeyond anatomical connectivity.  This is consistent with other work 25-33\n\nSecond,  the current study used previously collected connectome data rather than\nconnectivity data from the individual patients enrolled in the study.  Connectivity profiles of\neach DBS electrode were thus dependent on the position,  size,  and shape of the\ncorresponding VTA only.  This is a major practical advantage,  as MRI-based connectivity\ndata are not routinely acquired in DBS patients.  As such,  the current study could utilize large\nDBS cohorts across different centers  (n = 95) ,  whereas prior studies requiring patient-\nspecific connectivity have been much smaller  (n<25;  Accolla et al, 8 Vanegas Arroyave et\nal! ) ,  The present approach may prove particularly valuable for emerging DBS indications\nwith a limited number of patients implanted at different centers and heterogeneity in clinical\nresponse. 2+2437 Such DBS datasets may be analyzed retrospectively even if no individual\nconnectivity data were acquired. \n\nAn interesting question is which connectome dataset is best for identifying the connectivity\nprofile of effective DBS.  Normative connectomes from healthy subjects have the advantage\nof large subject numbers,  excellent signal to noise ratio,  and acquisition using unique high-\npower MRI scanners specifically designed for connectivity imaging.

        "Abstract": "During development,  the healthy human brain constructs a host of large-scale,  distributed,  function-\ncritical neural networks.  Neurodegenerative diseases have been thought to target these systems,  but\nthis hypothesis has not been systematically tested in living humans.  We used network-sensitive\nneuroimaging methods to show that five different neurodegenerative syndromes cause circumscribed\natrophy within five distinct healthy human intrinsic functional connectivity networks.  We further\ndiscovered a direct link between intrinsic connectivity and gray matter structure.  Across healthy\nindividuals,  nodes within each functional network exhibited tightly correlated gray matter volumes. \nThe findings suggest that human neural networks can be defined by synchronous baseline activity, \na unified corticotrophic fate,  and selective vulnerability to neurodegenerative illness.  Future studies\nmay clarify how these complex systems are assembled during development and undermined by\ndisease.\nDuring development,  the healthy human brain constructs a host of large-scale,  distributed,  function-\ncritical neural networks.

        "Results": "Page 2\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases cause progressive,  incapacitating cognitive,  behavioral,  and motor\ndysfunction.  Early on,  misfolded disease proteins aggregate within small,  selectively\nvulnerable neuron populations that reside in specific brain regions  (Graveland et al. ,  1985; \nHyman et al. ,  1984;  Seeley et al. ,  2006) .  Synapses falter,  and damage spreads to new regions, \naccompanied by worsening clinical deficits  (Selkoe,  2002) .  Often,  later-affected regions bear\nknown anatomical connections with the sites of earlier injury  (Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  Based on\nneuropathology  (Braak and Braak,  1991) ,  neuroimaging  (Buckner et al. ,  2005;  Greicius et al. , \n2004) ,  and evidence from transgenic animal models  (Palop et al. ,  2007) ,  some authors have\nsuggested that neurodegeneration may relate to neural network dysfunction  (Buckner et al. , \n2005;  Palop et al. ,  2006) .  In human spongiform encephalopathies,  which cause rapidly\nprogressive dementia through conformational changes in misfolded prion protein,  direct\nevidence supports disease propagation along transsynaptic connections  (Scott et al. ,  1992) .  For\nall other neurodegenerative diseases,  limited human experimental data support the  network\ndegeneration hypothesis .  If demonstrated as a class-wide phenomenon,  however,  this\nframework would have major mechanistic significance,  predicting that the spatial patterning\nof disease relates to some structural,  metabolic,  or physiological aspect of neural network\nbiology.  Confirming the network degeneration hypothesis would also have clinical impact, \nstimulating development of new network-based diagnostic and disease-monitoring assays. \n\nTo test the network degeneration hypothesis in living humans,  we studied patients with five\n\ndistinct neurodegenerative syndromes and two healthy control groups  (Figure 1) .  Only early\n\nage-of-onset dementia syndromes were included,  enabling us to better match patient groups\n\nfor age and other demographic variables  (Table $1) .  Patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's\ndisease  (AD,  n = 24) ,  behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD,  n = 24) ,  semantic\ndementia  (SD,  n= 24) ,  progressive nonfluent aphasia  (PNFA, n = 13) ,  or corticobasal syndrome\n (CBS,  n = 17) ,  based on standard research criteria.  Diagnoses were made on clinical grounds, \ntherefore neuroimaging and pathological data did not influence group membership.  To weight\nour analyses toward the distinctive,  early-stage neuroanatomic features of each syndrome,  we\nexcluded patients with moderate or severe dementia  (defined by Clinical Dementia Rating scale\nscores > 1) .  After defining the patient groups,  we conducted a series of quantitative structural\nand functional imaging analyses in patients and controls to test the hypothesis that syndrome-\nassociated regional degeneration patterns reflect distinct human neural network architectures. \n\nEach neurodegenerative syndrome features a distinct regional vulnerability pattern\n\nFirst,  we established each syndrome's functional and anatomical deficit profiles compared to\n65 healthy,  age-matched controls  (Table S1 and Figure 2A) .  A standard neuropsychological\nbattery was administered,  and MR voxel-based morphometry  (VBM)  facilitated whole-brain\nstatistical parametric grey matter comparisons between each patient group and controls.  The\nfindings replicated previous work,  performed by our group and others,  on the five syndromes\n (Boccardi et al. ,  2005; Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004; Josephs et al. ,  2006; Josephs et al. , \n2008; Seeley et al. ,  2005; Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  In summary,  AD was associated with episodic\nmemory dysfunction and prominent medial temporal,  posterior cingulate/precuneus,  and\nlateral temporoparietal atrophy.  BVFTD,  SD,  and PNFA,  which together make up the clinical\nfrontotemporal dementia  (FTD)  spectrum,  each showed a unique deficit signature.  ByVFTD\nfeatured prominent behavioral deficits with anterior cingulate,  frontoinsular,  striatal,  and\nfrontopolar degeneration.  SD resulted in loss of word and object meaning accompanied by left-\npredominant temporal pole and subgenual cingulate involvement.  PNFA presented with\nnonfluent,  effortful,  and agrammatic speech and was associated with left frontal operculum, \ndorsal anterior insula,  and precentral gyrus atrophy.  Patients with CBS had prominent, \nasymmetric sensorimotor impairment,  with akinesia,  rigidity,  apraxia,  and cortical sensory loss\n\nNeuron.

The early-stage,  syndrome-specific anatomical patterns provided seed regions for our\nsubsequent network analyses in healthy controls. \n\nSyndromic atrophy foci anchor large-scale functional networks in the healthy brain\n\nThe network degeneration hypothesis predicts that syndromic atrophy patterns should\nrecapitulate healthy functional network architectures.  To evaluate this possibility,  we identified\nthe most atrophied cortical region in each patient group  (Figure 2A,  Table $2)  and used these\nregions of interest  (ROIs)  to seed ICN mapping experiments in a separate group of 19 healthy\ncontrols  (HC2) .  These controls,  also age-matched to the patient groups,  underwent six minutes\nof task-free fMRI scanning.  From these data,  we extracted the mean BOLD signal timeseries\nfrom the five syndrome-associated ROIs and entered these timeseries into five separate whole\nbrain intrinsic functional connectivity analyses.  The resulting ROI-based network maps then\nserved as spatial templates for independent component analysis  (ICA) ,  following previous\napproaches  (Greicius et al. ,  2004;  Seeley et al. ,  2007) .  Next,  we identified a best-fit ICA-\ngenerated component for each network template for each subject and combined these\ncomponents to produce group-level network maps for each seed ROI.  As anticipated,  the five\ndisease-vulnerable ROIs anchored five distinct ICNs in healthy controls  (Figure 2B) . \nRemarkably,  as predicted by the network degeneration hypothesis,  these distributed network\nmaps,  though generated from isolated cortical seed ROIs,  closely mirrored the atrophy patterns\nseen in the five neurodegenerative syndromes  (Figures 2 and 3) . \n\nNormal structural covariance patterns mirror intrinsic functional connectivity\n\nPhysiological studies have shown that synchronous neuronal firing promotes network-based\nsynaptogenesis  (Bi and Poo,  1999;  Katz and Shatz,  1996) .  Therefore,  we further questioned\nwhether coherent spontaneous ICN activity might impact normal cortical structure. \nSpecifically,  we hypothesized that functionally correlated brain regions would show correlated\ngray matter volumes across healthy subjects.  One previous VBM study,  though not designed\nto assess the relationship between functional connectivity and structure,  selected landmark-\nbased cortical and limbic ROIs and found group-level gray matter density correlations between\nthese ROIs and homologous contralateral and functionally related ipsilateral regions  (Mechelli\net al. ,  2005) .  We adapted these methods to study structural covariance patterns arising from\ndisease-vulnerable foci,  applying the same seed ROIs  (Figure 2A,  Table S2)  used to probe our\nintrinsic functional connectivity data.  Local ROI mean gray matter intensities extracted from\nthe five seeds provided covariates for five separate whole brain statistical parametric regression\nanalyses in which age and gender were entered as nuisance covariates.  These studies revealed\nstriking convergence between healthy intrinsic functional connectivity,  derived within subjects\n (Figures 2B,  3B,  4A-B) ,  and structural covariance,  assessed across subjects  (Figures 2C,  3C, \n4C-D) .  As a result,  our three data streams converged  (Figures 5-6) .  That is,  normal ICN and\nstructural covariance patterns mirrored each other and reflected,  with high fidelity,  those\nregions that co-degenerate in distinct human neurodegenerative syndromes.  BVFTD was\nchosen to highlight convergence of the three maps in greater detail  (Figure 3) .  ROI functional\ntimeseries from a representative control subject  (Figure 4A-B)  and related group-level\nstructural correlation plots  (Figure 4C-D)  further illustrate the brain's shared functional-\nstructural covariance architecture. \n\nDisease-vulnerable networks are dissociable:  spatial similarity and overlap analyses\n\nTo quantify the spatial similarity between each atrophy pattern and the healthy functional-\nstructural covariance networks,  we used the ten control group correlation maps  (5 functional, \n5 structural)  to generate goodness-of-fit  (GOF)  scores to each syndromic atrophy map.

These analyses indicated a strong fit between the intrinsic functional\nand structural covariance maps and their  source  atrophy patterns  (Figure SA,  C) .  Although\nonly a small,  single ROI from each source map  (Figure 2A)  was used to seed the ICN and\nstructural covariance analyses,  the resulting healthy networks fit better with their source\natrophy maps than with the other four disease patterns. \n\nTo confirm our group-level spatial similarity findings,  we used each HC2 subject's best-fit ICA\ncomponents  (one for each seed ROI)  to generate individual GOF scores to the source and other\natrophy maps  (Figure 5B) .  Paired samples t-tests  (N = 19,  2-tailed)  showed significant source\nvs.  other GOF differences for all five ICNs  (right ANG:  t = 6. 9,  p = 0. 000002;  right FI:  t=2. 4, \np = 0. 03;  left Tpole:  t = 7. 4,  p = 0. 0000007;  left IFG:  t = 4. 7,  p = 0. 0002;  right PMC:  t = 8. 6, \np = 0. 00000009;  mean of all seeds:  t = 8. 8,  p = 0. 00000006) .  The least strong  (though still\nsignificant)  source vs.  other GOF statistical difference involved the right FI ICN.  As\nhighlighted in Figure 3A-C,  this ICN and its structural covariance counterpart map showed\nrobust qualitative similarity to the bvFTD atrophy map at the group level.  We derived further\nsupport for the close atrophy-ICN relationship by comparing each HC2 subject's first and\nsecond best-fit ICA components,  for each ICN,  to the relevant source atrophy maps  (see\nExperimental Procedures) .  This analysis confirmed a sharp GOF drop-off from the 1  to 24\nbest fitting ICA components  (paired samples t-tests:  right ANG,  t = 7. 3,  p = 0. 0000009;  right\nFI,  t= 5. 3,  p = 0. 00005;  left Tpole,  t = 8. 6,  p = 0. 00000008;  left IFG,  t = 4. 7,  p = 0. 0002;  right\nPMC,  t = 5. 1;  p = 0. 00008) .  By definition,  the remaining  (unselected)  components  (3\" best-\nfit and beyond)  for each subject fit the relevant atrophy patterns even less well.  Therefore,  our\nICA and component selection procedures effectively identified the five normal ICNs that\ncorrespond best to the five syndromic atrophy patterns. \n\nFinally,  to visualize the spatial relationships among the five disease-vulnerable networks,  we\ndetermined the voxel-wise  (whole brain)  overlap of each 3-map set  (atrophy,  intrinsic\nfunctional connectivity,  and structural covariance associated with each ROD)  and plotted the\nfive resulting overlap maps on a shared template.  Because we hypothesized that the five\nsystems would prove dissociable,  we lowered the statistical threshold for each map used to\ncreate the overlaps  (see Experimental Procedures) ,  in effect reducing our power to demonstrate\nspatial divergence among the five networks.  Nonetheless,  the five overlap maps showed\nminimal overlap with each other  (Figure 6) ,  illustrating the dissociable nature of these targeted\nbrain systems.\na unified corticotrophic fate,  and selective vulnerability to neurodegenerative illness.  Future studies\nmay clarify how these complex systems are assembled during development and undermined by\ndisease.\nPage 2\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases cause progressive,  incapacitating cognitive,  behavioral,  and motor\ndysfunction.  Early on,  misfolded disease proteins aggregate within small,  selectively\nvulnerable neuron populations that reside in specific brain regions  (Graveland et al. ,  1985; \nHyman et al. ,  1984;  Seeley et al. ,  2006) .  Synapses falter,  and damage spreads to new regions, \naccompanied by worsening clinical deficits  (Selkoe,  2002) .  Often,  later-affected regions bear\nknown anatomical connections with the sites of earlier injury  (Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  Based on\nneuropathology  (Braak and Braak,  1991) ,  neuroimaging  (Buckner et al. ,  2005;  Greicius et al. , \n2004) ,  and evidence from transgenic animal models  (Palop et al. ,  2007) ,  some authors have\nsuggested that neurodegeneration may relate to neural network dysfunction  (Buckner et al. , \n2005;  Palop et al. ,  2006) .  In human spongiform encephalopathies,  which cause rapidly\nprogressive dementia through conformational changes in misfolded prion protein,  direct\nevidence supports disease propagation along transsynaptic connections  (Scott et al. ,  1992) .  For\nall other neurodegenerative diseases,  limited human experimental data support the  network\ndegeneration hypothesis .  If demonstrated as a class-wide phenomenon,  however,  this\nframework would have major mechanistic significance,  predicting that the spatial patterning\nof disease relates to some structural,  metabolic,  or physiological aspect of neural network\nbiology.  Confirming the network degeneration hypothesis would also have clinical impact, \nstimulating development of new network-based diagnostic and disease-monitoring assays. \n\nTo test the network degeneration hypothesis in living humans,  we studied patients with five\n\ndistinct neurodegenerative syndromes and two healthy control groups  (Figure 1) .  Only early\n\nage-of-onset dementia syndromes were included,  enabling us to better match patient groups\n\nfor age and other demographic variables  (Table $1) .  Patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's\ndisease  (AD,  n = 24) ,  behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD,  n = 24) ,  semantic\ndementia  (SD,  n= 24) ,  progressive nonfluent aphasia  (PNFA, n = 13) ,  or corticobasal syndrome\n (CBS,  n = 17) ,  based on standard research criteria.  Diagnoses were made on clinical grounds, \ntherefore neuroimaging and pathological data did not influence group membership.

First,  we characterized five early-stage dementia\nsyndromes to isolate five circumscribed atrophy patterns,  replicating and extending previous\nal. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  We then demonstrated that these spatial disease patterns reflect\nthe healthy brain's intrinsic functional network architecture.  Although we and others have noted\nthe concordance between AD-related atrophy and healthy intrinsic functional connectivity\n (Buckner et al. ,  2005;  Greicius et al. ,  2004) ,  in this study we confirmed the network\ndegeneration hypothesis across five distinct dementia syndromes.  Because these syndromes\ndescribe the clinical rather than molecular disease features,  and because each syndrome can\nresult from diverse underlying molecular pathologies,  our data suggest that numerous disease\nproteins,  including B-amyloid,  tau,  alpha-synuclein,  and TDP-43,  have the capacity to misfold\nand aggregate with specific brain networks. \n\nNeuron.

The ICN targeted\nin bvFTD  (right FI seed)  was first identified with ICA  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005)  and later linked\nto emotional salience processing capacities  (Seeley et al. ,  2007)  lost in early bvFTD  (Seeley, \n2008) .  SD affects an ICN  (left temporal pole seed)  that has escaped previous detection in\nhumans but corresponds to a temporal pole-subgenual cingulate-ventral striatum-amygdala\nnetwork,  well-established in non-human primates  (Mesulam and Mufson,  1982) ,  that shows\nprogressive atrophy in early-stage SD  (Brambati et al. ,  2007) .  The PNFA-targeted ICN  (left\nIFG seed)  includes the frontal operculum,  primary and supplementary motor cortices,  and\ninferior parietal lobule bilaterally,  linking the language and motor systems that enable speech\nfluency.  This ICN,  often divided into left and right hemispheric systems,  has been noted in\nseveral previous studies  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005;  Damoiseaux et al. ,  2006;  De Luca et al. , \n2006;  van den Heuvel et al. ,  2008) .  In PNFA,  asymmetric degeneration of this system may\nreflect its accentuated functional and connectional asymmetry in healthy humans  (Stark et al. , \n2008) .  In CBS,  prominent skeletal and ocular motor abnormalities result from disease within\na dorsal sensorimotor association network  (right PMC seed)  detailed in several ICN studies\n (De Luca et al. ,  2006;  Fox et al. ,  2005;  Vincent et al. ,  2008)  and elegantly mapped in the\ngray matter volume.  This finding builds on existing notions of  small worldness  in human\ncortical gray matter structure  (He et al. ,  2007)  by demonstrating a direct,  network-based\nfunction-structure relationship.  Why gray matter function and volume correlate,  however, \nremains unclear.  During development,  network covariance may emerge  (Fair et al. ,  2008)  and\nremodel itself  (Kelly et al. ,  2008;  Lerch et al. ,  2006)  in response to core inherited projection\nmap formation scripts  (Ruthazer and Cline,  2004)  that interact with the environment to drive\nindividual differences in cognitive,  emotional,  and motor function  (Seeley et al. ,  2007) .  Use-\nrelated trophic effects,  in turn,  may continue to reshape the cortical mantle throughout\nadulthood  (Maguire et al. ,  2000) ,  linking synaptic strength,  synaptic density ,  and neuropil mass\nwithin functionally co-active regions.\nnot performed. \n\nTo visualize the spatial overlap within related atrophy,  functional connectivity,  and structural\ncovariance maps,  we loaded all three maps as overlays,  rendered at less stringent statistical\nthresholds  (atrophy:  p < 0. 0001,  uncorrected;  functional connectivity:  ICA maps at p < 0. 01\njoint height and extent thresholds,  corrected at the whole brain level;  structural covariance:  p\n< 0. 0001,  uncorrected) ,  and determined the intersection of the three maps,  defined as those\nvoxels contained in 3/3 maps at these thresholds.  This procedure allowed us to demonstrate\nthe convergence of the three maps within each set,  as well as the spatial dissimilarity between\nthe five separate 3-map sets  (Figure 6) .\n\n\non representative sections of the MNI template brain.

If demonstrated as a class-wide phenomenon,  however,  this\nframework would have major mechanistic significance,  predicting that the spatial patterning\nof disease relates to some structural,  metabolic,  or physiological aspect of neural network\nbiology.  Confirming the network degeneration hypothesis would also have clinical impact, \nstimulating development of new network-based diagnostic and disease-monitoring assays. \n\nTo test the network degeneration hypothesis in living humans,  we studied patients with five\n\ndistinct neurodegenerative syndromes and two healthy control groups  (Figure 1) .  Only early\n\nage-of-onset dementia syndromes were included,  enabling us to better match patient groups\n\nfor age and other demographic variables  (Table $1) .  Patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's\ndisease  (AD,  n = 24) ,  behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD,  n = 24) ,  semantic\ndementia  (SD,  n= 24) ,  progressive nonfluent aphasia  (PNFA, n = 13) ,  or corticobasal syndrome\n (CBS,  n = 17) ,  based on standard research criteria.  Diagnoses were made on clinical grounds, \ntherefore neuroimaging and pathological data did not influence group membership.  To weight\nour analyses toward the distinctive,  early-stage neuroanatomic features of each syndrome,  we\nexcluded patients with moderate or severe dementia  (defined by Clinical Dementia Rating scale\nscores > 1) .  After defining the patient groups,  we conducted a series of quantitative structural\nand functional imaging analyses in patients and controls to test the hypothesis that syndrome-\nassociated regional degeneration patterns reflect distinct human neural network architectures. \n\nEach neurodegenerative syndrome features a distinct regional vulnerability pattern\n\nFirst,  we established each syndrome's functional and anatomical deficit profiles compared to\n65 healthy,  age-matched controls  (Table S1 and Figure 2A) .  A standard neuropsychological\nbattery was administered,  and MR voxel-based morphometry  (VBM)  facilitated whole-brain\nstatistical parametric grey matter comparisons between each patient group and controls.  The\n(Boccardi et al. ,  2005; Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004; Josephs et al. ,  2006; Josephs et al. ,\ncomponents  (one for each seed ROI)  to generate individual GOF scores to the source and other\natrophy maps  (Figure 5B) .  Paired samples t-tests  (N = 19,  2-tailed)  showed significant source\nvs.  other GOF differences for all five ICNs  (right ANG:  t = 6. 9,  p = 0. 000002;  right FI:  t=2. 4, \np = 0. 03;  left Tpole:  t = 7. 4,  p = 0. 0000007;  left IFG:  t = 4. 7,  p = 0. 0002;  right PMC:  t = 8. 6, \np = 0. 00000009;  mean of all seeds:  t = 8. 8,  p = 0. 00000006) .  The least strong  (though still\nsignificant)  source vs.  other GOF statistical difference involved the right FI ICN.  As\nhighlighted in Figure 3A-C,  this ICN and its structural covariance counterpart map showed\nrobust qualitative similarity to the bvFTD atrophy map at the group level.  We derived further\nsupport for the close atrophy-ICN relationship by comparing each HC2 subject's first and\nsecond best-fit ICA components,  for each ICN,  to the relevant source atrophy maps  (see\nExperimental Procedures) .  This analysis confirmed a sharp GOF drop-off from the 1  to 24\nbest fitting ICA components  (paired samples t-tests:  right ANG,  t = 7. 3,  p = 0. 0000009;  right\nFI,  t= 5. 3,  p = 0. 00005;  left Tpole,  t = 8. 6,  p = 0. 00000008;  left IFG,  t = 4. 7,  p = 0. 0002;  right\nPMC,  t = 5. 1;  p = 0. 00008) .  By definition,  the remaining  (unselected)  components  (3\" best-\nfit and beyond)  for each subject fit the relevant atrophy patterns even less well.  Therefore,  our\nICA and component selection procedures effectively identified the five normal ICNs that\ncorrespond best to the five syndromic atrophy patterns. \n\nFinally,  to visualize the spatial relationships among the five disease-vulnerable networks,  we\ndetermined the voxel-wise  (whole brain)  overlap of each 3-map set  (atrophy,  intrinsic\nfunctional connectivity,  and structural covariance associated with each ROD)  and plotted the\nfive resulting overlap maps on a shared template.  Because we hypothesized that the five\nsystems would prove dissociable,  we lowered the statistical threshold for each map used to\ncreate the overlaps  (see Experimental Procedures) ,  in effect reducing our power to demonstrate\nspatial divergence among the five networks.  Nonetheless,  the five overlap maps showed\nminimal overlap with each other  (Figure 6) ,  illustrating the dissociable nature of these targeted\nbrain systems.\nconvergent,  anatomically predictable networks,  and that specific neurodegenerative diseases\ntarget these patterned brain systems.  First,  we characterized five early-stage dementia\nsyndromes to isolate five circumscribed atrophy patterns,  replicating and extending previous\nal. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  We then demonstrated that these spatial disease patterns reflect\nthe healthy brain's intrinsic functional network architecture.  Although we and others have noted\nthe concordance between AD-related atrophy and healthy intrinsic functional connectivity\n (Buckner et al. ,  2005;  Greicius et al. ,  2004) ,  in this study we confirmed the network\ndegeneration hypothesis across five distinct dementia syndromes.  Because these syndromes\ndescribe the clinical rather than molecular disease features,  and because each syndrome can\nresult from diverse underlying molecular pathologies,  our data suggest that numerous disease\nproteins,  including B-amyloid,  tau,  alpha-synuclein,  and TDP-43,  have the capacity to misfold\nand aggregate with specific brain networks. \n\nNeuron.

The ICN targeted\nin bvFTD  (right FI seed)  was first identified with ICA  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005)  and later linked\nto emotional salience processing capacities  (Seeley et al. ,  2007)  lost in early bvFTD  (Seeley, \n2008) .  SD affects an ICN  (left temporal pole seed)  that has escaped previous detection in\nhumans but corresponds to a temporal pole-subgenual cingulate-ventral striatum-amygdala\nnetwork,  well-established in non-human primates  (Mesulam and Mufson,  1982) ,  that shows\nprogressive atrophy in early-stage SD  (Brambati et al. ,  2007) .  The PNFA-targeted ICN  (left\nIFG seed)  includes the frontal operculum,  primary and supplementary motor cortices,  and\ninferior parietal lobule bilaterally,  linking the language and motor systems that enable speech\nfluency.  This ICN,  often divided into left and right hemispheric systems,  has been noted in\nseveral previous studies  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005;  Damoiseaux et al. ,  2006;  De Luca et al. , \n2006;  van den Heuvel et al. ,  2008) .  In PNFA,  asymmetric degeneration of this system may\nreflect its accentuated functional and connectional asymmetry in healthy humans  (Stark et al. , \n2008) .  In CBS,  prominent skeletal and ocular motor abnormalities result from disease within\na dorsal sensorimotor association network  (right PMC seed)  detailed in several ICN studies\n (De Luca et al. ,  2006;  Fox et al. ,  2005;  Vincent et al. ,  2008)  and elegantly mapped in the\ngray matter volume.  This finding builds on existing notions of  small worldness  in human\ncortical gray matter structure  (He et al. ,  2007)  by demonstrating a direct,  network-based\nfunction-structure relationship.  Why gray matter function and volume correlate,  however, \nremains unclear.  During development,  network covariance may emerge  (Fair et al. ,  2008)  and\nremodel itself  (Kelly et al. ,  2008;  Lerch et al. ,  2006)  in response to core inherited projection\nmap formation scripts  (Ruthazer and Cline,  2004)  that interact with the environment to drive\nindividual differences in cognitive,  emotional,  and motor function  (Seeley et al. ,  2007) .  Use-\nrelated trophic effects,  in turn,  may continue to reshape the cortical mantle throughout\nadulthood  (Maguire et al. ,  2000) ,  linking synaptic strength,  synaptic density ,  and neuropil mass\nwithin functionally co-active regions.\nnot performed. \n\nTo visualize the spatial overlap within related atrophy,  functional connectivity,  and structural\ncovariance maps,  we loaded all three maps as overlays,  rendered at less stringent statistical\nthresholds  (atrophy:  p < 0. 0001,  uncorrected;  functional connectivity:  ICA maps at p < 0. 01\njoint height and extent thresholds,  corrected at the whole brain level;  structural covariance:  p\n< 0. 0001,  uncorrected) ,  and determined the intersection of the three maps,  defined as those\nvoxels contained in 3/3 maps at these thresholds.  This procedure allowed us to demonstrate\nthe convergence of the three maps within each set,  as well as the spatial dissimilarity between\nthe five separate 3-map sets  (Figure 6) . \n\nSupplementary Material\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\non representative sections of the MNI template brain.

        "Discussion": "Our results show that functional and structural network mapping approaches yield robust, \nconvergent,  anatomically predictable networks,  and that specific neurodegenerative diseases\ntarget these patterned brain systems.  First,  we characterized five early-stage dementia\nsyndromes to isolate five circumscribed atrophy patterns,  replicating and extending previous\nfindings  (Boccardi et al. ,  2005;  Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004;  Josephs et al. ,  2006;  Josephs et\nal. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2008a) .  We then demonstrated that these spatial disease patterns reflect\nthe healthy brain's intrinsic functional network architecture.  Although we and others have noted\nthe concordance between AD-related atrophy and healthy intrinsic functional connectivity\n (Buckner et al. ,  2005;  Greicius et al. ,  2004) ,  in this study we confirmed the network\ndegeneration hypothesis across five distinct dementia syndromes.  Because these syndromes\ndescribe the clinical rather than molecular disease features,  and because each syndrome can\nresult from diverse underlying molecular pathologies,  our data suggest that numerous disease\nproteins,  including B-amyloid,  tau,  alpha-synuclein,  and TDP-43,  have the capacity to misfold\nand aggregate with specific brain networks. \n\nNeuron.

Our AD-\naffected ICN  (right ANG seed)  corresponds to the  default mode network  that participates in\nepisodic memory  (Buckner et al. ,  2005)  and became known for its task-related deactivations\nacross {MRI studies  (Fox et al. ,  2005;  Fransson,  2005;  Greicius et al. ,  2003) .  The ICN targeted\nin bvFTD  (right FI seed)  was first identified with ICA  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005)  and later linked\nto emotional salience processing capacities  (Seeley et al. ,  2007)  lost in early bvFTD  (Seeley, \n2008) .  SD affects an ICN  (left temporal pole seed)  that has escaped previous detection in\nhumans but corresponds to a temporal pole-subgenual cingulate-ventral striatum-amygdala\nnetwork,  well-established in non-human primates  (Mesulam and Mufson,  1982) ,  that shows\nprogressive atrophy in early-stage SD  (Brambati et al. ,  2007) .  The PNFA-targeted ICN  (left\nIFG seed)  includes the frontal operculum,  primary and supplementary motor cortices,  and\ninferior parietal lobule bilaterally,  linking the language and motor systems that enable speech\nfluency.  This ICN,  often divided into left and right hemispheric systems,  has been noted in\nseveral previous studies  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005;  Damoiseaux et al. ,  2006;  De Luca et al. , \n2006;  van den Heuvel et al. ,  2008) .  In PNFA,  asymmetric degeneration of this system may\nreflect its accentuated functional and connectional asymmetry in healthy humans  (Stark et al. , \n2008) .  In CBS,  prominent skeletal and ocular motor abnormalities result from disease within\na dorsal sensorimotor association network  (right PMC seed)  detailed in several ICN studies\n (De Luca et al. ,  2006;  Fox et al. ,  2005;  Vincent et al. ,  2008)  and elegantly mapped in the\nmacaque using convergent ICN,  oculomotor task-based fMRI,  and axonal tracer methods\n (Vincent et al. ,  2007) .  ICNs frequently reported  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005;  Damoiseaux et al. , \n2006;  De Luca et al. ,  2006;  van den Heuvel et al. ,  2008)  but not studied here include primary\nand secondary visual networks that may provide substrate for the visual-spatial variant of AD\nknown as the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome  (Hof et al. ,  1997) ,  a primary sensorimotor\nICN that may relate to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (Kassubek et al. ,  2005) ,  and a lateral\nfrontoparietal executive-control network  (Seeley et al. ,  2007;  Vincent et al. ,  2008)  that falters\nin most neurodegenerative diseases as degeneration spreads beyond the sites of initial injury\ninto widely interconnected supervisory neocortical systems. \n\nConfirmation of the network degeneration hypothesis raises important questions about how\nspecific syndromes will impact ICN strength.  Previous studies suggest that AD attenuates\nconnectivity within the right ANG  ( default mode )  network  (Greicius et al. ,  2004;  Supekar\net al. ,  2008) ,  even during early clinical stages  (Sorg et al. ,  2007) .  Task-based episodic memory\nfMRI studies,  in contrast,  suggest heightened hippocampal activation during prodromal AD\n (Dickerson et al. ,  2004) ,  and an AD intrinsic connectivity study revealed focal frontal\nconnectivity enhancements  (Supekar et al. ,  2008) .  For the non-AD dementia syndromes,  no\npublished ICN data are available.  Therefore,  it remains uncertain whether disease causes\nnetwork connectivity impairment,  upregulation,  or effects that vary by disease stage.  This issue\nrequires clarification before network connectivity approaches can be used to diagnose dementia\nor track its progression.  Those patients who scale up connectivity within early-affected\nnetworks or unaffected compensatory systems may prove more resilient to functional decline. \nEven more intriguingly,  patients with focal connectivity enhancements may develop new or\nintensified functional capabilities  (Seeley et al. ,  2008b) . \n\nWhy does neurodegeneration spread throughout specific neural networks? The present study\nwas designed to raise rather than answer this question,  but several mechanisms may apply. \nFirst,  selective neuronal vulnerability within key synaptic convergence zones may disconnect\nor weaken functional circuits  (Hyman et al. ,  1984) ,  inducing deleterious network-wide\ncompensatory strategies.  This notion fits with AD transgenic mouse models,  in which aberrant\nmedial temporal circuit excitability disrupts homeostasis and function,  leading to progressive\ndegeneration within the circuit  (Palop et al. , 2006;  Palop et al. , 2007) .  Second,  retrograde axonal\ntransport deficits may cut off growth factor supply to long-range projection neurons,  begetting\naxonal degeneration,  synapse loss,  and post-synaptic dendrite retraction  (Salehi et al. ,  2006) . \n\nNeuron.  Author manuscript;  available in PMC 2010 April 16. \nyduosnuey JouINY Wd-HIN yduosnuew JouINY Wd-HIN\n\nyduosnuew JouNY Vd-HIN\n\nSeeley et al. \n\nPage 6\n\nThird,  as seen in experimental prion disease,  misfolded disease proteins may themselves\npropagate along neural processes,  marching throughout local and then long-range circuits via\ntranssynaptic spread  (Scott et al. ,  1992) .  This account of our data would require that non-prion\nmisfolded disease proteins could trigger misfolding of adjacent same-species proteins,  which, \nin turn,  could cascade down processes and between interconnected neurons.  Although many\naspects of this candidate mechanism remain unexplored,  in a recent study pathological tau\nconformers were shown to induce native  (unfolded)  tau to adopt a pathological conformation, \nand this misfolding seeded further conformational changes in adjacent tau molecules  (Frost et\nal. ,  2008) .  Finally,  each syndrome we studied features sporadic and autosomal dominantly\ninherited forms.  For AD,  known susceptibility genes,  such as the Apo  4 allele,  increase risk\nor hasten disease onset.  Lifelong possession of a disease-causing mutation  (Geschwind et al. , \n2001)  or risk factor allele  (Reiman et al. ,  2004)  may destabilize network connectivity and\nfunction in young adulthood or even childhood  (Shaw et al. ,  2007) ,  setting the stage for mid-\nto late-life neurodegeneration.  These hypothetical network degeneration mechanisms need not\nbe considered mutually exclusive. \n\nSeveral recent studies suggest that,  in health,  functionally correlated brain regions feature\ndefined axonal connections  (Greicius et al. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2007;  Sporns et al. ,  2005) .  Our\nfindings demonstrate a less intuitive linkage,  revealing that healthy ICNs feature correlated\ngray matter volume.  This finding builds on existing notions of  small worldness  in human\ncortical gray matter structure  (He et al. ,  2007)  by demonstrating a direct,  network-based\nfunction-structure relationship.  Why gray matter function and volume correlate,  however, \nremains unclear.  During development,  network covariance may emerge  (Fair et al. ,  2008)  and\nremodel itself  (Kelly et al. ,  2008;  Lerch et al. ,  2006)  in response to core inherited projection\nmap formation scripts  (Ruthazer and Cline,  2004)  that interact with the environment to drive\nindividual differences in cognitive,  emotional,  and motor function  (Seeley et al. ,  2007) .  Use-\nrelated trophic effects,  in turn,  may continue to reshape the cortical mantle throughout\nadulthood  (Maguire et al. ,  2000) ,  linking synaptic strength,  synaptic density ,  and neuropil mass\nwithin functionally co-active regions. \n\nIn summary ,  neurodegenerative diseases are not diffuse,  random,  or confluent but instead target\nspecific large-scale distributed networks.  In the healthy brain,  these networks feature\nconvergent intrinsic functional and structural covariance.  To build more comprehensive\ndisease pathogenesis models,  neurodegeneration researchers should pursue the interface\nbetween disease protein aggregation and selective,  network-driven neuronal vulnerability. \n\nExperimental procedures\n\nSubjects\n\nAll subjects  (or their surrogates)  provided informed consent and the procedures were approved\nby the institutional review boards at UCSF and Stanford University. \n\nPatients:  Structural Imaging  Subjects for each patient group were selected from the\nUCSF Memory & Aging Center  (MAC)  database.  All had undergone a comprehensive\nneurological,  neuropsychological,  and functional assessment,  and final diagnoses were\nrendered at a multidisciplinary consensus conference,  as detailed previously  (Liu et al. , \n2004) .  To be considered for inclusion,  patients were required to meet published research\ncriteria,  which do not include neuroimaging features,  for probable AD  (McKhann et al. , \n1984) ,  bvFTD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  SD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  PNFA  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  or CBS\n (criteria developed at the MAC,  as previously described  (Boxer et al. ,  2006) )  within 90 days\nof MRI scanning.  In addition,  the following selection criteria were required:   (1)  CDR total\nscore < 1,  (2)  CDR and MMSE completed within 90 days of scanning,   (3)  absence of comorbid\nmotor neuron disease,  and  (4)  absence of significant vascular or other structural lesions on\n\nNeuron.

We chose to study only these five syndromes because they could be matched for age\nwhile preserving adequate sample size.  Although potentially relevant to our study aims, \npatients with the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome,  progressive supranuclear palsy , dementia\nwith Lewy bodies,  Huntington's disease,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  and multiple systems\natrophy were excluded to constrain the scope of the study and promote matching or because\ntoo few subjects with these diagnoses had available research MRI scans.  The three patient\ngroups with the most subjects meeting inclusion criteria were bvFTD  (n=24) ,  AD  (n= 49) ,  and\nSD  (n = 32) .  Therefore,  24 AD and 24 SD subjects were chosen from their larger pools to\nmatch the bvFTD group,  as closely as possible,  for age,  gender,  and education  (Table S1) . \nPNFA  (n = 13)  and CBS  (n =17)  groups were smaller than the others but still comparable to\npublished samples used to illustrate the syndromic regional atrophy patterns  (Boxer et al. , \n2006;  Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004;  Josephs et al. ,  2006) .  These syndromes are known to feature\nuneven gender distributions  (Johnson et al. ,  2005) ;  therefore,  in part because of our strict\ninclusion criteria  (e. g.  CDR < 1) ,  all groups could not be matched for gender.  Accordingly, \ngender was added as a nuisance covariate to the neuroimaging analyses. \n\nImportantly,  we made a sharp distinction between clinical syndromes and histopathological\nentities.  Therefore,  although the terms Alzheimer's disease and corticobasal degeneration are\nused by pathologists to describe specific histopathologies,  in this context we applied the terms\nAlzheimer's disease and corticobasal syndrome only to suggest clinical,  not pathological, \nfeatures.  This approach fits with our scientific objective,  which was to determine the\nrelationship between syndromic atrophy patterns and healthy human brain networks.  Our\noverarching hypothesis,  indeed,  was that large-scale cortical networks provide anatomical\nscaffoldings that are dismantled to produce clinically recognizable lesion-deficit constellations\n (syndromes) .  Applying network imaging to predict neuropathology was not a goal of this study; \nindeed,  most degenerative syndromes can be caused by several underlying pathologies,  and all\nneuropathological entities can give rise to diverse clinical syndromes. \n\nUCSF Controls:  Structural Imaging  Healthy controls  (HC)  were recruited for the\nstructural imaging and neuropsychological analyses from the San Francisco community.  These\ncontrols,  referred to from here forward as HC1,  underwent a comprehensive\nneuropsychological assessment and a neurological exam within 180 days of scanning.  HC1\nsubjects were required to have a CDR total score of 0, an MMSE of 28 or higher,  no significant\nhistory of neurological disease or structural pathology on MRI,  and a consensus diagnosis of\ncognitively normal;  101 subjects met these criteria.  This group was reduced to 65 subjects to\nmatch,  as closely as possible,  the overall patient group for age,  gender,  and education.  No\nUCSF control subject took neuropsychiatric medications except one,  who took buproprion 100\nmg daily for a remote history of depression. \n\nStanford Controls:  Functional Imaging  HC subjects for the functional imaging\nanalyses,  referred to henceforth as HC2,  were recruited from the UCSF Memory and Aging\ncenter  (as described above)  and from the Stanford Medical Center community.  The Stanford\nsubjects denied any significant neurologic or psychiatric history and were not taking\npsychoactive medications.  All had MMSE scores of 27/30 or higher. \n\nImage acquisition\n\nStructural Imaging  Structural MRI scans were obtained at UCSF on all patients and HC1\nsubjects.  Images were acquired on a 1. 5 Tesla Magneton VISION system  (Siemens Inc. . ,  Iselin, \nNJ)  using a standard quadrature head coil.  A volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient\necho  (MP-RAGE)  MRI  (TR/TE/inversion time = 10/4/300 msec)  sequence was used to obtain\naT 1-weighted image of the entire brain  (15 degree flip angle,  coronal orientation perpendicular\nto the double spin echo sequence,  1. 0x1. 0 mm? in-plane resolution of 1. 5 mm slab thickness) . \n\nNeuron.

Images were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE Signa Excite scanner\n (GE Medical Systems,  Milwaukee,  WI)  using a standard GE whole head coil.  Twenty-eight\naxial slices  (4 mm thick,  | mm skip)  parallel to the plane connecting the anterior and posterior\ncommissures and covering the whole brain were imaged using a T2* weighted gradient echo\nspiral pulse sequence  (repetition time,  2000 ms;  echo time,  30 ms;  flip angle,  80 degrees and\n1 interleave)   (Glover and Lai,  1998) .  The field of view was 200x200mm2,  and the matrix size\nwas 64x64,  yielding an in-plane spatial resolution of 3. 125 mm.  To reduce blurring and signal\nloss arising from field inhomogeneities,  an automated high-order shimming method based on\nspiral acquisitions was used before acquiring functional MRI scans  (Kim et al. ,  2000) .  All\nsubjects underwent two 6-minute task-free {MRI scans after being instructed only to remain\nawake with their eyes closed.  For two of 17 subjects,  one of the two runs was excluded due to\ntechnical factors. \n\nImage preprocessing and analysis\n\nStructural Imaging   Voxel-based morphometry  (VBM)  is a flexible whole brain statistical\nanalysis technique that can be used to assess between-group differences in local brain tissue\ncontent or correlations between tissue content and other measures of interest.  Before analysis, \nT1-weighted MR images underwent several preprocessing steps,  following an optimized VBM\nprotocol  (Good et al. ,  2001) .  First,  a study-specific template and priors were created to\nminimize spatial normalization and segmentation errors.  This approach helps to identify group\ndifferences in patients with neurodegenerative disease  (Senjem et al. ,  2005) .  All subjects were\nused to create the template,  and custom images for each subject were generated by applying\naffine and deformation parameters obtained from normalizing the grey matter images, \nsegmented in native space,  to the custom template.  Voxel values were modulated by\nmultiplying them by the jacobian determinants derived from the spatial normalization step, \nand images were smoothed with a 12-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo identify gray matter regions significantly atrophied in each syndrome vs.  HC1,  each group\nwas entered as a condition into a single model,  and linear contrasts were applied to derive five\nsyndromic atrophy maps.  From these maps,  we isolated the most significantly atrophied\ncortical region,  designated as the voxel with the peak t-score  (Table $2) .  We elected to use\nonly cortical seed ROIs because subcortical/limbic nuclei,  such as the caudate or amygdala, \nfeature a dense admixture of subnuclear projection fields and outputs with multi-network\nconnectivity.  Therefore,  after 4-mm fMRI data smoothing,  subcortical/limbic connectivity\nmaps become less straightforward to interpret than those derived using cortical seeds,  and we\nsought to treat all five network analyses similarly in this regard.  In addition,  VBM can\noverestimate periventricular volume loss due to atrophy-related spatial registration errors, even\nwith the optimized methods employed here  (Senjem et al. ,  2005) .  This concern further justifies\nexclusion of subcortical seeds for functional connectivity and structural covariance analyses. \nFor the SD map,  we chose the second most atrophied cortical region because the peak region\nfell within an area of susceptibility artifact on our T2* images  (Ojemann et al. ,  1997) . \nCollectively,  the syndromic peak voxels were used to create five 4-mm radius spherical ROIs\nusing MarsbaR v0. 41,  a region of interest toolbox for SPM  (Brett et al. ,  2002) .  These five\ncortical  seeds  were used in all subsequent structural and functional correlation analyses. \n\nStructural correlation analyses were applied only to the 65 HC1 subjects.  Adapting previous\napproaches by Mechelli and colleagues  (Mechelli et al. ,  2005) ,  we extracted each subject's\nmean grey matter intensity from the five seed ROIs.  These values were then entered into\nseparate covariate-only models to identify each voxel,  across the whole brain,  whose gray\nmatter intensity was significantly correlated with that of each seed across subjects. \n\nNeuron.

Preprocessing and analysis was implemented in\nthe SPMS software package  (www . fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/spm) .  For group contrast and correlation\nanalyses,  voxels were considered significant if they met statistical threshold of p < 0. 05, \ncorrected for family wise error  (FWE) . \n\nFunctional imaging  Functional images were realigned,  slice-time corrected,  normalized, \nand smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel.  Normalization was carried out by calculating the\nwarping parameters between the mean T2*  (spiral in/out)  image and the MNI EPI template\nand applying them to all images in the sequence.  Subsequently,  the images were resampled at\na voxel size of 2mm?. \n\nROIs derived from the five syndromic atrophy patterns were then used to seed five separate\nfunctional connectivity analyses,  following previous methods  (Seeley et al. ,  2007) .  That is, \nafter removing the first eight n frames to allow for stabilization of the magnetic field,  the\naverage time series from the first task-free scan was extracted from each ROI by averaging the\ntime series of all voxels within the ROI.  Before averaging individual voxel data,  scaling and\nfiltering steps were performed across all brain voxels as follows.  To minimize the effect of\nglobal drift,  voxel intensities were scaled by dividing the value of each time point by the mean\nvalue of the whole-brain image at that time point.  Next,  the scaled waveform of each brain\nvoxel was filtered using a bandpass filter  (0. 0083/s < f < 0. 15/s)  to reduce the effect of low\nfrequency drift and high-frequency noise  (Lowe et al. ,  1998) .  The scaling and filtering steps\nwere applied equivalently to all voxels  (including those in the ROIs) .  The resulting time series, \nrepresenting the average intensity  (after scaling and filtering)  of all voxels in the ROI,  was then\nused as a covariate of interest in a whole-brain,  linear regression,  statistical parametric analysis. \nAs a means of controlling for non-neural noise in the ROI time series,  we included,  as a nuisance\ncovariate,  the global average T2* time series.  Contrast images corresponding to the ROI time\nseries regressors were derived individually for each subject,  and entered into second-level, \nrandom-effects analyses  (joint height and extent thresholds of p <0. 001 for significant clusters, \ncorrected at the whole brain level)   (Poline et al. ,  1997)  to determine the brain areas that showed\nsignificant functional connectivity with each seed across HC2 subjects.  The resulting group\nmaps were used as spatial templates to select the best-fit independent component from each\nsubject in subsequent ICA analyses. \n\nWe used ICA to further refine our intrinsic functional connectivity maps  (Seeley et al. , \n2007) .  ICA decomposes a timecourse of whole brain volumes  (a 4-D image)  from a single\nsubject into independent spatiotemporal components.  After preprocessing,  images were\nconcatenated into 4-D files and entered into FSL 4. 0 Melodic ICA software\n (http: //www. fmrib. ox. ac. uk/fsl/index html) .  We allowed the program to automatically\ndetermine the dimensionality of each data set,  including the number of components.  Among\nthe 19 control subjects,  ICA extracted an average of 36. 7 components  (range 19-51)  from Run\n1 and 36. 5 components  (range 29-52)  from Run 2.  After high frequency filtering,  an average\nof 23. 2 components  (range 7-42)  remained from Run 1 and 20. 7 components  (range 12-42) \nremained for Run 2.  Temporal filtering was not applied to the ICA data because ICA has been\nshown to separate non-neural noise components from components of interest  (Beckmann et\nal. ,  2005) .  The components for each subject  (from Run | or 2)  that best fit the ROI-derived\ngroup ICN template maps were selected using an automated three step procedure  (Seeley et\nal. ,  2007) .  For two of nineteen subjects,  the algorithm selected the same component for two of\nthe five spatial templates.  For one of these subjects,  the right parietal  (AD)  and left inferior\nfrontal  (PNFA)  seed-based ROI maps were best fit by the same component,  and for the other\nsubject the right FI  (bvFTD)  and left inferior frontal  (PNFA)  seed maps best fit the same\ncomponent.  One-sample t-tests were performed on the best-fit component images to derive a\ngroup-level ICN map for each seed.  Significance was determined using joint expected\n\nNeuron.

The ICA-derived group\nmaps were used in all figures and spatial similarity analyses. \n\nSpatial similarity analyses  The spatial similarity between atrophy maps and their related\nICN and structural covariance maps was first quantified by measuring the GOF between each\natrophy map,  binarized at a p < 0. 05 family wise error  (FWE)  corrected threshold,  and the\ngroup-level ICA-derived ICNs and VBM-derived structural correlation maps.  GOF was\ndefined as the difference between the mean of the t-scores inside vs.  outside the binarized\natrophy map.  Therefore,  each group-level correlation map had five GOF scores:  one  source \nand four  other .  Here,   source  refers to the GOF score from the atrophy map used to derive\nthe correlation map's seed,  whereas  other  refers to the four other atrophy maps.  We further\ncompared each HC2 subject's five best-fit ICA components  (one for each seed ROD)  to the five\natrophy maps,  using the same GOF procedure.   Other  GOF scores were averaged for each\nsubject,  and paired samples t-tests were used to compare source vs.  mean other map GOF\nscores.  Finally,  to assess the specificity of each atrophy-ICN pairing at the single-subject level, \nwe calculated mean source map GOF score for the best-fit ICA components  (one each from\nRuns | and 2)  and compared these scores to the mean GOF for the 2\" best-fit components\n (Runs | and 2)  using paired samples t-tests  (two-tailed) .  Because structural covariance cannot\nbe derived for single subjects,  statistical comparisons of structural covariance GOF results were\nnot performed. \n\nTo visualize the spatial overlap within related atrophy,  functional connectivity,  and structural\ncovariance maps,  we loaded all three maps as overlays,  rendered at less stringent statistical\nthresholds  (atrophy:  p < 0. 0001,  uncorrected;  functional connectivity:  ICA maps at p < 0. 01\njoint height and extent thresholds,  corrected at the whole brain level;  structural covariance:  p\n< 0. 0001,  uncorrected) ,  and determined the intersection of the three maps,  defined as those\nvoxels contained in 3/3 maps at these thresholds.  This procedure allowed us to demonstrate\nthe convergence of the three maps within each set,  as well as the spatial dissimilarity between\nthe five separate 3-map sets  (Figure 6) . \n\nSupplementary Material\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank M.

        "Methods": "atrophy within five distinct healthy human intrinsic functional connectivity networks.  We further\ndiscovered a direct link between intrinsic connectivity and gray matter structure.  Across healthy\nindividuals,  nodes within each functional network exhibited tightly correlated gray matter volumes.\ndisease-vulnerable foci,  applying the same seed ROIs  (Figure 2A,  Table S2)  used to probe our\nintrinsic functional connectivity data.  Local ROI mean gray matter intensities extracted from\nthe five seeds provided covariates for five separate whole brain statistical parametric regression\nanalyses in which age and gender were entered as nuisance covariates.  These studies revealed\nstriking convergence between healthy intrinsic functional connectivity,  derived within subjects\n (Figures 2B,  3B,  4A-B) ,  and structural covariance,  assessed across subjects  (Figures 2C,  3C, \n4C-D) .  As a result,  our three data streams converged  (Figures 5-6) .  That is,  normal ICN and\nstructural covariance patterns mirrored each other and reflected,  with high fidelity,  those\nregions that co-degenerate in distinct human neurodegenerative syndromes.  BVFTD was\nchosen to highlight convergence of the three maps in greater detail  (Figure 3) .  ROI functional\ntimeseries from a representative control subject  (Figure 4A-B)  and related group-level\nstructural correlation plots  (Figure 4C-D)  further illustrate the brain's shared functional-\nstructural covariance architecture. \n\nDisease-vulnerable networks are dissociable:  spatial similarity and overlap analyses\n\nTo quantify the spatial similarity between each atrophy pattern and the healthy functional-\nstructural covariance networks,  we used the ten control group correlation maps  (5 functional, \n5 structural)  to generate goodness-of-fit  (GOF)  scores to each syndromic atrophy map.

These analyses indicated a strong fit between the intrinsic functional\nand structural covariance maps and their  source  atrophy patterns  (Figure SA,  C) .  Although\nonly a small,  single ROI from each source map  (Figure 2A)  was used to seed the ICN and\nstructural covariance analyses,  the resulting healthy networks fit better with their source\natrophy maps than with the other four disease patterns.\n(Vincent et al. ,  2007) .  ICNs frequently reported  (Beckmann et al. ,  2005;  Damoiseaux et al. , \n2006;  De Luca et al. ,  2006;  van den Heuvel et al. ,  2008)  but not studied here include primary\nand secondary visual networks that may provide substrate for the visual-spatial variant of AD\nknown as the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome  (Hof et al. ,  1997) ,  a primary sensorimotor\nICN that may relate to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (Kassubek et al. ,  2005) ,  and a lateral\nfrontoparietal executive-control network  (Seeley et al. ,  2007;  Vincent et al. ,  2008)  that falters\nin most neurodegenerative diseases as degeneration spreads beyond the sites of initial injury\ninto widely interconnected supervisory neocortical systems. \n\nConfirmation of the network degeneration hypothesis raises important questions about how\nspecific syndromes will impact ICN strength.  Previous studies suggest that AD attenuates\nconnectivity within the right ANG  ( default mode )  network  (Greicius et al. ,  2004;  Supekar\net al. ,  2008) ,  even during early clinical stages  (Sorg et al. ,  2007) .  Task-based episodic memory\nfMRI studies,  in contrast,  suggest heightened hippocampal activation during prodromal AD\n (Dickerson et al. ,  2004) ,  and an AD intrinsic connectivity study revealed focal frontal\nconnectivity enhancements  (Supekar et al. ,  2008) .  For the non-AD dementia syndromes,  no\npublished ICN data are available.  Therefore,  it remains uncertain whether disease causes\nnetwork connectivity impairment,  upregulation,  or effects that vary by disease stage.  This issue\nrequires clarification before network connectivity approaches can be used to diagnose dementia\nor track its progression.  Those patients who scale up connectivity within early-affected\nnetworks or unaffected compensatory systems may prove more resilient to functional decline. \nEven more intriguingly,  patients with focal connectivity enhancements may develop new or\nintensified functional capabilities  (Seeley et al. ,  2008b) . \n\nWhy does neurodegeneration spread throughout specific neural networks? The present study\nwas designed to raise rather than answer this question,  but several mechanisms may apply. \nFirst,  selective neuronal vulnerability within key synaptic convergence zones may disconnect\nor weaken functional circuits  (Hyman et al. ,  1984) ,  inducing deleterious network-wide\ncompensatory strategies.  This notion fits with AD transgenic mouse models,  in which aberrant\nmedial temporal circuit excitability disrupts homeostasis and function,  leading to progressive\ndegeneration within the circuit  (Palop et al. , 2006;  Palop et al. , 2007) .  Second,  retrograde axonal\ntransport deficits may cut off growth factor supply to long-range projection neurons,  begetting\naxonal degeneration,  synapse loss,  and post-synaptic dendrite retraction  (Salehi et al. ,  2006) . \n\nNeuron.

This account of our data would require that non-prion\nmisfolded disease proteins could trigger misfolding of adjacent same-species proteins,  which, \nin turn,  could cascade down processes and between interconnected neurons.  Although many\naspects of this candidate mechanism remain unexplored,  in a recent study pathological tau\nconformers were shown to induce native  (unfolded)  tau to adopt a pathological conformation, \nand this misfolding seeded further conformational changes in adjacent tau molecules  (Frost et\nal. ,  2008) .  Finally,  each syndrome we studied features sporadic and autosomal dominantly\ninherited forms.  For AD,  known susceptibility genes,  such as the Apo  4 allele,  increase risk\nor hasten disease onset.  Lifelong possession of a disease-causing mutation  (Geschwind et al. , \n2001)  or risk factor allele  (Reiman et al. ,  2004)  may destabilize network connectivity and\nfunction in young adulthood or even childhood  (Shaw et al. ,  2007) ,  setting the stage for mid-\nto late-life neurodegeneration.  These hypothetical network degeneration mechanisms need not\nbe considered mutually exclusive. \n\nSeveral recent studies suggest that,  in health,  functionally correlated brain regions feature\ndefined axonal connections  (Greicius et al. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2007;  Sporns et al. ,  2005) .  Our\nAll subjects  (or their surrogates)  provided informed consent and the procedures were approved\nby the institutional review boards at UCSF and Stanford University. \n\nPatients:  Structural Imaging  Subjects for each patient group were selected from the\nUCSF Memory & Aging Center  (MAC)  database.  All had undergone a comprehensive\nneurological,  neuropsychological,  and functional assessment,  and final diagnoses were\nrendered at a multidisciplinary consensus conference,  as detailed previously  (Liu et al. , \n2004) .  To be considered for inclusion,  patients were required to meet published research\ncriteria,  which do not include neuroimaging features,  for probable AD  (McKhann et al. , \n1984) ,  bvFTD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  SD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  PNFA  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  or CBS\n (criteria developed at the MAC,  as previously described  (Boxer et al. ,  2006) )  within 90 days\nof MRI scanning.  In addition,  the following selection criteria were required:   (1)  CDR total\nscore < 1,  (2)  CDR and MMSE completed within 90 days of scanning,   (3)  absence of comorbid\nmotor neuron disease,  and  (4)  absence of significant vascular or other structural lesions on\n\nNeuron.

We chose to study only these five syndromes because they could be matched for age\nwhile preserving adequate sample size.  Although potentially relevant to our study aims, \npatients with the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome,  progressive supranuclear palsy , dementia\nwith Lewy bodies,  Huntington's disease,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  and multiple systems\natrophy were excluded to constrain the scope of the study and promote matching or because\ntoo few subjects with these diagnoses had available research MRI scans.  The three patient\ngroups with the most subjects meeting inclusion criteria were bvFTD  (n=24) ,  AD  (n= 49) ,  and\nSD  (n = 32) .  Therefore,  24 AD and 24 SD subjects were chosen from their larger pools to\nmatch the bvFTD group,  as closely as possible,  for age,  gender,  and education  (Table S1) . \nPNFA  (n = 13)  and CBS  (n =17)  groups were smaller than the others but still comparable to\npublished samples used to illustrate the syndromic regional atrophy patterns  (Boxer et al. , \n2006;  Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004;  Josephs et al. ,  2006) .  These syndromes are known to feature\nuneven gender distributions  (Johnson et al. ,  2005) ;  therefore,  in part because of our strict\ninclusion criteria  (e. g.  CDR < 1) ,  all groups could not be matched for gender.  Accordingly, \ngender was added as a nuisance covariate to the neuroimaging analyses. \n\nImportantly,  we made a sharp distinction between clinical syndromes and histopathological\nentities.  Therefore,  although the terms Alzheimer's disease and corticobasal degeneration are\nused by pathologists to describe specific histopathologies,  in this context we applied the terms\nAlzheimer's disease and corticobasal syndrome only to suggest clinical,  not pathological, \nfeatures.  This approach fits with our scientific objective,  which was to determine the\nrelationship between syndromic atrophy patterns and healthy human brain networks.  Our\noverarching hypothesis,  indeed,  was that large-scale cortical networks provide anatomical\nscaffoldings that are dismantled to produce clinically recognizable lesion-deficit constellations\n (syndromes) .  Applying network imaging to predict neuropathology was not a goal of this study; \nindeed,  most degenerative syndromes can be caused by several underlying pathologies,  and all\nneuropathological entities can give rise to diverse clinical syndromes. \n\nUCSF Controls:  Structural Imaging  Healthy controls  (HC)  were recruited for the\nstructural imaging and neuropsychological analyses from the San Francisco community.  These\ncontrols,  referred to from here forward as HC1,  underwent a comprehensive\nneuropsychological assessment and a neurological exam within 180 days of scanning.  HC1\nsubjects were required to have a CDR total score of 0, an MMSE of 28 or higher,  no significant\nhistory of neurological disease or structural pathology on MRI,  and a consensus diagnosis of\ncognitively normal;  101 subjects met these criteria.  This group was reduced to 65 subjects to\nmatch,  as closely as possible,  the overall patient group for age,  gender,  and education.  No\nUCSF control subject took neuropsychiatric medications except one,  who took buproprion 100\nmg daily for a remote history of depression. \n\nStanford Controls:  Functional Imaging  HC subjects for the functional imaging\nanalyses,  referred to henceforth as HC2,  were recruited from the UCSF Memory and Aging\ncenter  (as described above)  and from the Stanford Medical Center community.  The Stanford\nsubjects denied any significant neurologic or psychiatric history and were not taking\npsychoactive medications.  All had MMSE scores of 27/30 or higher. \n\nImage acquisition\n\nStructural Imaging  Structural MRI scans were obtained at UCSF on all patients and HC1\nsubjects.  Images were acquired on a 1. 5 Tesla Magneton VISION system  (Siemens Inc. . ,  Iselin, \nNJ)  using a standard quadrature head coil.  A volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient\necho  (MP-RAGE)  MRI  (TR/TE/inversion time = 10/4/300 msec)  sequence was used to obtain\naT 1-weighted image of the entire brain  (15 degree flip angle,  coronal orientation perpendicular\nto the double spin echo sequence,  1. 0x1. 0 mm? in-plane resolution of 1. 5 mm slab thickness) . \n\nNeuron.

Images were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE Signa Excite scanner\n (GE Medical Systems,  Milwaukee,  WI)  using a standard GE whole head coil.  Twenty-eight\naxial slices  (4 mm thick,  | mm skip)  parallel to the plane connecting the anterior and posterior\ncommissures and covering the whole brain were imaged using a T2* weighted gradient echo\nspiral pulse sequence  (repetition time,  2000 ms;  echo time,  30 ms;  flip angle,  80 degrees and\n1 interleave)   (Glover and Lai,  1998) .  The field of view was 200x200mm2,  and the matrix size\nwas 64x64,  yielding an in-plane spatial resolution of 3. 125 mm.  To reduce blurring and signal\nloss arising from field inhomogeneities,  an automated high-order shimming method based on\nspiral acquisitions was used before acquiring functional MRI scans  (Kim et al. ,  2000) .  All\nsubjects underwent two 6-minute task-free {MRI scans after being instructed only to remain\nawake with their eyes closed.  For two of 17 subjects,  one of the two runs was excluded due to\ntechnical factors. \n\nImage preprocessing and analysis\n\nStructural Imaging   Voxel-based morphometry  (VBM)  is a flexible whole brain statistical\nanalysis technique that can be used to assess between-group differences in local brain tissue\ncontent or correlations between tissue content and other measures of interest.  Before analysis, \nT1-weighted MR images underwent several preprocessing steps,  following an optimized VBM\nprotocol  (Good et al. ,  2001) .  First,  a study-specific template and priors were created to\nminimize spatial normalization and segmentation errors.  This approach helps to identify group\ndifferences in patients with neurodegenerative disease  (Senjem et al. ,  2005) .  All subjects were\nused to create the template,  and custom images for each subject were generated by applying\naffine and deformation parameters obtained from normalizing the grey matter images, \nsegmented in native space,  to the custom template.  Voxel values were modulated by\nmultiplying them by the jacobian determinants derived from the spatial normalization step, \nand images were smoothed with a 12-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo identify gray matter regions significantly atrophied in each syndrome vs.  HC1,  each group\nwas entered as a condition into a single model,  and linear contrasts were applied to derive five\nsyndromic atrophy maps.  From these maps,  we isolated the most significantly atrophied\ncortical region,  designated as the voxel with the peak t-score  (Table $2) .  We elected to use\nonly cortical seed ROIs because subcortical/limbic nuclei,  such as the caudate or amygdala, \nfeature a dense admixture of subnuclear projection fields and outputs with multi-network\nconnectivity.  Therefore,  after 4-mm fMRI data smoothing,  subcortical/limbic connectivity\nmaps become less straightforward to interpret than those derived using cortical seeds,  and we\nsought to treat all five network analyses similarly in this regard.  In addition,  VBM can\noverestimate periventricular volume loss due to atrophy-related spatial registration errors, even\nexclusion of subcortical seeds for functional connectivity and structural covariance analyses. \nFor the SD map,  we chose the second most atrophied cortical region because the peak region\nfell within an area of susceptibility artifact on our T2* images  (Ojemann et al. ,  1997) . \nCollectively,  the syndromic peak voxels were used to create five 4-mm radius spherical ROIs\nusing MarsbaR v0. 41,  a region of interest toolbox for SPM  (Brett et al. ,  2002) .  These five\ncortical  seeds  were used in all subsequent structural and functional correlation analyses. \n\nStructural correlation analyses were applied only to the 65 HC1 subjects.  Adapting previous\napproaches by Mechelli and colleagues  (Mechelli et al. ,  2005) ,  we extracted each subject's\nmean grey matter intensity from the five seed ROIs.  These values were then entered into\nseparate covariate-only models to identify each voxel,  across the whole brain,  whose gray\nmatter intensity was significantly correlated with that of each seed across subjects. \n\nNeuron.

Preprocessing and analysis was implemented in\nthe SPMS software package  (www . fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/spm) .  For group contrast and correlation\nanalyses,  voxels were considered significant if they met statistical threshold of p < 0. 05, \ncorrected for family wise error  (FWE) . \n\nFunctional imaging  Functional images were realigned,  slice-time corrected,  normalized, \nand smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel.  Normalization was carried out by calculating the\nwarping parameters between the mean T2*  (spiral in/out)  image and the MNI EPI template\nand applying them to all images in the sequence.  Subsequently,  the images were resampled at\na voxel size of 2mm?. \n\nROIs derived from the five syndromic atrophy patterns were then used to seed five separate\nafter removing the first eight n frames to allow for stabilization of the magnetic field,  the\naverage time series from the first task-free scan was extracted from each ROI by averaging the\ntime series of all voxels within the ROI.  Before averaging individual voxel data,  scaling and\nfiltering steps were performed across all brain voxels as follows.  To minimize the effect of\nglobal drift,  voxel intensities were scaled by dividing the value of each time point by the mean\nvalue of the whole-brain image at that time point.  Next,  the scaled waveform of each brain\nvoxel was filtered using a bandpass filter  (0. 0083/s < f < 0. 15/s)  to reduce the effect of low\nfrequency drift and high-frequency noise  (Lowe et al. ,  1998) .  The scaling and filtering steps\nwere applied equivalently to all voxels  (including those in the ROIs) .  The resulting time series, \nrepresenting the average intensity  (after scaling and filtering)  of all voxels in the ROI,  was then\nused as a covariate of interest in a whole-brain,  linear regression,  statistical parametric analysis. \nAs a means of controlling for non-neural noise in the ROI time series,  we included,  as a nuisance\ncovariate,  the global average T2* time series.  Contrast images corresponding to the ROI time\nseries regressors were derived individually for each subject,  and entered into second-level, \nrandom-effects analyses  (joint height and extent thresholds of p <0. 001 for significant clusters, \ncorrected at the whole brain level)   (Poline et al. ,  1997)  to determine the brain areas that showed\nsignificant functional connectivity with each seed across HC2 subjects.  The resulting group\nmaps were used as spatial templates to select the best-fit independent component from each\nsubject in subsequent ICA analyses. \n\nWe used ICA to further refine our intrinsic functional connectivity maps  (Seeley et al. , \n2007) .  ICA decomposes a timecourse of whole brain volumes  (a 4-D image)  from a single\nsubject into independent spatiotemporal components.  After preprocessing,  images were\nconcatenated into 4-D files and entered into FSL 4. 0 Melodic ICA software\n (http: //www. fmrib. ox. ac. uk/fsl/index html) .  We allowed the program to automatically\ndetermine the dimensionality of each data set,  including the number of components.  Among\nthe 19 control subjects,  ICA extracted an average of 36. 7 components  (range 19-51)  from Run\n1 and 36. 5 components  (range 29-52)  from Run 2.  After high frequency filtering,  an average\nof 23. 2 components  (range 7-42)  remained from Run 1 and 20. 7 components  (range 12-42) \nremained for Run 2.  Temporal filtering was not applied to the ICA data because ICA has been\nshown to separate non-neural noise components from components of interest  (Beckmann et\nal. ,  2005) .  The components for each subject  (from Run | or 2)  that best fit the ROI-derived\ngroup ICN template maps were selected using an automated three step procedure  (Seeley et\nal. ,  2007) .  For two of nineteen subjects,  the algorithm selected the same component for two of\nthe five spatial templates.  For one of these subjects,  the right parietal  (AD)  and left inferior\nfrontal  (PNFA)  seed-based ROI maps were best fit by the same component,  and for the other\nsubject the right FI  (bvFTD)  and left inferior frontal  (PNFA)  seed maps best fit the same\ncomponent.  One-sample t-tests were performed on the best-fit component images to derive a\ngroup-level ICN map for each seed.  Significance was determined using joint expected\n\nNeuron.

The ICA-derived group\nmaps were used in all figures and spatial similarity analyses. \n\nSpatial similarity analyses  The spatial similarity between atrophy maps and their related\nICN and structural covariance maps was first quantified by measuring the GOF between each\natrophy map,  binarized at a p < 0. 05 family wise error  (FWE)  corrected threshold,  and the\ngroup-level ICA-derived ICNs and VBM-derived structural correlation maps.  GOF was\ndefined as the difference between the mean of the t-scores inside vs.  outside the binarized\natrophy map.  Therefore,  each group-level correlation map had five GOF scores:  one  source \nand four  other .  Here,   source  refers to the GOF score from the atrophy map used to derive\nthe correlation map's seed,  whereas  other  refers to the four other atrophy maps.  We further\ncompared each HC2 subject's five best-fit ICA components  (one for each seed ROD)  to the five\natrophy maps,  using the same GOF procedure.   Other  GOF scores were averaged for each\nsubject,  and paired samples t-tests were used to compare source vs.  mean other map GOF\nscores.  Finally,  to assess the specificity of each atrophy-ICN pairing at the single-subject level, \nwe calculated mean source map GOF score for the best-fit ICA components  (one each from\nRuns | and 2)  and compared these scores to the mean GOF for the 2\" best-fit components\n (Runs | and 2)  using paired samples t-tests  (two-tailed) .

Task-based episodic memory\nfMRI studies,  in contrast,  suggest heightened hippocampal activation during prodromal AD\n (Dickerson et al. ,  2004) ,  and an AD intrinsic connectivity study revealed focal frontal\nconnectivity enhancements  (Supekar et al. ,  2008) .  For the non-AD dementia syndromes,  no\npublished ICN data are available.  Therefore,  it remains uncertain whether disease causes\nnetwork connectivity impairment,  upregulation,  or effects that vary by disease stage.  This issue\nrequires clarification before network connectivity approaches can be used to diagnose dementia\nor track its progression.  Those patients who scale up connectivity within early-affected\nnetworks or unaffected compensatory systems may prove more resilient to functional decline. \nEven more intriguingly,  patients with focal connectivity enhancements may develop new or\nintensified functional capabilities  (Seeley et al. ,  2008b) . \n\nWhy does neurodegeneration spread throughout specific neural networks? The present study\nwas designed to raise rather than answer this question,  but several mechanisms may apply. \nFirst,  selective neuronal vulnerability within key synaptic convergence zones may disconnect\nor weaken functional circuits  (Hyman et al. ,  1984) ,  inducing deleterious network-wide\ncompensatory strategies.  This notion fits with AD transgenic mouse models,  in which aberrant\nmedial temporal circuit excitability disrupts homeostasis and function,  leading to progressive\ndegeneration within the circuit  (Palop et al. , 2006;  Palop et al. , 2007) .  Second,  retrograde axonal\ntransport deficits may cut off growth factor supply to long-range projection neurons,  begetting\naxonal degeneration,  synapse loss,  and post-synaptic dendrite retraction  (Salehi et al. ,  2006) . \n\nNeuron.  Author manuscript;  available in PMC 2010 April 16. \nyduosnuey JouINY Wd-HIN yduosnuew JouINY Wd-HIN\n\nyduosnuew JouNY Vd-HIN\n\nSeeley et al. \n\nPage 6\n\nThird,  as seen in experimental prion disease,  misfolded disease proteins may themselves\npropagate along neural processes,  marching throughout local and then long-range circuits via\ntranssynaptic spread  (Scott et al. ,  1992) .  This account of our data would require that non-prion\nmisfolded disease proteins could trigger misfolding of adjacent same-species proteins,  which, \nin turn,  could cascade down processes and between interconnected neurons.  Although many\naspects of this candidate mechanism remain unexplored,  in a recent study pathological tau\nconformers were shown to induce native  (unfolded)  tau to adopt a pathological conformation, \nand this misfolding seeded further conformational changes in adjacent tau molecules  (Frost et\nal. ,  2008) .  Finally,  each syndrome we studied features sporadic and autosomal dominantly\ninherited forms.  For AD,  known susceptibility genes,  such as the Apo  4 allele,  increase risk\nor hasten disease onset.  Lifelong possession of a disease-causing mutation  (Geschwind et al. , \n2001)  or risk factor allele  (Reiman et al. ,  2004)  may destabilize network connectivity and\nfunction in young adulthood or even childhood  (Shaw et al. ,  2007) ,  setting the stage for mid-\nto late-life neurodegeneration.  These hypothetical network degeneration mechanisms need not\nbe considered mutually exclusive. \n\nSeveral recent studies suggest that,  in health,  functionally correlated brain regions feature\ndefined axonal connections  (Greicius et al. ,  2008;  Seeley et al. ,  2007;  Sporns et al. ,  2005) .  Our\nexclusion of subcortical seeds for functional connectivity and structural covariance analyses. \nFor the SD map,  we chose the second most atrophied cortical region because the peak region\nfell within an area of susceptibility artifact on our T2* images  (Ojemann et al. ,  1997) . \nCollectively,  the syndromic peak voxels were used to create five 4-mm radius spherical ROIs\nusing MarsbaR v0. 41,  a region of interest toolbox for SPM  (Brett et al. ,  2002) .  These five\ncortical  seeds  were used in all subsequent structural and functional correlation analyses. \n\nStructural correlation analyses were applied only to the 65 HC1 subjects.  Adapting previous\napproaches by Mechelli and colleagues  (Mechelli et al. ,  2005) ,  we extracted each subject's\nmean grey matter intensity from the five seed ROIs.  These values were then entered into\nseparate covariate-only models to identify each voxel,  across the whole brain,  whose gray\nmatter intensity was significantly correlated with that of each seed across subjects. \n\nNeuron.

Preprocessing and analysis was implemented in\nthe SPMS software package  (www . fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/spm) .  For group contrast and correlation\nanalyses,  voxels were considered significant if they met statistical threshold of p < 0. 05, \ncorrected for family wise error  (FWE) . \n\nFunctional imaging  Functional images were realigned,  slice-time corrected,  normalized, \nand smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel.  Normalization was carried out by calculating the\nwarping parameters between the mean T2*  (spiral in/out)  image and the MNI EPI template\nand applying them to all images in the sequence.  Subsequently,  the images were resampled at\na voxel size of 2mm?. \n\nROIs derived from the five syndromic atrophy patterns were then used to seed five separate\nafter removing the first eight n frames to allow for stabilization of the magnetic field,  the\naverage time series from the first task-free scan was extracted from each ROI by averaging the\ntime series of all voxels within the ROI.  Before averaging individual voxel data,  scaling and\nfiltering steps were performed across all brain voxels as follows.  To minimize the effect of\nglobal drift,  voxel intensities were scaled by dividing the value of each time point by the mean\nvalue of the whole-brain image at that time point.  Next,  the scaled waveform of each brain\nvoxel was filtered using a bandpass filter  (0. 0083/s < f < 0. 15/s)  to reduce the effect of low\nfrequency drift and high-frequency noise  (Lowe et al. ,  1998) .  The scaling and filtering steps\nwere applied equivalently to all voxels  (including those in the ROIs) .  The resulting time series, \nrepresenting the average intensity  (after scaling and filtering)  of all voxels in the ROI,  was then\nused as a covariate of interest in a whole-brain,  linear regression,  statistical parametric analysis. \nAs a means of controlling for non-neural noise in the ROI time series,  we included,  as a nuisance\ncovariate,  the global average T2* time series.  Contrast images corresponding to the ROI time\nseries regressors were derived individually for each subject,  and entered into second-level, \nrandom-effects analyses  (joint height and extent thresholds of p <0. 001 for significant clusters, \ncorrected at the whole brain level)   (Poline et al. ,  1997)  to determine the brain areas that showed\nsignificant functional connectivity with each seed across HC2 subjects.  The resulting group\nmaps were used as spatial templates to select the best-fit independent component from each\nsubject in subsequent ICA analyses. \n\nWe used ICA to further refine our intrinsic functional connectivity maps  (Seeley et al. , \n2007) .  ICA decomposes a timecourse of whole brain volumes  (a 4-D image)  from a single\nsubject into independent spatiotemporal components.  After preprocessing,  images were\nconcatenated into 4-D files and entered into FSL 4. 0 Melodic ICA software\n (http: //www. fmrib. ox. ac. uk/fsl/index html) .  We allowed the program to automatically\ndetermine the dimensionality of each data set,  including the number of components.  Among\nthe 19 control subjects,  ICA extracted an average of 36. 7 components  (range 19-51)  from Run\n1 and 36. 5 components  (range 29-52)  from Run 2.  After high frequency filtering,  an average\nof 23. 2 components  (range 7-42)  remained from Run 1 and 20. 7 components  (range 12-42) \nremained for Run 2.  Temporal filtering was not applied to the ICA data because ICA has been\nshown to separate non-neural noise components from components of interest  (Beckmann et\nal. ,  2005) .  The components for each subject  (from Run | or 2)  that best fit the ROI-derived\ngroup ICN template maps were selected using an automated three step procedure  (Seeley et\nal. ,  2007) .  For two of nineteen subjects,  the algorithm selected the same component for two of\nthe five spatial templates.  For one of these subjects,  the right parietal  (AD)  and left inferior\nfrontal  (PNFA)  seed-based ROI maps were best fit by the same component,  and for the other\nsubject the right FI  (bvFTD)  and left inferior frontal  (PNFA)  seed maps best fit the same\ncomponent.  One-sample t-tests were performed on the best-fit component images to derive a\ngroup-level ICN map for each seed.  Significance was determined using joint expected\n\nNeuron.

The ICA-derived group\nmaps were used in all figures and spatial similarity analyses. \n\nSpatial similarity analyses  The spatial similarity between atrophy maps and their related\nICN and structural covariance maps was first quantified by measuring the GOF between each\natrophy map,  binarized at a p < 0. 05 family wise error  (FWE)  corrected threshold,  and the\ngroup-level ICA-derived ICNs and VBM-derived structural correlation maps.  GOF was\ndefined as the difference between the mean of the t-scores inside vs.  outside the binarized\natrophy map.  Therefore,  each group-level correlation map had five GOF scores:  one  source \nand four  other .  Here,   source  refers to the GOF score from the atrophy map used to derive\nthe correlation map's seed,  whereas  other  refers to the four other atrophy maps.  We further\ncompared each HC2 subject's five best-fit ICA components  (one for each seed ROD)  to the five\natrophy maps,  using the same GOF procedure.   Other  GOF scores were averaged for each\nsubject,  and paired samples t-tests were used to compare source vs.  mean other map GOF\nscores.  Finally,  to assess the specificity of each atrophy-ICN pairing at the single-subject level, \nwe calculated mean source map GOF score for the best-fit ICA components  (one each from\nRuns | and 2)  and compared these scores to the mean GOF for the 2\" best-fit components\n (Runs | and 2)  using paired samples t-tests  (two-tailed) .

All had undergone a comprehensive\nneurological,  neuropsychological,  and functional assessment,  and final diagnoses were\nrendered at a multidisciplinary consensus conference,  as detailed previously  (Liu et al. , \n2004) .  To be considered for inclusion,  patients were required to meet published research\ncriteria,  which do not include neuroimaging features,  for probable AD  (McKhann et al. , \n1984) ,  bvFTD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  SD  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  PNFA  (Neary et al. ,  1998) ,  or CBS\n (criteria developed at the MAC,  as previously described  (Boxer et al. ,  2006) )  within 90 days\nof MRI scanning.

We chose to study only these five syndromes because they could be matched for age\nwhile preserving adequate sample size.  Although potentially relevant to our study aims, \npatients with the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome,  progressive supranuclear palsy , dementia\nwith Lewy bodies,  Huntington's disease,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  and multiple systems\natrophy were excluded to constrain the scope of the study and promote matching or because\ntoo few subjects with these diagnoses had available research MRI scans.  The three patient\ngroups with the most subjects meeting inclusion criteria were bvFTD  (n=24) ,  AD  (n= 49) ,  and\nSD  (n = 32) .  Therefore,  24 AD and 24 SD subjects were chosen from their larger pools to\nmatch the bvFTD group,  as closely as possible,  for age,  gender,  and education  (Table S1) . \nPNFA  (n = 13)  and CBS  (n =17)  groups were smaller than the others but still comparable to\npublished samples used to illustrate the syndromic regional atrophy patterns  (Boxer et al. , \n2006;  Gorno-Tempini et al. ,  2004;  Josephs et al. ,  2006) .  These syndromes are known to feature\nuneven gender distributions  (Johnson et al. ,  2005) ;  therefore,  in part because of our strict\ninclusion criteria  (e. g.  CDR < 1) ,  all groups could not be matched for gender.  Accordingly, \ngender was added as a nuisance covariate to the neuroimaging analyses. \n\nImportantly,  we made a sharp distinction between clinical syndromes and histopathological\nentities.  Therefore,  although the terms Alzheimer's disease and corticobasal degeneration are\nused by pathologists to describe specific histopathologies,  in this context we applied the terms\nAlzheimer's disease and corticobasal syndrome only to suggest clinical,  not pathological, \nfeatures.  This approach fits with our scientific objective,  which was to determine the\nrelationship between syndromic atrophy patterns and healthy human brain networks.  Our\noverarching hypothesis,  indeed,  was that large-scale cortical networks provide anatomical\nscaffoldings that are dismantled to produce clinically recognizable lesion-deficit constellations\n (syndromes) .  Applying network imaging to predict neuropathology was not a goal of this study; \nindeed,  most degenerative syndromes can be caused by several underlying pathologies,  and all\nneuropathological entities can give rise to diverse clinical syndromes. \n\nUCSF Controls:  Structural Imaging  Healthy controls  (HC)  were recruited for the\nstructural imaging and neuropsychological analyses from the San Francisco community.  These\ncontrols,  referred to from here forward as HC1,  underwent a comprehensive\nneuropsychological assessment and a neurological exam within 180 days of scanning.  HC1\nsubjects were required to have a CDR total score of 0, an MMSE of 28 or higher,  no significant\nhistory of neurological disease or structural pathology on MRI,  and a consensus diagnosis of\ncognitively normal;  101 subjects met these criteria.  This group was reduced to 65 subjects to\nmatch,  as closely as possible,  the overall patient group for age,  gender,  and education.  No\nUCSF control subject took neuropsychiatric medications except one,  who took buproprion 100\nmg daily for a remote history of depression. \n\nStanford Controls:  Functional Imaging  HC subjects for the functional imaging\nanalyses,  referred to henceforth as HC2,  were recruited from the UCSF Memory and Aging\ncenter  (as described above)  and from the Stanford Medical Center community.  The Stanford\nsubjects denied any significant neurologic or psychiatric history and were not taking\npsychoactive medications.  All had MMSE scores of 27/30 or higher. \n\nImage acquisition\n\nStructural Imaging  Structural MRI scans were obtained at UCSF on all patients and HC1\nsubjects.  Images were acquired on a 1. 5 Tesla Magneton VISION system  (Siemens Inc. . ,  Iselin, \nNJ)  using a standard quadrature head coil.  A volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient\necho  (MP-RAGE)  MRI  (TR/TE/inversion time = 10/4/300 msec)  sequence was used to obtain\naT 1-weighted image of the entire brain  (15 degree flip angle,  coronal orientation perpendicular\nto the double spin echo sequence,  1. 0x1. 0 mm? in-plane resolution of 1. 5 mm slab thickness) . \n\nNeuron.

Images were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE Signa Excite scanner\n (GE Medical Systems,  Milwaukee,  WI)  using a standard GE whole head coil.  Twenty-eight\naxial slices  (4 mm thick,  | mm skip)  parallel to the plane connecting the anterior and posterior\ncommissures and covering the whole brain were imaged using a T2* weighted gradient echo\nspiral pulse sequence  (repetition time,  2000 ms;  echo time,  30 ms;  flip angle,  80 degrees and\n1 interleave)   (Glover and Lai,  1998) .  The field of view was 200x200mm2,  and the matrix size\nwas 64x64,  yielding an in-plane spatial resolution of 3. 125 mm.  To reduce blurring and signal\nloss arising from field inhomogeneities,  an automated high-order shimming method based on\nspiral acquisitions was used before acquiring functional MRI scans  (Kim et al. ,  2000) .  All\nsubjects underwent two 6-minute task-free {MRI scans after being instructed only to remain\nawake with their eyes closed.  For two of 17 subjects,  one of the two runs was excluded due to\ntechnical factors. \n\nImage preprocessing and analysis\n\nStructural Imaging   Voxel-based morphometry  (VBM)  is a flexible whole brain statistical\nanalysis technique that can be used to assess between-group differences in local brain tissue\ncontent or correlations between tissue content and other measures of interest.  Before analysis, \nT1-weighted MR images underwent several preprocessing steps,  following an optimized VBM\nprotocol  (Good et al. ,  2001) .  First,  a study-specific template and priors were created to\nminimize spatial normalization and segmentation errors.  This approach helps to identify group\ndifferences in patients with neurodegenerative disease  (Senjem et al. ,  2005) .  All subjects were\nused to create the template,  and custom images for each subject were generated by applying\naffine and deformation parameters obtained from normalizing the grey matter images, \nsegmented in native space,  to the custom template.  Voxel values were modulated by\nmultiplying them by the jacobian determinants derived from the spatial normalization step, \nand images were smoothed with a 12-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo identify gray matter regions significantly atrophied in each syndrome vs.  HC1,  each group\nwas entered as a condition into a single model,  and linear contrasts were applied to derive five\nsyndromic atrophy maps.  From these maps,  we isolated the most significantly atrophied\ncortical region,  designated as the voxel with the peak t-score  (Table $2) .  We elected to use\nonly cortical seed ROIs because subcortical/limbic nuclei,  such as the caudate or amygdala, \nfeature a dense admixture of subnuclear projection fields and outputs with multi-network\nconnectivity.  Therefore,  after 4-mm fMRI data smoothing,  subcortical/limbic connectivity\nmaps become less straightforward to interpret than those derived using cortical seeds,  and we\nsought to treat all five network analyses similarly in this regard.  In addition,  VBM can\noverestimate periventricular volume loss due to atrophy-related spatial registration errors, even"

It remains unclear if inter-network relationships and whole-brain network topology\nare also altered and underpin cognitive and social-emotional functional deficits. \n\nMethods:  In total,  111 participants  (50 AD,  14 bvFTD,  and 47 age- and gender-matched healthy controls) \nunderwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI)  and neuropsychological assessments. \nFunctional connectivity was derived among 144 brain regions of interest.  Graph theoretical analysis was applied to\ncharacterize network integration,  segregation,  and module distinctiveness  (degree centrality,  nodal efficiency, \nwithin-module degree,  and participation coefficient)  in AD,  bvFTD,  and healthy participants.  Group differences in\ngraph theoretical measures and empirically derived network community structures,  as well as the associations\nbetween these indices and cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms,  were subject to general linear\nmodels,  with age,  gender,  education,  motion,  and scanner type controlled. \n\nResults:  Our results suggested that AD had lower integration in the default and control networks,  while bvFTD\nexhibited disrupted integration in the salience network.  Interestingly,  AD and bvFTD had the highest and lowest\ndegree of integration in the thalamus,  respectively.  Such divergence in topological aberration was recapitulated in\nnetwork segregation and module distinctiveness loss,  with AD showing poorer modular structure between the\ndefault and control networks,  and bvFTD having more fragmented modules in the salience network and subcortical\nregions.  Importantly,  aberrations in network topology were related to worse attention deficits and greater severity\nin neuropsychiatric symptoms across syndromes. \n\n (Continued on next page) \n\n* Correspondence:  helen. zhou@nus. edu. sg\n\nAdeline Su Lyn Ng,  Juan Wang and Kwun Kei Ng are Joint first authors\n*Nagaendran Kandiah and Juan Helen Zhou are Joint senior authors\nNeuroscience and Behavioral Disorders Program,  Duke-NUS Medical School, \nSingapore,  Singapore\n\n*Centre for Sleep and Cognition,  Department of Medicine,  Yong Loo Lin\nSchool of Medicine,  National University of Singapore,  Singapore,  Singapore\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n  The Author (s) .  2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License, \nwhich permits use,  sharing,  adaptation,  distribution and reproduction in any medium or format,  as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author (s)  and the source,  provide a link to the Creative Commons licence,  and indicate if\n\nchanges were made.

        "Background": "Alzheimer s disease  (AD)  and frontotemporal dementia\n (FTD)  remain two of the most common causes of de-\nmentia under the age of 65.  AD classically presents with\nimpairment in short-term memory and visuospatial abil-\nity,  sometimes with atypical deficits in other domains in\nyounger patients [81].  Frontotemporal dementia fre-\nquently presents with behavioral and personality change, \nknown as behavioral variant FTD  (bvFTD)  [89].  AD fea-\ntures typical atrophy in the posterior hippocampal-\ncingulo-temporal-parietal default mode network  (DN) \n (50,  94].  In contrast,  bvFTD relates to atrophy in the\nfrontoinsular-striatal salience/ventral attention network\n (SVAN)  [94,  95].  Increasingly,  diagnostic uncertainty in\nthe early stages of disease when minimal atrophy is seen\non structural neuroimaging [58] calls for more sensitive\nimaging phenotype.  The network-based neurodegenera-\ntion hypothesis proposes that neurodegenerative diseases\ntarget large-scale neural networks and regional vulner-\nability varies along network topology [86,  94].  Hence, \ncharting the convergence and divergence in the alter-\nations of brain network-based metrics caused by these\ndementia subtypes could help improve imaging marker\nsensitivity for differential diagnosis and symptoms map-\nping [9,  66,  72,  118]. \n\nBrain functional connectivity  (FC)  derived from spon-\ntaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent  (BOLD)  sig-\nnals [12] during resting-state  (or task-free)  functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging  (f[MRI)  has been proposed\nto be a network-sensitive imaging method [49].  Func-\ntionally connected brain regions show highly synchron-\nous slow fluctuation in BOLD signals and form\nfunctionally specialized clusters known as intrinsic con-\nnectivity networks,  including the DN and SVAN [100, \n118].  Importantly,  functional connectivity alterations are\ndifferent between neuropsychiatric and non-pathological\naging [22,  56,  74],  as well as among different dementia\nsubtypes paralleling their atrophy signatures [67].  In\nearly landmark studies,  compared to well-matched\nhealthy participants,  AD patients showed lower DN con-\nnectivity to posterior parieto-occipital regions with in-\ntensified SVAN connectivity,  while bvFTD patients\nshowed attenuated SVAN connectivity most notably in\nthe frontoinsular-striatal region with enhanced DN con-\nnectivity [117].  Furthermore,  disease  epicenter -based\nFC modeling was able to predict regional atrophy\n\nseverity in each of the five distinct neurodegenerative\ndisorders [116].  Studies like these underscored the value\nof studying network-specific FC.  However,  multiple\nathological mechanisms may co-exist [116],  and these\nathological changes may be associated with other FC\nroperties in dementia.  First,  alterations in inter-\nnetwork FC are also frequently reported [17].  In particu-\nar,  the regulatory relationship between the SVAN and\nDN  ( anti-correlations )  is believed to be critical for nor-\nmal cognition and may be compromised in dementia\n23,  75].  Second,  FC aberration can appear in brain net-\nworks outside the two reciprocating networks,  such as\nthe frontoparietal network associated with cognitive con-\ntrol,  attention,  and working memory,  as previously re-\norted in bvFTD [41].  Third,  structural and functional\ninsults in subcortical regions have been reported and\nmay be useful for tracking progression [6] and subtyping\n18].  Until now,  although a number of studies have\nattempted to incorporate these phenomena into existing\ndisease models by targeting subsets of networks or one\ndementia subtype [42,  90],  few has employed a whole-\nbrain connectome-based,  multiple-syndrome approach. \n\nGraph theoretical analyses on whole-brain functional\nconnectome are able to quantify complex brain network\ntopology including integration,  modularity,  and effi-\nciency using both nodal and global indices [19].  Com-\nmunity structure analysis characterizes how network\nnodes cluster into densely interconnected  communities \nto support behavioral and cognitive functions [31].  It has\ngarnered extensive use in investigating neuropsychiatric\ndisorders [15,  108].  For instance,  comparing patients\nwith early-onset AD  (EOAD)  and bvFTD [43],  EOAD\nshowed more severe global functional network alter-\nations,  while bvFTD showed relatively preserved global\nfunctional brain architecture but more focal alterations\nin nodal FC.  Still,  existing studies did not consider inter-\nnetwork connections,  subcortical regions,  and brain\nmodular structure simultaneously and investigated how\nbrain network topological features contribute to cogni-\ntive and behavioral symptoms between AD and bvFTD\n (34,  53].  Such studies are also severely under-\nrepresenting the Asian cohort,  where aging and demen-\ntia rates are among the worlds  highest. \n\nTo address these gaps,  we applied whole-brain connec-\ntome approach to a well-characterized Asian cohort.  We\nhypothesized that AD and bvFTD would show divergent\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nabnormalities in the topological organization of func-\ntional brain networks extending into subcortical and\ninter-network connections.  Patients with byFTD would\nhave more disrupted modular structure in the SVAN\nwhile patients with AD would show greater loss of net-\nwork modularity in the DN.  Both disorders would have\ndamaged subcortical modular structure.  We also pre-\ndicted that the SVAN and subcortical topological\nchanges would relate to behavioral problems while the\ntopological changes in the other higher-order cognitive\nnetworks such as DN and frontoparietal control network\nwould be associated with cognitive impairment.",
        "Methods": "Participants\n\nBetween April 2013 and January 2018,  168 participants\nwere recruited from the memory clinics at the National\nNeuroscience Institute,  Singapore [103,  107,  114] to\nundergo clinical,  neuropsychological,  and neuroimaging\nassessments.  Participants were evaluated by a panel of\ncognitive neurologists and trained psychologists and\ndeemed during consensus meetings to have fulfilled clin-\nical diagnostic criteria for AD [73] and bvFTD [89].  Des-\npite relying on predominantly clinical diagnostic criteria, \nwhich could contribute to mismatch with etiology,  past\nstudies suggested that focusing on patients with the\nmost typical clinical profile representative of each sub-\ntype would still yield remarkable insights that are largely\nconsistent with the underlying etiologies [119].  Healthy\ncontrol subjects were required to have a Mini-Mental\n\nTable 1 Subject demographics and clinical characteristics\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\nState Examination  (MMSE)  [44] score of 26 or above\nand a Clinical Dementia Rating  (CDR)  score of 0.  Exclu-\nsion criteria included the following:   (i)  a history of alco-\nhol or drug abuse;   (ii)  a current or known history of\nmajor depression and/or other neuropsychiatric condi-\ntions such as psychosis;   (iii)  comorbid neurodegenerative\ndisease such as Parkinson s disease;   (iv)  significant cere-\nbrovascular disease such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy\nand/or prior stroke;   (v)  presence of contraindications to\nMRI. \n\nOut of 168 participants,  we included 111 participants\nin the analyses  (50 subjects with AD, ' 14 subjects with\nbvFTD,  and 47 healthy control  (HC)  older adults,  see\nTable 1)  who passed quality control of both structural\nMRI and task-free fMRI data and fulfilled motion-\nscrubbing criteria  (see  Image Acquisition and Prepro-\ncessing  section) .  The three groups were well matched\nin their demographics including age,  gender,  ethnicity, \nand handedness.  This study was approved by the Sin-\ngHealth Institutional Ethics Review Board and written\ninformed consent was obtained from each participant\nprior to recruitment into the study. \n\nNeuropsychological assessments\n\nThe neuropsychological battery was performed by\ntrained psychologists and assessed global cognition as\nwell as five cognitive domains,  namely episodic memory, \nexecutive function,  attention,  language,  and visuospatial\nabilities.

Performance on the in-\ndividual tests in each of the five cognitive domains was\ntransformed into z-scores and defined as the domain-\nspecific z-scores.  Of the 111 participants,  16 individuals\ndid not have complete cognitive performance scores.  As\nsuch,  for further association analysis between network\ntopology and cognitive performance,  participants with\ncomplete neuropsychological scores  (37 AD,  13 bvFTD, \nand 45 HC)  were included.  Additionally,  the Neuro-\npsychiatric Inventory  (NPI)  [32] was used to measure\nneuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms.  Only pa-\ntients with complete NPI total severity scores across all\ncomponents  (25 AD and 12 bvFTD)  were included in\nbrain-NPI association analyses. \n\nImage acquisition and processing\n\nAll structural and functional images were collected using\neither a 3T Siemens Tim Trio system  (m7 = 39)  or a 3T\nPrisma Fit System  (Siemens,  Erlangen,  Germany)   (1 =\n72)  after scanner upgrade.  For each participant,  high-\nresolution T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired\nusing magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient\n (192 continuous sagittal slices,  TR/TE/TI = 2300/2. 28/\n900 ms,  flip angle = 9 ,  FOV = 256 x 240 mm/ ,  matrix =\n256 x 240,  isotropic voxel size=1. 0x 1. 0x 1. 0 mm , \nbandwidth = 240 Hz/pixel) .  An 8-min task-free resting-\nstate {MRI  (eyes-open with fixation)  was also acquired\nusing a single-shot EPI sequence  (36 axial slices,  TR/\nTE = 2000/30 ms,  flip angle = 90 ,  FOV = 192 x 192 mm , \nmatrix = 64 x 64,  isotropic voxel size = 3. 0 x 3. 0 x 3. 0\nmm?,  bandwidth = 2112 Hz/pixel) . \n\nBoth functional and structural images were prepro-\ncessed using a standard pipeline based on FMRIB Soft-\nware Library  (FSL)  [60] and Analysis of Functional\nNeurolmages software  (AFNI)  [30] following our previ-\nous approach [25,  27,  79,  80].  Preprocessing for the\nstructural images included  (1)  image noise reduction,   (2) \nskull stripping using the Brain Extraction Tool  (BET) , \n (3)  linear and nonlinear registration to the Montreal\nNeurological Institute  (MNI)  152 standard space,  and\n (4)  segmentation of the brain into gray matter,  white\nmatter,  and cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF)  compartments. \nPreprocessing for the functional images included  (1) \n\n While 2/50 AD cases also had prominent language deficits at\npresentation suggestive of logopenic aphasia,  their episodic memory\ndeficits remained the most significant and prominent\n\nPage 4 of 16\n\ndropping the first 5 volumes,   (2)  slice time and motion\ncorrection,   (3)  time series despiking and grand mean\nscaling,   (4)  smoothing using a Gaussian filter of 6mm\nfull-width at half maximum  (FWHM) ,   (5)  band-pass fil-\ntering between 0. 009 and 0. 1 Hz,   (6)  detrending  (both\nlinear and quadratic trends) ,   (7)  coregistration to partici-\npants  T1 images and then to MNI152 standard template\nusing linear  (FLIRT)  and nonlinear  (FNIRT)  transforma-\ntions,  and  (8)  regressing out confounds of motion  (six\nparameters) ,  white matter  (WM) ,  and cerebral spinal\nfluid  (CSF)  and global signal. \n\nTo minimize the effects of head motion,  motion scrub-\nbing was applied on task-free {MRI data by discarding\nvolumes with frame displacement  (FD)  > 0. 5 mm or vari-\nance of temporal derivative of time course over voxels\n (DVARS)  > 0. 5% [84].  After motion scrubbing,  partici-\npants with sufficient data  (at least 4 min)  were kept for\nanalyses. \n\nGraph theoretical analysis of functional brain networks\nWe constructed individual-level brain functional con-\nnectivity  (FC)  matrix from the preprocessed task-free\nfMRI data  (Fig.  1) .  The mean fMRI time course was ex-\ntracted from each of the 144 predefined regions of inter-\nest  (ROIs)  comprising 114 cortical regions [115] and 30\nsubcortical regions [105].  The cortical atlas was derived\nrom clustering resting-state data from 1000 healthy\nyoung adults;  each cortical ROI is affiliated with one of\nseventeen intrinsic functional brain networks that were\nighly replicable across individuals.  Due to the limited\nbrain coverage in certain scans,  141 ROIs  (nodes)  with\null coverage in all scans were retained for network con-\nstruction.  We then calculated Pearson s correlation be-\ntween the time series of each pair of ROIs,  resulting in a\n141 x 141 weighted non-binarized FC matrix for each in-\ndividual.  All main diagonal elements and negative con-\nnections  (edges)  in the matrices were set to zero.  Graph\ntheoretical analysis was performed to compare the net-\nwork topological properties among AD,  bvFTD,  and HC\ngroups,  focusing on their potential differences in brain\nnetwork integration,  segregation,  and network distinct-\niveness  (a concept closely related to segregation) .  We\nfirst thresholded the subject-level FC matrix using a\nrange of costs  (i. e. ,  the ratio of the total number of edges\nto the maximal number of possible edges)  from 0. 09 to\n0. 4 in 0. 01 steps.  The cost range was determined based\non the following criterion:   (1)  the small-worldness of the\nbrain networks should be greater than 1 [68,  109,  111], \n (2)  80% of nodes in each network should be fully con-\nnected [8],  and  (3)  the average number of connections\nper node should be larger than the log of the number of\nnodes [111].  We computed the following measures of\nnetwork integration,  segregation/distinctiveness,  and\nmodularity. \n\nNg et al.

We studied the network topological changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease  (AD)  and behavioral variant\nfrontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD)  compared to healthy controls  (HC)  and their association with cognition and behavior.  Subject-level functional\nconnectome  (FC)  was derived from task-free fMRI data based on pairwise Pearson's correlations between the 141 regions of interests  (see\n Methods  for details) .  Graph theoretical nodal-wise metrics including degree centrality and nodal efficiency related to network integration as well\nas module participation coefficient and within-module degree related to network segregation and distinctiveness were computed for FC. \nAlterations in functional network topology metrics were compared across groups and subsequently associated with cognition and behavior\n\nCorrelation matrix\n\nGraph theoretical\nanalysis\n\nIntegration\n\nNetwork integration evaluates the ability of distributed\nbrain regions to integrate and share information globally\n[91].  It was characterized by nodal degree centrality and\nefficiency in this study.  These metrics were calculated at\neach cost threshold and then integrated across the entire\nrange of cost thresholds to obtain a composite measure\nfor each participant [48].  Degree centrality quantifies the\ncapability of a node to catch whatever is flowing through\nthe network.  For a node i,  it is defined as the sum of the\nweight of all edges that are directly linked to a node: \n\nN\nD, = y Wij, \nj=l\n\nwhere w,  denotes the edges weight between node i and\nnode j. \n\nNodal efficiency measures the ability of a node to\npropagate information with the other nodes in the net-\nwork.  For a node i,  it is defined as: \n\nwhere L;  denotes the shortest path length between node\ni and j. \n\nSegregation/module distinctiveness\n\nNetwork segregation evaluates the ability of brain per-\nforming tasks in parallel,  and segregated modules are\nuseful for the development of specialized brain function\n[102].  We computed measures of within-module degree\nand participation coefficient to describe the segregation\nand distinctiveness of functional modules.  The within-\nmodule degree is a measure of intra-module connectivity\nand evaluates the connectedness of a node to other\nnodes in the same module [52].  The participation coeffi-\ncient,  on the other hand,  is a measure of inter-module\nconnectivity and evaluates how evenly distributed con-\nnections of a node are across modules [52]. \n\nWe first derived an empirical group-level community\nstructure for each group using a two-stage consensus\ncommunity detection proposed previously [10,  65].  In\nthe first stage,  community detection was conducted for\neach participant across a range of costs from 0. 09 to 0. 4\nin 0. 001 steps  (311 thresholds in total) .  The community\ndetection algorithm involved the following steps:   (1)  de-\nriving a community structure for each of the 311 cost\nthresholds using the Louvain algorithm [13];   (2)  con-\nstructing a co-classification matrix across all 311 com-\nmunity assignments in which each element represented\nthe frequency that a given pair of brain nodes was\nassigned to the same community;  and  (3)  performing a\nconsensus-based clustering method [65] on the co-\nclassification matrix to obtain a single final,  consensus\npartition for each individual participant.  In the second\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nstage,  we used the same steps to generate representative\ngroup-level community structures for each of the three\ngroups,  i. e,  community detection was performed on a\ngroup-level allegiance matrix that was created by sum-\nming the consensus community assignments of all indi-\nviduals in the group [16].  Community detection at both\nstages was performed using a range of y parameters\nfrom 1 to 6  (resolution parameter y determines the\nnumber of communities detected) .  We reported findings\nusing individual-level y= 3 and group-level y = 2,  as the\nbrain network communities derived from the HC group\nwith these two parameters best reflected the normative\nnetwork organizations described in previous literature\n (24,  26,  115]. \n\nBased on the group-level modular structures,  module-\nbased network properties,  which capture the role of\nnodes according to their pattern of intra- and inter-\nmodule connections [52],  were analyzed.  Specifically,  we\ncalculated the normalized within-module degree and\nparticipation coefficient at each node for each individual. \nThe normalized within-module degree at each node i\nprovides a measure of intra-modular connectivity and is\ndefined as: \n\nkn   Kn\n\n=F\n\ni\nwhere k, ,  is the number of edges connecting the node i\nto other nodes in the module n,  k,  is the average of ky, \nover all nodes in the module n,  and o, ,  is the standard\ndeviation of the intra-modular degrees in the module n. \n\nParticipation coefficient at each node i,  on the other\nhand,  provides a measure of inter-modular connectivity\nand is defined as: \n\nNK \\2\nP; =1- a\nyy  (i) \nwhere k;  is the total degree of the node i in the entire\nnetwork. \n\nModularity\n\nModularity refers to the degree to which modules/com-\nmunities dissociate from each other and is a particularly\nimportant topological attribute for functional brain net-\nworks [46].  To examine the extent to which patient\ngroups reorganized their network community structures\nrelative to HC,  we calculated the similarity of the group-\nlevel community partition between patient group and\nHC using the adjusted rand index [88] and a resampling\nmethod.  We first resampled 20 subgroups from each\ngroup by randomly selecting 10 subjects with replace-\nment in keeping with our focus on some representative\ngroup-level community structure based on _ the\n\nPage 6 of 16\n\nconsensus assignments across individuals,  instead of dir-\nect comparison of individual modularity structures.  The\ngroup-level community structure for each of the 20 sub-\ngroups was then derived using the methods described\nabove.  We calculated the adjusted rand index between\nthe community partition of each subgroup and the\ngroup-level modular structure obtained from all HC\nsubjects at the whole-brain level,  i. e. ,  this all-HC struc-\nture served as a common reference template. \n\nOne step further,  to evaluate the network-specific\ngroup differences in community structures,  we calcu-\nlated the adjusted rand indices of the community assign-\nment within the combined default mode and executive\ncontrol modules  (DN-CN community) ,  salience/ventral\nattention module  (SVAN community) ,  and subcortical\nmodule  (subcortical community)  between the two pa-\ntient groups and the whole HC group separately.  We\nchose these higher-order cognitive networks and subcor-\ntical regions based on the converging evidence of spe-\ncific connectivity disruptions in AD and bvFTD [117, \n119]. \n\nStatistical analyses\n\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nTo examine group differences in demographic and clin-\nical characteristics,  we performed chi-square test on the\ncategorical variables,  and one-way analysis of variance\n (ANOVA)  followed by post hoc two-tailed two-sample\nt-tests for pairwise comparisons on the continuous vari-\nables.  Significance was set at p<0. 05 after Bonferroni\ncorrection. \n\nGroup differences in brain network topological metrics\n\nTo examine group differences in nodal degree centrality, \nnodal efficiency,  within-module degree,  and participation\ncoefficient,  we employed linear regression models on\nthese nodal-wise metrics with group membership as the\neffect of interest while controlling for education years, \nscanner type,  and number of frames after motion scrub-\nbing.  We reported statistically significant results at\nps<. 05 uncorrected for a complete picture of all poten-\ntial differences between groups. \n\nGroup differences in modular structure\n\nTo compare the modular structure between groups,  we\nperformed one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc two-\ntailed two-sample t-tests on the adjusted rand indices\nseparately for the whole brain,  DN-CN community, \nSVAN community,  and subcortical community.  The\nBonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple\ncomparisons at the level of p < 0. 05. \nNg et al.

Only FC measures\nshowing significant group differences were considered. \nPearson s correlation analysis was performed between\nFC metrics and cognitive/behavioral scores after regres-\nsing out age,  gender,  education years,  and scanner type. \nTo further ascertain that the differences in graph the-\noretical measures between groups were more likely to be\nattributed to differences in topology instead of FC\nstrength differences [106],  we computed the mean FC\n (all edges surviving thresholding)  for each participant at\neach cost,  which was then aggregated across costs result-\ning in an area under the curve measure.  This integrated\nFC was subject to the same linear model used in the\nmain analyses.  Furthermore,  to account for potential\nconfound by group differences in regional atrophy,  we\nderived regional gray matter volume of each parcel  (see\nSupplementary Methods)  and included it and integrated\nFC as additional covariates in our analyses on the four\nnodal graph theoretical measures and correlation ana-\nlysis with cognitional performance and NPI.\nCheck for\nupdates\n\nDistinct network topology in Alzheimer s\ndisease and behavioral variant\nfrontotemporal dementia\n\nAdeline Su Lyn Ng ,  Juan Wang*\",  Kwun Kei Ng*\",  Joanna Su Xian Chong ,  Xing Qian ,  Joseph Kai Wei Lim , \n\nYi Jayne Tan',  Alisa Cui Wen Yong|,  Russell Jude Chander!,  Shahul Hameed ,  Simon Kang Seng Ting , \nagaendran Kandiah *' and Juan Helen Zhou**\"'\nunderwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI)  and neuropsychological assessments. \nFunctional connectivity was derived among 144 brain regions of interest.  Graph theoretical analysis was applied to\ncharacterize network integration,  segregation,  and module distinctiveness  (degree centrality,  nodal efficiency, \nwithin-module degree,  and participation coefficient)  in AD,  bvFTD,  and healthy participants.  Group differences in\ngraph theoretical measures and empirically derived network community structures,  as well as the associations\nbetween these indices and cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms,  were subject to general linear\nmodels,  with age,  gender,  education,  motion,  and scanner type controlled.\nParticipants\n\nBetween April 2013 and January 2018,  168 participants\nwere recruited from the memory clinics at the National\nNeuroscience Institute,  Singapore [103,  107,  114] to\nundergo clinical,  neuropsychological,  and neuroimaging\nassessments.  Participants were evaluated by a panel of\ncognitive neurologists and trained psychologists and\ndeemed during consensus meetings to have fulfilled clin-\nical diagnostic criteria for AD [73] and bvFTD [89].  Des-\npite relying on predominantly clinical diagnostic criteria, \nwhich could contribute to mismatch with etiology,  past\nstudies suggested that focusing on patients with the\nmost typical clinical profile representative of each sub-\ntype would still yield remarkable insights that are largely\nconsistent with the underlying etiologies [119].  Healthy\ncontrol subjects were required to have a Mini-Mental\n\nTable 1 Subject demographics and clinical characteristics\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\nState Examination  (MMSE)  [44] score of 26 or above\nand a Clinical Dementia Rating  (CDR)  score of 0.

The three groups were well matched\nin their demographics including age,  gender,  ethnicity, \nand handedness.  This study was approved by the Sin-\ngHealth Institutional Ethics Review Board and written\ninformed consent was obtained from each participant\nprior to recruitment into the study. \n\nNeuropsychological assessments\n\nThe neuropsychological battery was performed by\ntrained psychologists and assessed global cognition as\nwell as five cognitive domains,  namely episodic memory, \nexecutive function,  attention,  language,  and visuospatial\nabilities.

Performance on the in-\ndividual tests in each of the five cognitive domains was\ntransformed into z-scores and defined as the domain-\nspecific z-scores.  Of the 111 participants,  16 individuals\ndid not have complete cognitive performance scores.  As\nsuch,  for further association analysis between network\ntopology and cognitive performance,  participants with\ncomplete neuropsychological scores  (37 AD,  13 bvFTD, \nand 45 HC)  were included.  Additionally,  the Neuro-\npsychiatric Inventory  (NPI)  [32] was used to measure\nneuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms.  Only pa-\ntients with complete NPI total severity scores across all\ncomponents  (25 AD and 12 bvFTD)  were included in\nbrain-NPI association analyses. \n\nImage acquisition and processing\n\nAll structural and functional images were collected using\neither a 3T Siemens Tim Trio system  (m7 = 39)  or a 3T\nPrisma Fit System  (Siemens,  Erlangen,  Germany)   (1 =\n72)  after scanner upgrade.  For each participant,  high-\nresolution T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired\nusing magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient\n (192 continuous sagittal slices,  TR/TE/TI = 2300/2. 28/\n900 ms,  flip angle = 9 ,  FOV = 256 x 240 mm/ ,  matrix =\n256 x 240,  isotropic voxel size=1. 0x 1. 0x 1. 0 mm , \nbandwidth = 240 Hz/pixel) .  An 8-min task-free resting-\nstate {MRI  (eyes-open with fixation)  was also acquired\nusing a single-shot EPI sequence  (36 axial slices,  TR/\nTE = 2000/30 ms,  flip angle = 90 ,  FOV = 192 x 192 mm , \nmatrix = 64 x 64,  isotropic voxel size = 3. 0 x 3. 0 x 3. 0\nmm?,  bandwidth = 2112 Hz/pixel) . \n\nBoth functional and structural images were prepro-\ncessed using a standard pipeline based on FMRIB Soft-\nware Library  (FSL)  [60] and Analysis of Functional\nNeurolmages software  (AFNI)  [30] following our previ-\nous approach [25,  27,  79,  80].  Preprocessing for the\nstructural images included  (1)  image noise reduction,   (2) \nskull stripping using the Brain Extraction Tool  (BET) , \n (3)  linear and nonlinear registration to the Montreal\nNeurological Institute  (MNI)  152 standard space,  and\n (4)  segmentation of the brain into gray matter,  white\nmatter,  and cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF)  compartments. \nPreprocessing for the functional images included  (1) \n\n While 2/50 AD cases also had prominent language deficits at\npresentation suggestive of logopenic aphasia,  their episodic memory\ndeficits remained the most significant and prominent\n\nPage 4 of 16\n\ndropping the first 5 volumes,   (2)  slice time and motion\ncorrection,   (3)  time series despiking and grand mean\nscaling,   (4)  smoothing using a Gaussian filter of 6mm\nfull-width at half maximum  (FWHM) ,   (5)  band-pass fil-\ntering between 0. 009 and 0. 1 Hz,   (6)  detrending  (both\nlinear and quadratic trends) ,   (7)  coregistration to partici-\npants  T1 images and then to MNI152 standard template\nusing linear  (FLIRT)  and nonlinear  (FNIRT)  transforma-\ntions,  and  (8)  regressing out confounds of motion  (six\nparameters) ,  white matter  (WM) ,  and cerebral spinal\nfluid  (CSF)  and global signal. \n\nTo minimize the effects of head motion,  motion scrub-\nbing was applied on task-free {MRI data by discarding\nvolumes with frame displacement  (FD)  > 0. 5 mm or vari-\nance of temporal derivative of time course over voxels\n (DVARS)  > 0. 5% [84].  After motion scrubbing,  partici-\npants with sufficient data  (at least 4 min)  were kept for\nanalyses. \n\nGraph theoretical analysis of functional brain networks\nWe constructed individual-level brain functional con-\nnectivity  (FC)  matrix from the preprocessed task-free\nfMRI data  (Fig.  1) .  The mean fMRI time course was ex-\ntracted from each of the 144 predefined regions of inter-\nest  (ROIs)  comprising 114 cortical regions [115] and 30\nsubcortical regions [105].  The cortical atlas was derived\nrom clustering resting-state data from 1000 healthy\nyoung adults;  each cortical ROI is affiliated with one of\nseventeen intrinsic functional brain networks that were\nighly replicable across individuals.  Due to the limited\nbrain coverage in certain scans,  141 ROIs  (nodes)  with\null coverage in all scans were retained for network con-\nstruction.  We then calculated Pearson s correlation be-\ntween the time series of each pair of ROIs,  resulting in a\n141 x 141 weighted non-binarized FC matrix for each in-\ndividual.  All main diagonal elements and negative con-\nnections  (edges)  in the matrices were set to zero.  Graph\ntheoretical analysis was performed to compare the net-\nwork topological properties among AD,  bvFTD,  and HC\ngroups,  focusing on their potential differences in brain\nnetwork integration,  segregation,  and network distinct-\niveness  (a concept closely related to segregation) .  We\nfirst thresholded the subject-level FC matrix using a\nrange of costs  (i. e. ,  the ratio of the total number of edges\nto the maximal number of possible edges)  from 0. 09 to\n0. 4 in 0. 01 steps.  The cost range was determined based\non the following criterion:   (1)  the small-worldness of the\nbrain networks should be greater than 1 [68,  109,  111], \n (2)  80% of nodes in each network should be fully con-\nnected [8],  and  (3)  the average number of connections\nper node should be larger than the log of the number of\nnodes [111].  We computed the following measures of\nnetwork integration,  segregation/distinctiveness,  and\nmodularity. \n\nNg et al.

We studied the network topological changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease  (AD)  and behavioral variant\nfrontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD)  compared to healthy controls  (HC)  and their association with cognition and behavior.  Subject-level functional\nconnectome  (FC)  was derived from task-free fMRI data based on pairwise Pearson's correlations between the 141 regions of interests  (see\nas module participation coefficient and within-module degree related to network segregation and distinctiveness were computed for FC. \nAlterations in functional network topology metrics were compared across groups and subsequently associated with cognition and behavior\n\nCorrelation matrix\n\nGraph theoretical\nanalysis\n\nIntegration\n\nNetwork integration evaluates the ability of distributed\nbrain regions to integrate and share information globally\n[91].  It was characterized by nodal degree centrality and\nefficiency in this study.  These metrics were calculated at\neach cost threshold and then integrated across the entire\nrange of cost thresholds to obtain a composite measure\nfor each participant [48].  Degree centrality quantifies the\ncapability of a node to catch whatever is flowing through\nthe network.  For a node i,  it is defined as the sum of the\nweight of all edges that are directly linked to a node: \n\nN\nD, = y Wij, \nj=l\n\nwhere w,  denotes the edges weight between node i and\nnode j. \n\nNodal efficiency measures the ability of a node to\npropagate information with the other nodes in the net-\nwork.  For a node i,  it is defined as: \n\nwhere L;  denotes the shortest path length between node\ni and j. \n\nSegregation/module distinctiveness\n\nNetwork segregation evaluates the ability of brain per-\nforming tasks in parallel,  and segregated modules are\nuseful for the development of specialized brain function\n[102].  We computed measures of within-module degree\nand participation coefficient to describe the segregation\nand distinctiveness of functional modules.  The within-\nmodule degree is a measure of intra-module connectivity\nand evaluates the connectedness of a node to other\nnodes in the same module [52].  The participation coeffi-\ncient,  on the other hand,  is a measure of inter-module\nconnectivity and evaluates how evenly distributed con-\nnections of a node are across modules [52]. \n\nWe first derived an empirical group-level community\nstructure for each group using a two-stage consensus\ncommunity detection proposed previously [10,  65].  In\nthe first stage,  community detection was conducted for\neach participant across a range of costs from 0. 09 to 0. 4\nin 0. 001 steps  (311 thresholds in total) .  The community\ndetection algorithm involved the following steps:   (1)  de-\nriving a community structure for each of the 311 cost\nthresholds using the Louvain algorithm [13];   (2)  con-\nstructing a co-classification matrix across all 311 com-\nmunity assignments in which each element represented\nthe frequency that a given pair of brain nodes was\nassigned to the same community;  and  (3)  performing a\nconsensus-based clustering method [65] on the co-\nclassification matrix to obtain a single final,  consensus\npartition for each individual participant.  In the second\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nstage,  we used the same steps to generate representative\ngroup-level community structures for each of the three\ngroups,  i. e,  community detection was performed on a\ngroup-level allegiance matrix that was created by sum-\nming the consensus community assignments of all indi-\nviduals in the group [16].  Community detection at both\nstages was performed using a range of y parameters\nfrom 1 to 6  (resolution parameter y determines the\nabove.  We calculated the adjusted rand index between\nthe community partition of each subgroup and the\ngroup-level modular structure obtained from all HC\nsubjects at the whole-brain level,  i. e. ,  this all-HC struc-\nture served as a common reference template. \n\nOne step further,  to evaluate the network-specific\ngroup differences in community structures,  we calcu-\nlated the adjusted rand indices of the community assign-\nment within the combined default mode and executive\ncontrol modules  (DN-CN community) ,  salience/ventral\nattention module  (SVAN community) ,  and subcortical\nmodule  (subcortical community)  between the two pa-\ntient groups and the whole HC group separately.  We\nchose these higher-order cognitive networks and subcor-\ntical regions based on the converging evidence of spe-\ncific connectivity disruptions in AD and bvFTD [117, \n119]. \n\nStatistical analyses\n\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nTo examine group differences in demographic and clin-\nical characteristics,  we performed chi-square test on the\ncategorical variables,  and one-way analysis of variance\n (ANOVA)  followed by post hoc two-tailed two-sample\nt-tests for pairwise comparisons on the continuous vari-\nables.  Significance was set at p<0. 05 after Bonferroni\ncorrection. \n\nGroup differences in brain network topological metrics\n\nTo examine group differences in nodal degree centrality, \nnodal efficiency,  within-module degree,  and participation\ncoefficient,  we employed linear regression models on\nthese nodal-wise metrics with group membership as the\neffect of interest while controlling for education years, \nscanner type,  and number of frames after motion scrub-\nFC as additional covariates in our analyses on the four\nnodal graph theoretical measures and correlation ana-\nlysis with cognitional performance and NPI.\nthe two studies  (e. g. ,  definition of control group and\nFTD diagnosis) . \n\nMore severe subcortical network topological damage in\nbvFTD\n\nSubcortical brain regions have been known to show se-\nlective,  early vulnerability to frontotemporal lobar de-\ngeneration  (FTLD)  pathology [93] resulting in functional\nnetwork alterations in byFTD [41,  53,  87,  117].  Here,  we\nfound that subcortical connectivity was disrupted espe-\ncially in bvFTD.  Compared to AD and HC,  bvFTD\nshowed most community dissimilarity in the SVAN\nmodule and subcortical module,  as a result of less segre-\ngated SVAN subsystems,   intrusion  of subcortical re-\ngions into cortical communities,  and the remarkable\nintegration of the striatum and thalamus regions.  Inter-\nestingly,  AD patients have higher integration in thalamus\nthan bvFTD patients.  Thalamic abnormality has been ar-\ngued to be crucial in early AD for its close circuitry with\nother parts of the episodic memory system  (the Papez\ncircuit,  [2])  and across the FTD spectrum for its putative\nkey role in regulating multiple cognitive,  motor,  and\nsocio-affective functions  (e. g. ,  atrophy [14]; ) .  In parallel, \nwithin-module degree and participation coefficient in\nmany striatum ROIs were altered  (both higher and\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nlower)  in byvFTD when compared to HC  (degree)  and\nAD  (participation coefficient) .  Compared to controls,  pa-\ntients with bvFTD have previously shown reduced func-\ntional connectivity in frontoinsular and basal ganglia\nnetworks [43];  volumetric changes in striatal and thal-\namic regions were also reported in bvFTD [59] and\nother FTD syndromes  (thalamus [14]; ) .  The cortico-\nstriatal-thalamic connections are essential to many fun-\ndamental cognitive processes such as cognitive control\n[54],  emotion regulation [64,  83],  and reward-decision\nmaking [40].  Their FC alterations and modular modifica-\ntions are consistent with deficits in socio-affective,  auto-\nnomic processing,  and executive function in bvFTD [38, \n89]. \n\nTo our knowledge,  this is the first study to show alter-\nations of subcortical structures in both nodal and modu-\nlar organization in bvFTD.  While more replications are\nneeded to ascertain the direction and functional implica-\ntions of the FC and organizational changes in the stri-\natum and thalamus,  finding from Jakabek and colleagues\n[59] suggested that these relationships might be\ndependent on regional structural connectivity.  Specific-\nally,  their bvFTD patients had overall lower subcortical\ngray matter volume than HC,  but striatal and thalamic\nregions with white matter connection to the medial pre-\nfrontal cortex,  unexpectedly had significantly larger vol-\nume,  possibly representing compensatory or maladaptive\nnetwork remodeling.  Such variations are likely to exert\ninfluences on their corresponding functional network\nprofiles. \n\nAlterations in integration and segregation of associative\nnetworks correlated with cognition and neuropsychiatric\nsymptom severity\n\nFinally,  we observed that brain regions showing group\ndifferences in network integration and segregation prop-\nerties demonstrated reliable association with cognitive\ndeficits and symptom severity across subtypes,  suggest-\ning that while the two subtypes have reciprocal clinical\nhenotypes and neural alterations,  some deficits vary\nquantitatively along a  dementia spectrum  instead of\nshowing stark qualitative differences,  some of which\nmight be better captured in between-network properties\n17,  119].  Across all patients,  better performance on at-\ntention was associated with higher integration  (nodal ef-\niciency)  in the right precuneus of the CN.  While\ndesignated as the control network regions,  precuneus\nas been argued to be dissociable from the core dorsal\nDN and form its own posterior memory network  (PMN) \nreflecting attentional and mnemonic processes such as\nnovelty and familiarity of the to-be-remembered items\n47],  memory [96],  and its retrieval [55].  Alterations of\nthe intra- and inter-network PMN FC was shown to dif-\nerentiate between normal and pathological  (AD)  aging\n\nPage 12 of 16\n\n (57,  63].  The linear positive association with an atten-\ntional test with a putative memory component [62,  112]\nis consistent with its putative functionality and further\nshowcased its purported sensitivity to disease status in\ndementia in general.  With more bvFTD patients in-\ncluded,  future studies can investigate if the precuneus or\nPMN,  considered separately of the DN,  has differential\ndiagnostic values  (e. g. ,  by examining interactive effect\nbetween diagnosis and network measures on outcomes) . \n\nFurthermore,  worse NPI severity  (higher score)  was as-\nsociated with lower modularity  (higher participation co-\nefficient)  in the left frontomedial cortices of the SVAN\nacross all AD and bvFTD patients.  As discussed above, \nSVAN seemed to evidence the most loss of distinctive-\nness between subsystems in our bvFTD group compared\nto the rest.  Consistently,  more cross-talk between the\nfrontomedial cortices of the SVAN  (dorsal anterior cin-\ngulate cortex,  dACC)  with other non-SVAN regions,  as\nindicated by higher participation coefficient,  may indi-\ncate excessive and disruptive inter-network communica-\ntion.  Notably,  we also found that higher NPI severity\nscores were associated with higher within-module degree\nin the left cingulate cortex of the CN.  In the context of\ncognitive control,  the dACC is responsible for mediating\nongoing behavioral adaptation by providing a continu-\nously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand\nto optimize future behavioral responses [36,  98].  While\nhigher degree of the CN typically indicates better net-\nwork integrity and predicts better cognition and disease\nsymptoms [29],  both AD and bvFTD evidenced a less\nsegregated CN community structure compared to HC\n (Fig.  4,  yellow) .  Similar to our perspective on the SVAN, \nbut now within a module,  higher connectedness between\na node and its topological neighbors in an aberrant net-\nwork may indicate loss of network distinctiveness rather\nthan the more beneficial network integration.  Since the\ntwo ROIs are very close to each other,  we speculate that\nthese organizational changes in the vicinity of the  (ACC\ntogether may reflect a unified inward-outward break-\ndown of the SVAN and CN in the two dementia sub-\ntypes that might be maladaptive than compensatory in\nnature,  leading to behavioral symptoms.\n\nfor the human cerebral cortex.

Complex network measures of brain connectivity:\nunderwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI)  and neuropsychological assessments. \nFunctional connectivity was derived among 144 brain regions of interest.  Graph theoretical analysis was applied to\ncharacterize network integration,  segregation,  and module distinctiveness  (degree centrality,  nodal efficiency, \nwithin-module degree,  and participation coefficient)  in AD,  bvFTD,  and healthy participants.  Group differences in\ngraph theoretical measures and empirically derived network community structures,  as well as the associations\nbetween these indices and cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms,  were subject to general linear\nmodels,  with age,  gender,  education,  motion,  and scanner type controlled.\nParticipants\n\nBetween April 2013 and January 2018,  168 participants\nwere recruited from the memory clinics at the National\nNeuroscience Institute,  Singapore [103,  107,  114] to\nundergo clinical,  neuropsychological,  and neuroimaging\nassessments.  Participants were evaluated by a panel of\ncognitive neurologists and trained psychologists and\ndeemed during consensus meetings to have fulfilled clin-\nical diagnostic criteria for AD [73] and bvFTD [89].  Des-\npite relying on predominantly clinical diagnostic criteria, \nwhich could contribute to mismatch with etiology,  past\nstudies suggested that focusing on patients with the\nmost typical clinical profile representative of each sub-\ntype would still yield remarkable insights that are largely\nconsistent with the underlying etiologies [119].  Healthy\ncontrol subjects were required to have a Mini-Mental\n\nTable 1 Subject demographics and clinical characteristics\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\nState Examination  (MMSE)  [44] score of 26 or above\nand a Clinical Dementia Rating  (CDR)  score of 0.

The three groups were well matched\nin their demographics including age,  gender,  ethnicity, \nand handedness.  This study was approved by the Sin-\ngHealth Institutional Ethics Review Board and written\ninformed consent was obtained from each participant\nprior to recruitment into the study. \n\nNeuropsychological assessments\n\nThe neuropsychological battery was performed by\ntrained psychologists and assessed global cognition as\nwell as five cognitive domains,  namely episodic memory, \nexecutive function,  attention,  language,  and visuospatial\nabilities.

Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nEpisodic memory was assessed using the ADAS-Cog 10-\nword delayed recall [76];  executive function was assessed\nusing the Frontal Assessment Battery  (FAB)  [37];  atten-\ntion was assessed using the Digit Span forwards test\n[104];  language was assessed using the 30-word Boston\nNaming Test  (BNT)  [69];  and visuospatial ability was\nassessed using the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale\n (WAIS)  block design test [104].  Performance on the in-\ndividual tests in each of the five cognitive domains was\ntransformed into z-scores and defined as the domain-\nspecific z-scores.  Of the 111 participants,  16 individuals\ndid not have complete cognitive performance scores.  As\nsuch,  for further association analysis between network\ntopology and cognitive performance,  participants with\ncomplete neuropsychological scores  (37 AD,  13 bvFTD, \nand 45 HC)  were included.  Additionally,  the Neuro-\npsychiatric Inventory  (NPI)  [32] was used to measure\nneuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms.  Only pa-\ntients with complete NPI total severity scores across all\ncomponents  (25 AD and 12 bvFTD)  were included in\nbrain-NPI association analyses. \n\nImage acquisition and processing\n\nAll structural and functional images were collected using\neither a 3T Siemens Tim Trio system  (m7 = 39)  or a 3T\nPrisma Fit System  (Siemens,  Erlangen,  Germany)   (1 =\n72)  after scanner upgrade.  For each participant,  high-\nresolution T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired\nusing magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient\n (192 continuous sagittal slices,  TR/TE/TI = 2300/2. 28/\n900 ms,  flip angle = 9 ,  FOV = 256 x 240 mm/ ,  matrix =\n256 x 240,  isotropic voxel size=1. 0x 1. 0x 1. 0 mm , \nbandwidth = 240 Hz/pixel) .  An 8-min task-free resting-\nstate {MRI  (eyes-open with fixation)  was also acquired\nusing a single-shot EPI sequence  (36 axial slices,  TR/\nTE = 2000/30 ms,  flip angle = 90 ,  FOV = 192 x 192 mm , \nmatrix = 64 x 64,  isotropic voxel size = 3. 0 x 3. 0 x 3. 0\nmm?,  bandwidth = 2112 Hz/pixel) . \n\nBoth functional and structural images were prepro-\ncessed using a standard pipeline based on FMRIB Soft-\nware Library  (FSL)  [60] and Analysis of Functional\nNeurolmages software  (AFNI)  [30] following our previ-\nous approach [25,  27,  79,  80].  Preprocessing for the\nstructural images included  (1)  image noise reduction,   (2) \nskull stripping using the Brain Extraction Tool  (BET) , \n (3)  linear and nonlinear registration to the Montreal\nNeurological Institute  (MNI)  152 standard space,  and\n (4)  segmentation of the brain into gray matter,  white\nmatter,  and cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF)  compartments. \nPreprocessing for the functional images included  (1) \n\n While 2/50 AD cases also had prominent language deficits at\npresentation suggestive of logopenic aphasia,  their episodic memory\ndeficits remained the most significant and prominent\n\nPage 4 of 16\n\ndropping the first 5 volumes,   (2)  slice time and motion\ncorrection,   (3)  time series despiking and grand mean\nscaling,   (4)  smoothing using a Gaussian filter of 6mm\nfull-width at half maximum  (FWHM) ,   (5)  band-pass fil-\ntering between 0. 009 and 0. 1 Hz,   (6)  detrending  (both\nlinear and quadratic trends) ,   (7)  coregistration to partici-\npants  T1 images and then to MNI152 standard template\nusing linear  (FLIRT)  and nonlinear  (FNIRT)  transforma-\ntions,  and  (8)  regressing out confounds of motion  (six\nparameters) ,  white matter  (WM) ,  and cerebral spinal\nfluid  (CSF)  and global signal. \n\nTo minimize the effects of head motion,  motion scrub-\nbing was applied on task-free {MRI data by discarding\nvolumes with frame displacement  (FD)  > 0. 5 mm or vari-\nance of temporal derivative of time course over voxels\n (DVARS)  > 0. 5% [84].  After motion scrubbing,  partici-\npants with sufficient data  (at least 4 min)  were kept for\nanalyses. \n\nGraph theoretical analysis of functional brain networks\nWe constructed individual-level brain functional con-\nnectivity  (FC)  matrix from the preprocessed task-free\nfMRI data  (Fig.  1) .  The mean fMRI time course was ex-\ntracted from each of the 144 predefined regions of inter-\nest  (ROIs)  comprising 114 cortical regions [115] and 30\nsubcortical regions [105].  The cortical atlas was derived\nrom clustering resting-state data from 1000 healthy\nyoung adults;  each cortical ROI is affiliated with one of\nseventeen intrinsic functional brain networks that were\nighly replicable across individuals.  Due to the limited\nbrain coverage in certain scans,  141 ROIs  (nodes)  with\null coverage in all scans were retained for network con-\nstruction.  We then calculated Pearson s correlation be-\ntween the time series of each pair of ROIs,  resulting in a\n141 x 141 weighted non-binarized FC matrix for each in-\ndividual.  All main diagonal elements and negative con-\nnections  (edges)  in the matrices were set to zero.  Graph\ntheoretical analysis was performed to compare the net-\nwork topological properties among AD,  bvFTD,  and HC\ngroups,  focusing on their potential differences in brain\nnetwork integration,  segregation,  and network distinct-\niveness  (a concept closely related to segregation) .  We\nfirst thresholded the subject-level FC matrix using a\nrange of costs  (i. e. ,  the ratio of the total number of edges\nto the maximal number of possible edges)  from 0. 09 to\n0. 4 in 0. 01 steps.  The cost range was determined based\non the following criterion:   (1)  the small-worldness of the\nbrain networks should be greater than 1 [68,  109,  111], \n (2)  80% of nodes in each network should be fully con-\nnected [8],  and  (3)  the average number of connections\nper node should be larger than the log of the number of\nnodes [111].  We computed the following measures of\nnetwork integration,  segregation/distinctiveness,  and\nmodularity. \n\nNg et al.

We studied the network topological changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease  (AD)  and behavioral variant\nfrontotemporal dementia  (bvFTD)  compared to healthy controls  (HC)  and their association with cognition and behavior.  Subject-level functional\nconnectome  (FC)  was derived from task-free fMRI data based on pairwise Pearson's correlations between the 141 regions of interests  (see\nas module participation coefficient and within-module degree related to network segregation and distinctiveness were computed for FC. \nAlterations in functional network topology metrics were compared across groups and subsequently associated with cognition and behavior\n\nCorrelation matrix\n\nGraph theoretical\nanalysis\n\nIntegration\n\nNetwork integration evaluates the ability of distributed\nbrain regions to integrate and share information globally\n[91].  It was characterized by nodal degree centrality and\nefficiency in this study.  These metrics were calculated at\neach cost threshold and then integrated across the entire\nrange of cost thresholds to obtain a composite measure\nfor each participant [48].  Degree centrality quantifies the\ncapability of a node to catch whatever is flowing through\nthe network.  For a node i,  it is defined as the sum of the\nweight of all edges that are directly linked to a node: \n\nN\nD, = y Wij, \nj=l\n\nwhere w,  denotes the edges weight between node i and\nnode j. \n\nNodal efficiency measures the ability of a node to\npropagate information with the other nodes in the net-\nwork.  For a node i,  it is defined as: \n\nwhere L;  denotes the shortest path length between node\ni and j. \n\nSegregation/module distinctiveness\n\nNetwork segregation evaluates the ability of brain per-\nforming tasks in parallel,  and segregated modules are\nuseful for the development of specialized brain function\n[102].  We computed measures of within-module degree\nand participation coefficient to describe the segregation\nand distinctiveness of functional modules.  The within-\nmodule degree is a measure of intra-module connectivity\nand evaluates the connectedness of a node to other\nnodes in the same module [52].  The participation coeffi-\ncient,  on the other hand,  is a measure of inter-module\nconnectivity and evaluates how evenly distributed con-\nnections of a node are across modules [52]. \n\nWe first derived an empirical group-level community\nstructure for each group using a two-stage consensus\ncommunity detection proposed previously [10,  65].  In\nthe first stage,  community detection was conducted for\neach participant across a range of costs from 0. 09 to 0. 4\nin 0. 001 steps  (311 thresholds in total) .  The community\ndetection algorithm involved the following steps:   (1)  de-\nriving a community structure for each of the 311 cost\nthresholds using the Louvain algorithm [13];   (2)  con-\nstructing a co-classification matrix across all 311 com-\nmunity assignments in which each element represented\nthe frequency that a given pair of brain nodes was\nassigned to the same community;  and  (3)  performing a\nconsensus-based clustering method [65] on the co-\nclassification matrix to obtain a single final,  consensus\npartition for each individual participant.  In the second\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nstage,  we used the same steps to generate representative\ngroup-level community structures for each of the three\ngroups,  i. e,  community detection was performed on a\ngroup-level allegiance matrix that was created by sum-\nming the consensus community assignments of all indi-\nviduals in the group [16].  Community detection at both\nstages was performed using a range of y parameters\nfrom 1 to 6  (resolution parameter y determines the\nabove.  We calculated the adjusted rand index between\nthe community partition of each subgroup and the\ngroup-level modular structure obtained from all HC\nsubjects at the whole-brain level,  i. e. ,  this all-HC struc-\nture served as a common reference template. \n\nOne step further,  to evaluate the network-specific\ngroup differences in community structures,  we calcu-\nlated the adjusted rand indices of the community assign-\nment within the combined default mode and executive\ncontrol modules  (DN-CN community) ,  salience/ventral\nattention module  (SVAN community) ,  and subcortical\nmodule  (subcortical community)  between the two pa-\ntient groups and the whole HC group separately.  We\nchose these higher-order cognitive networks and subcor-\ntical regions based on the converging evidence of spe-\ncific connectivity disruptions in AD and bvFTD [117, \n119]. \n\nStatistical analyses\n\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nTo examine group differences in demographic and clin-\nical characteristics,  we performed chi-square test on the\ncategorical variables,  and one-way analysis of variance\n (ANOVA)  followed by post hoc two-tailed two-sample\nt-tests for pairwise comparisons on the continuous vari-\nables.  Significance was set at p<0. 05 after Bonferroni\ncorrection. \n\nGroup differences in brain network topological metrics\n\nTo examine group differences in nodal degree centrality, \nnodal efficiency,  within-module degree,  and participation\ncoefficient,  we employed linear regression models on\nthese nodal-wise metrics with group membership as the\neffect of interest while controlling for education years, \nscanner type,  and number of frames after motion scrub-\nFC as additional covariates in our analyses on the four\nnodal graph theoretical measures and correlation ana-\nlysis with cognitional performance and NPI.\n\nfor the human cerebral cortex.

        "Results": "Group differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nAll three groups were well matched in demographics, \nsuch as age,  gender,  handedness,  and ethnicity.  The pa-\ntient groups had lower level of education than HC.  As\nexpected,  the two patient groups showed lower scores in\nCDR,  MMSE/MoCA,  specific cognitive domains,  and\nneuropsychiatric symptoms  (NPI)  than NC.  AD and\nbvFTD were comparable in education,  CDR,  MMSE/\nMoCA.  AD displayed more severe episodic memory def-\nicit than bvFTD  (t=  -  2. 74,  p = 0. 008) ,  while bvFTD dis-\nplayed more severe language deficit  (t =  -  1. 82,  p = 0. 07) \nand neuropsychiatric symptoms  (  = 3. 59,  p = 0. 001)  than\nAD.  No group difference was found between AD and\nbvFTD in terms of executive function,  attention,  and\nvisuospatial ability.  These profiles confirmed that our\nAD patients had a predominantly amnestic,  multi-\ndomain presentation. \n\nGroup differences in brain network integration\n\nGroups did not differ in mean FC strength  (p = . 44)  over\nthe selected cost range  ( integrated FC ) ,  suggesting that\nthe differences in network properties between groups\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\ncould not be merely due to a group difference in con-\nnectivity strength [106].  The AD and bvFTD groups\nshowed substantial divergent alterations in network inte-\ngration in terms of degree centrality and nodal efficiency\ncompared with HC group,  especially in DN,  CN,  SVAN, \nand subcortical networks.  Specifically,  AD patients had\nlower degree centrality in the right temporal gyrus,  but\nhigher degree centrality in the thalamus and left inferior\nparietal lobule compared to HC  (Fig.  2,  top row) .  In\ncomparison,  bvFTD patients had lower degree centrality\nin the thalamus and insula of SVAN but higher degree\ncentrality in the dorsal prefrontal cortex of DN and\nintraparietal sulcus of CN relative to HC.  For nodal effi-\nciency  (Fig.  2,  bottom row;  Supplementary Tables 1 &\n2) ,  AD patients had lower nodal efficiency in the CN re-\ngions including right temporal gyrus and precuneus but\nhigher nodal efficiency in thalamus compared to HC; \nbvFTD patients showed lower nodal efficiency in the in-\nsula and thalamus. \n\nSimilarly,  direct contrasting between the two patient\ngroups also revealed that compared to AD,  bvFTD had\nlower degree centrality and nodal efficiency in the\nSVAN,  limbic system,  and subcortical regions including\nstriatum and thalamus,  but stronger degree centrality in\nposterior cingulate cortex and intraparietal sulcus,  re-\ngions belonging to the DN and CN  (Supplementary\nTable 1 & 2) .  Results remained largely unchanged after\nincluding integrated FC and regional atrophy  (Supple-\nmentary Tables 1 & 2)  as additional covariates. \n\nGroup differences in brain network segregation and\ndistinctiveness\nWe found that AD and bvFTD groups exhibited\nnetwork-specific reductions in segregation and distinct-\niveness  (i. e. ,  lower within-module degree and higher par-\nticipation coefficient)  compared with HC.  Such network\ntopological changes were found mainly in the DN and\nCN for AD but SVAN and striatum in bvFTD. \nSpecifically,  for within-module degree,  a measure of\nintra-network connectedness,  AD showed lower con-\nnectivity in the precuneus of the CN,  posterior cingulate\ncortex of DN,  and hippocampus but higher connectivity\nin the limbic system,  medial parietal cortex of SVAN, \nthe sensorimotor areas,  and subcortical regions  (Fig.  3, \ntop left) .  In bvFTD,  there was lower connectivity in the\ninsular,  prefrontal,  and parietal ROIs of the SVAN and\nstriatum but higher connectivity in the anterior cingulate\ncortex,  prefrontal cortex,  and inferior parietal cortex,  re-\ngions belonging to the CN and DN  (Fig.  3,  top center) . \nInterestingly,  both higher and lower connectivity was ob-\nserved in the subcortical regions.  For participation coef-\nficient,  a measure of inter-network distinctiveness, \ncompared to HC,  AD showed higher coefficient  (i. e. , \nlower distinctiveness)  in the CN  (the inferior parietal\nNg et al.

In parallel,  higher\nwithin-module degree in the left anterior cingulate cor-\ntex of the CN  (Fig.  5 middle)  and higher participation\ncoefficient in the left medial prefrontal cortex of the\nSVAN  (Fig.  5 right)  across all patients were associated\nwith more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms as mea-\nsured by the total NPI severity scores.

Interestingly,  AD and bvFTD had the highest and lowest\ndegree of integration in the thalamus,  respectively.  Such divergence in topological aberration was recapitulated in\nnetwork segregation and module distinctiveness loss,  with AD showing poorer modular structure between the\ndefault and control networks,  and bvFTD having more fragmented modules in the salience network and subcortical\nregions.  Importantly,  aberrations in network topology were related to worse attention deficits and greater severity\nin neuropsychiatric symptoms across syndromes. \n\n (Continued on next page) \n\n* Correspondence:  helen. zhou@nus. edu. sg\n\nAdeline Su Lyn Ng,  Juan Wang and Kwun Kei Ng are Joint first authors\n*Nagaendran Kandiah and Juan Helen Zhou are Joint senior authors\nNeuroscience and Behavioral Disorders Program,  Duke-NUS Medical School, \nSingapore,  Singapore\n\n*Centre for Sleep and Cognition,  Department of Medicine,  Yong Loo Lin\nSchool of Medicine,  National University of Singapore,  Singapore,  Singapore\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n  The Author (s) .  2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License, \nwhich permits use,  sharing,  adaptation,  distribution and reproduction in any medium or format,  as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author (s)  and the source,  provide a link to the Creative Commons licence,  and indicate if\n\nchanges were made.

Specifically,  we\ncalculated the normalized within-module degree and\nparticipation coefficient at each node for each individual. \nThe normalized within-module degree at each node i\nprovides a measure of intra-modular connectivity and is\ndefined as: \n\nkn   Kn\n\n=F\nps<. 05 uncorrected for a complete picture of all poten-\ntial differences between groups. \n\nGroup differences in modular structure\n\nTo compare the modular structure between groups,  we\nperformed one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc two-\ntailed two-sample t-tests on the adjusted rand indices\nseparately for the whole brain,  DN-CN community, \nSVAN community,  and subcortical community.  The\nBonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple\ncomparisons at the level of p < 0. 05. \nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nCorrelation of the nodal-wise network properties with\ncognitive performance and neuropsychiatric\nsymptomatology\nTo assess the relationships between FC disruptions and\ncognitive performance as well as neuropsychiatric symp-\ntomatology,  we correlated the nodal-wise network mea-\nsures  (nodal degree centrality,  nodal efficiency,  within-\nmodule degree,  and participation coefficient)  with the\nfive cognitive domain scores as well as the total NPI se-\nverity scores across all patients.  Only FC measures\nshowing significant group differences were considered. \nPearson s correlation analysis was performed between\nFC metrics and cognitive/behavioral scores after regres-\nsing out age,  gender,  education years,  and scanner type. \nTo further ascertain that the differences in graph the-\noretical measures between groups were more likely to be\nattributed to differences in topology instead of FC\nstrength differences [106],  we computed the mean FC\n (all edges surviving thresholding)  for each participant at\neach cost,  which was then aggregated across costs result-\ning in an area under the curve measure.  This integrated\nFC was subject to the same linear model used in the\nmain analyses.  Furthermore,  to account for potential\nconfound by group differences in regional atrophy,  we\nderived regional gray matter volume of each parcel  (see\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nAll three groups were well matched in demographics, \nsuch as age,  gender,  handedness,  and ethnicity.  The pa-\ntient groups had lower level of education than HC.  As\nexpected,  the two patient groups showed lower scores in\nCDR,  MMSE/MoCA,  specific cognitive domains,  and\nneuropsychiatric symptoms  (NPI)  than NC.  AD and\nbvFTD were comparable in education,  CDR,  MMSE/\nMoCA.  AD displayed more severe episodic memory def-\nicit than bvFTD  (t=  -  2. 74,  p = 0. 008) ,  while bvFTD dis-\nplayed more severe language deficit  (t =  -  1. 82,  p = 0. 07) \nand neuropsychiatric symptoms  (  = 3. 59,  p = 0. 001)  than\nAD.  No group difference was found between AD and\nbvFTD in terms of executive function,  attention,  and\nvisuospatial ability.  These profiles confirmed that our\nAD patients had a predominantly amnestic,  multi-\ndomain presentation. \n\nGroup differences in brain network integration\n\nGroups did not differ in mean FC strength  (p = . 44)  over\nthe selected cost range  ( integrated FC ) ,  suggesting that\nthe differences in network properties between groups\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\ncould not be merely due to a group difference in con-\nnectivity strength [106].  The AD and bvFTD groups\nshowed substantial divergent alterations in network inte-\ngration in terms of degree centrality and nodal efficiency\ncompared with HC group,  especially in DN,  CN,  SVAN, \nand subcortical networks.  Specifically,  AD patients had\nlower degree centrality in the right temporal gyrus,  but\nhigher degree centrality in the thalamus and left inferior\nparietal lobule compared to HC  (Fig.  2,  top row) .  In\ncomparison,  bvFTD patients had lower degree centrality\nin the thalamus and insula of SVAN but higher degree\ncentrality in the dorsal prefrontal cortex of DN and\nintraparietal sulcus of CN relative to HC.  For nodal effi-\nciency  (Fig.  2,  bottom row;  Supplementary Tables 1 &\n2) ,  AD patients had lower nodal efficiency in the CN re-\ngions including right temporal gyrus and precuneus but\nhigher nodal efficiency in thalamus compared to HC; \nbvFTD patients showed lower nodal efficiency in the in-\nsula and thalamus. \n\nSimilarly,  direct contrasting between the two patient\ngroups also revealed that compared to AD,  bvFTD had\nlower degree centrality and nodal efficiency in the\nSVAN,  limbic system,  and subcortical regions including\nstriatum and thalamus,  but stronger degree centrality in\nposterior cingulate cortex and intraparietal sulcus,  re-\ngions belonging to the DN and CN  (Supplementary\nincluding integrated FC and regional atrophy  (Supple-\nmentary Tables 1 & 2)  as additional covariates. \n\nGroup differences in brain network segregation and\ndistinctiveness\nWe found that AD and bvFTD groups exhibited\nnetwork-specific reductions in segregation and distinct-\niveness  (i. e. ,  lower within-module degree and higher par-\nticipation coefficient)  compared with HC.  Such network\ntopological changes were found mainly in the DN and\nCN for AD but SVAN and striatum in bvFTD. \nSpecifically,  for within-module degree,  a measure of\nintra-network connectedness,  AD showed lower con-\nnectivity in the precuneus of the CN,  posterior cingulate\ncortex of DN,  and hippocampus but higher connectivity\nin the limbic system,  medial parietal cortex of SVAN, \nthe sensorimotor areas,  and subcortical regions  (Fig.  3, \ntop left) .  In bvFTD,  there was lower connectivity in the\ninsular,  prefrontal,  and parietal ROIs of the SVAN and\nstriatum but higher connectivity in the anterior cingulate\ncortex,  prefrontal cortex,  and inferior parietal cortex,  re-\ngions belonging to the CN and DN  (Fig.  3,  top center) . \nInterestingly,  both higher and lower connectivity was ob-\nserved in the subcortical regions.  For participation coef-\nficient,  a measure of inter-network distinctiveness, \ncompared to HC,  AD showed higher coefficient  (i. e. , \nlower distinctiveness)  in the CN  (the inferior parietal\nNg et al.

In line with the reciprocal network proposal\n{117,  119],  both AD and bvFTD showed divergent\nbreakdown of modular structure in networks known to\nbe specifically affected in the respective syndrome:  AD\npatients showed greater vulnerability in the DN and CN\nwhile bvFTD patients showed greater disruptions in the\nSVAN and subcortical regions.  This study provides\nnovel insights into how decline in network integration, \nsegregation,  and distinctiveness encompassing both cor-\ntical and subcortical regions contribute to cognitive and\nbehavioral symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nDivergent alterations in network integration,  segregation, \nand modular structure in AD and bvFTD\n\nBrain networks consistently reported with reduced func-\ntional connectivity  (FC)  in AD and bvFTD are those\nwith the most neuropathologic changes and best associ-\nated with the symptom-deficit profiles [3,  4,  43,  61]. \nbvFTD patients consistently showed lower SVAN con-\nnectivity relative to AD [41,  117],  while early-onset and\nlate-onset AD patients showed lower DN connectivity\ncharacteristic memory-executive dysfunction in AD [71]\nand social-emotional dysfunction in bvFTD [92].  Never-\ntheless,  these reduced within-network FC are only one\nfacet of the large-scale network structure alterations in\nneurodegenerative disorders.  Increasing number of stud-\nies have shown that transitions between a dedicated but\nisolated information processing mode  (i. e. ,  segregation) \nand a multimodal but costly communication mode  (i. e. \nintegration)  are essential for flexible and adaptive cogni-\nthat the most common neurodegenerative disorders may\n\nfeature divergent disruptions in brain functional network\nintegration and segregation. \n\nIntegration\n\nAD patients showed reduced network integration mainly\nin the DN that is classically affected by AD pathology\n[82].  In contrast,  bvFTD patients showed lower network\nintegration  (degree centrality and nodal efficiency)  in\ncortical and subcortical areas belonging to the SVAN\n (insular,  thalamus and striatum) .  Head-to-head compari-\nsons between the two disorders further confirmed that\nthe DN and SVAN may be altered antagonistically in\nthese two dementia subtypes  (in particular lower degree\ncentrality and nodal efficiency in the SVAN but stronger\ndegree centrality in posterior cingulate cortex and intra-\narietal sulcus contrasting bvFTD against AD) ,  with AD\nand bvFTD attributable to divergent liberation and sup-\nression of the two networks,  as the reciprocal network\nmodel purports [119].  For instance,  failed feedback from\nthe DN  (cf [28])  might explain the correlation between\nigher FC in SVAN and symptoms of hyperactivity  (e. g. , \nagitation,  irritability,  aberrant motor behavior,  euphoria, \nand disinhibition)  in AD [7]. \n\nWe noted that the anterior and ventral medial pre-\nrontal cortices  (a/vmPFC) ,  typically core regions of the\nanterior DN,  evidenced higher nodal efficiency in AD\ncompared to bvFTD.  Past studies have repeatedly dem-\nonstrated the presence of subsystems within the DN, \nwith the posterior DN [61] and the subsystem involving\nthe medial temporal lobe [85] argued to be most affected\nby AD pathologies relative to other subsystems.  Our\nby the posterior DN in AD.  While a lack of measure of\n\nbetween the DN and SVAN when these networks are\ncompromised by dementia pathologies.  Applying graph\ntheoretical measures on resting-state EEG data,  de Hann\nand colleagues [35] concluded that compared to controls\nwith subjective memory complaints,  the brain functional\norganization of AD was more random,  while that of\nFTD was more  (excessively)  regular,  possibly attributable\nto distinct pathologies.  It would be of interest for future\nstudies to examine if the specific modularity changes re-\nported here explain the opposite topological deviations\nfrom  small-worldness  that typically characterizes opti-\nmight be impacted by the choice of brain parcellation\nhave been found across parcellations [1,  97],  one-\nscheme-fits-all sometimes risks oversimplification [5, \n113].  Future work should focus on using individualized\nparcellations [25,  27] to derive and compare brain\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nnetwork topology.  Third,  while the group differences in\nnodal-wise graph theoretical measures did not survive\nfunctional network organization  (community structures) \nwas not affected by this correction.  Related,  while our\npatient groups were comparable on overall FC strength, \nit will be very informative to systematically dissociate the\ncontribution of FC strength and true topological changes\nto the observed group differences in the brain network\nproperties [106].  Forth,  our participants were grouped\naccording to clinical diagnosis;  while we adopted a high\nstandard in our diagnosis and demonstrated their diver-\ngent clinical profiles,  uncertainty such as mislabelling\n (e. g. ,  due to clinical phenotype and pathology mismatch, \n{101])  may still be inevitable.  Future studies with\ndisease-specific biomarkers such as amyloid,  tau,  and\ncerebrovascular status will be important to studying dis-\nease heterogeneity [24 27].  Finally,  our study focused\nmainly on the differences between the two dementia\nsubtypes;  conversely,  studying their overlapping symp-\ntoms and the underlying neural substrates would be\nhighly informative,  an approach that has gained momen-\ntum in many neuropsychiatric conditions  (e. g. ,  [45,  70]) .\nThis work was supported by Singapore's National Medical Research Council\n (CS-NIG NRN17/002 to A.

Importantly,  aberrations in network topology were related to worse attention deficits and greater severity\nin neuropsychiatric symptoms across syndromes. \n\n (Continued on next page) \n\n* Correspondence:  helen. zhou@nus. edu. sg\n\nAdeline Su Lyn Ng,  Juan Wang and Kwun Kei Ng are Joint first authors\n*Nagaendran Kandiah and Juan Helen Zhou are Joint senior authors\nNeuroscience and Behavioral Disorders Program,  Duke-NUS Medical School, \nSingapore,  Singapore\n\n*Centre for Sleep and Cognition,  Department of Medicine,  Yong Loo Lin\nSchool of Medicine,  National University of Singapore,  Singapore,  Singapore\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n  The Author (s) .  2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License, \nwhich permits use,  sharing,  adaptation,  distribution and reproduction in any medium or format,  as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author (s)  and the source,  provide a link to the Creative Commons licence,  and indicate if\n\nchanges were made.

Specifically,  we\ncalculated the normalized within-module degree and\nparticipation coefficient at each node for each individual. \nThe normalized within-module degree at each node i\nprovides a measure of intra-modular connectivity and is\ndefined as: \n\nkn   Kn\n\n=F\n\ni\nwhere k, ,  is the number of edges connecting the node i\nto other nodes in the module n,  k,  is the average of ky, \nover all nodes in the module n,  and o, ,  is the standard\ndeviation of the intra-modular degrees in the module n. \n\nParticipation coefficient at each node i,  on the other\nhand,  provides a measure of inter-modular connectivity\nand is defined as: \n\nNK \\2\nP; =1- a\nyy  (i) \nwhere k;  is the total degree of the node i in the entire\nnetwork. \n\nModularity\n\nModularity refers to the degree to which modules/com-\nmunities dissociate from each other and is a particularly\nimportant topological attribute for functional brain net-\nworks [46].  To examine the extent to which patient\ngroups reorganized their network community structures\nrelative to HC,  we calculated the similarity of the group-\nlevel community partition between patient group and\nHC using the adjusted rand index [88] and a resampling\nmethod.  We first resampled 20 subgroups from each\ngroup by randomly selecting 10 subjects with replace-\nment in keeping with our focus on some representative\ngroup-level community structure based on _ the\n\nPage 6 of 16\n\nconsensus assignments across individuals,  instead of dir-\nect comparison of individual modularity structures.  The\ngroup-level community structure for each of the 20 sub-\nps<. 05 uncorrected for a complete picture of all poten-\ntial differences between groups. \n\nGroup differences in modular structure\n\nTo compare the modular structure between groups,  we\nperformed one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc two-\ntailed two-sample t-tests on the adjusted rand indices\nseparately for the whole brain,  DN-CN community, \nSVAN community,  and subcortical community.  The\nBonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple\ncomparisons at the level of p < 0. 05. \nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nCorrelation of the nodal-wise network properties with\ncognitive performance and neuropsychiatric\nsymptomatology\nTo assess the relationships between FC disruptions and\ncognitive performance as well as neuropsychiatric symp-\ntomatology,  we correlated the nodal-wise network mea-\nsures  (nodal degree centrality,  nodal efficiency,  within-\nmodule degree,  and participation coefficient)  with the\nfive cognitive domain scores as well as the total NPI se-\nverity scores across all patients.  Only FC measures\nshowing significant group differences were considered. \nPearson s correlation analysis was performed between\nFC metrics and cognitive/behavioral scores after regres-\nsing out age,  gender,  education years,  and scanner type. \nTo further ascertain that the differences in graph the-\noretical measures between groups were more likely to be\nattributed to differences in topology instead of FC\nstrength differences [106],  we computed the mean FC\n (all edges surviving thresholding)  for each participant at\neach cost,  which was then aggregated across costs result-\ning in an area under the curve measure.  This integrated\nFC was subject to the same linear model used in the\nmain analyses.  Furthermore,  to account for potential\nconfound by group differences in regional atrophy,  we\nderived regional gray matter volume of each parcel  (see\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics\n\nAll three groups were well matched in demographics, \nsuch as age,  gender,  handedness,  and ethnicity.  The pa-\ntient groups had lower level of education than HC.  As\nexpected,  the two patient groups showed lower scores in\nCDR,  MMSE/MoCA,  specific cognitive domains,  and\nneuropsychiatric symptoms  (NPI)  than NC.  AD and\nbvFTD were comparable in education,  CDR,  MMSE/\nMoCA.  AD displayed more severe episodic memory def-\nicit than bvFTD  (t=  -  2. 74,  p = 0. 008) ,  while bvFTD dis-\nplayed more severe language deficit  (t =  -  1. 82,  p = 0. 07) \nand neuropsychiatric symptoms  (  = 3. 59,  p = 0. 001)  than\nAD.  No group difference was found between AD and\nbvFTD in terms of executive function,  attention,  and\nvisuospatial ability.  These profiles confirmed that our\nAD patients had a predominantly amnestic,  multi-\ndomain presentation. \n\nGroup differences in brain network integration\n\nGroups did not differ in mean FC strength  (p = . 44)  over\nthe selected cost range  ( integrated FC ) ,  suggesting that\nthe differences in network properties between groups\n\nPage 7 of 16\n\ncould not be merely due to a group difference in con-\nnectivity strength [106].  The AD and bvFTD groups\nshowed substantial divergent alterations in network inte-\ngration in terms of degree centrality and nodal efficiency\ncompared with HC group,  especially in DN,  CN,  SVAN, \nand subcortical networks.  Specifically,  AD patients had\nlower degree centrality in the right temporal gyrus,  but\nhigher degree centrality in the thalamus and left inferior\nparietal lobule compared to HC  (Fig.  2,  top row) .  In\ncomparison,  bvFTD patients had lower degree centrality\nin the thalamus and insula of SVAN but higher degree\ncentrality in the dorsal prefrontal cortex of DN and\nintraparietal sulcus of CN relative to HC.  For nodal effi-\nciency  (Fig.  2,  bottom row;  Supplementary Tables 1 &\n2) ,  AD patients had lower nodal efficiency in the CN re-\ngions including right temporal gyrus and precuneus but\nhigher nodal efficiency in thalamus compared to HC; \nbvFTD patients showed lower nodal efficiency in the in-\nsula and thalamus. \n\nSimilarly,  direct contrasting between the two patient\ngroups also revealed that compared to AD,  bvFTD had\nlower degree centrality and nodal efficiency in the\nSVAN,  limbic system,  and subcortical regions including\nstriatum and thalamus,  but stronger degree centrality in\nposterior cingulate cortex and intraparietal sulcus,  re-\ngions belonging to the DN and CN  (Supplementary\nincluding integrated FC and regional atrophy  (Supple-\nmentary Tables 1 & 2)  as additional covariates. \n\nGroup differences in brain network segregation and\ndistinctiveness\nWe found that AD and bvFTD groups exhibited\nnetwork-specific reductions in segregation and distinct-\niveness  (i. e. ,  lower within-module degree and higher par-\nticipation coefficient)  compared with HC.  Such network\ntopological changes were found mainly in the DN and\nCN for AD but SVAN and striatum in bvFTD. \nSpecifically,  for within-module degree,  a measure of\nintra-network connectedness,  AD showed lower con-\nnectivity in the precuneus of the CN,  posterior cingulate\ncortex of DN,  and hippocampus but higher connectivity\nin the limbic system,  medial parietal cortex of SVAN, \nthe sensorimotor areas,  and subcortical regions  (Fig.  3, \ntop left) .  In bvFTD,  there was lower connectivity in the\ninsular,  prefrontal,  and parietal ROIs of the SVAN and\nstriatum but higher connectivity in the anterior cingulate\ncortex,  prefrontal cortex,  and inferior parietal cortex,  re-\ngions belonging to the CN and DN  (Fig.  3,  top center) . \nInterestingly,  both higher and lower connectivity was ob-\nserved in the subcortical regions.  For participation coef-\nficient,  a measure of inter-network distinctiveness, \ncompared to HC,  AD showed higher coefficient  (i. e. , \nlower distinctiveness)  in the CN  (the inferior parietal\nNg et al.

Simi-\nlarly,  AD showed lower network distinctiveness  (i. e. , \n\nhigher participation coefficient)  mainly in the DN and\nCN  (including parietal/occipital cortex,  inferior parietal\ncortex,  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)  compared to\nbvFTD  (Fig.  3 bottom right,  Supplementary Table 4) .  Re-\nsults remained largely unchanged after including inte-\ngrated FC and regional atrophy  (Supplementary Tables 3\n& 4)  as additional covariates. \n\nDivergent changes in brain functional modular\norganization in AD and bvFTD\n\nAnalysis on brains  modular organization not only re-\nvealed that patient groups showed global changes  (over-\nall network structure)  compared with HC group,  but\nthere were also disease-specific alterations in the three\nmodules of interest.

Over-\nall brain network community structure differed between\nthe three groups,  as quantified by partition dissimilarity\n (F (2,  57)  = 32. 64,  p<0. 001) .  The network community\nstructure derived from sub-samples of both patient\ngroups was significantly dissimilar,  as evidenced by their\nlower rand indices compared to the HC sub-samples\n (AD:  t= 7. 73,  p< 0. 001;  bvFTD:  t=5. 57,  p< 0. 001) .  Of\nnote,  bvFTD showed the least similarity  (bvFTD vs.  AD, \nt=2. 52,  p=0. 016) ,  implying substantial network alter-\nation in these patients  (Fig.  4b) .  Further examination of\ncommunity assignments for the patient groups revealed\ndistinct disease-specific changes in our community pat-\nterns of interest  (DN-CN:  F (2,  57) =7. 68,  p=0. 001; \nSVAN:  F (2,  57)  = 13. 36,  p< 0. 001;  subcortical:  F (2,  57)  =\n7. 04,  p = 0. 002) .  In the DN-CN modules,  AD had a sig-\nnificantly different modular partition from HC  (t= 3. 57, \np=0. 001)  and bvFTD  (t=2. 54,  p=0. 015) ,  reflecting\nlower segregation,  or less distinctiveness,  between DN\nand CN.  In the SVAN module,  bvFTD had a signifi-\ncantly different partition compared to HC  ( =5. 21,  p<\n0. 001)  and AD  (t= 4. 35,  p< 0. 001) .  This was character-\nized by less segregation within the community  (i. e. ,  be-\ntween SVAN_A and SVAN_B)  as well as extension of\nthe community to regions belonging to DN,  CN,  soma-\ntomotor,  and subcortical networks in the reference HC\nstructure.  Finally,  in the subcortical module,  the parti-\ntion of bvFTD was significantly different from HC  (t =\n\nPage 9 of 16\n\n3. 57,  p = 0. 001) ,  characterized by the integration between\nthe striatum and thalamus in bvFTD.  Subcortical com-\nmunity partition did not differ significantly between AD\nand bvFTD  (Fig.  4b) . \n\nAssociation of brain network topology with cognitive\nperformance and neuropsychiatric symptoms\n\nAmong the graph theoretical measures that showed sig-\nnificant group differences between AD and bvFTD, \nlower nodal efficiency in the right precuneus of the CN\nwas associated with lower attention performance  (digit\nspan forward z-score)   (Fig.  5 left) .  In parallel,  higher\nwithin-module degree in the left anterior cingulate cor-\ntex of the CN  (Fig.  5 middle)  and higher participation\ncoefficient in the left medial prefrontal cortex of the\nSVAN  (Fig.  5 right)  across all patients were associated\nwith more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms as mea-\nlargely unchanged after including integrated FC and re-\ngional atrophy as additional covariates  (Rs = . 31,  . 49,  and\n. 39,  respectively,  all ps < . 05) .\nopposite changes in FC strength between the two syn-\ndromes [53] by offering a different level of network de-\nscription.  In line with the reciprocal network proposal\n{117,  119],  both AD and bvFTD showed divergent\nbreakdown of modular structure in networks known to\nbe specifically affected in the respective syndrome:  AD\npatients showed greater vulnerability in the DN and CN\nwhile bvFTD patients showed greater disruptions in the\nSVAN and subcortical regions.  This study provides\nnovel insights into how decline in network integration, \nsegregation,  and distinctiveness encompassing both cor-\ntical and subcortical regions contribute to cognitive and\nbehavioral symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nDivergent alterations in network integration,  segregation, \nand modular structure in AD and bvFTD\n\nBrain networks consistently reported with reduced func-\ntional connectivity  (FC)  in AD and bvFTD are those\nwith the most neuropathologic changes and best associ-\nated with the symptom-deficit profiles [3,  4,  43,  61]. \nbvFTD patients consistently showed lower SVAN con-\nnectivity relative to AD [41,  117],  while early-onset and\nlate-onset AD patients showed lower DN connectivity\ncharacteristic memory-executive dysfunction in AD [71]\nand social-emotional dysfunction in bvFTD [92].  Never-\ntheless,  these reduced within-network FC are only one\nfacet of the large-scale network structure alterations in\nneurodegenerative disorders.  Increasing number of stud-\nies have shown that transitions between a dedicated but\nisolated information processing mode  (i. e. ,  segregation) \nand a multimodal but costly communication mode  (i. e. \nintegration)  are essential for flexible and adaptive cogni-\nthat the most common neurodegenerative disorders may\n\nfeature divergent disruptions in brain functional network\nintegration and segregation. \n\nIntegration\n\nAD patients showed reduced network integration mainly\nin the DN that is classically affected by AD pathology\n[82].  In contrast,  bvFTD patients showed lower network\nintegration  (degree centrality and nodal efficiency)  in\ncortical and subcortical areas belonging to the SVAN\n (insular,  thalamus and striatum) .  Head-to-head compari-\nsons between the two disorders further confirmed that\nthe DN and SVAN may be altered antagonistically in\nthese two dementia subtypes  (in particular lower degree\ncentrality and nodal efficiency in the SVAN but stronger\ndegree centrality in posterior cingulate cortex and intra-\narietal sulcus contrasting bvFTD against AD) ,  with AD\nand bvFTD attributable to divergent liberation and sup-\nression of the two networks,  as the reciprocal network\nmodel purports [119].  For instance,  failed feedback from\nthe DN  (cf [28])  might explain the correlation between\nigher FC in SVAN and symptoms of hyperactivity  (e. g. , \nagitation,  irritability,  aberrant motor behavior,  euphoria, \nand disinhibition)  in AD [7]. \n\nWe noted that the anterior and ventral medial pre-\nrontal cortices  (a/vmPFC) ,  typically core regions of the\nanterior DN,  evidenced higher nodal efficiency in AD\ncompared to bvFTD.  Past studies have repeatedly dem-\nonstrated the presence of subsystems within the DN, \nwith the posterior DN [61] and the subsystem involving\nthe medial temporal lobe [85] argued to be most affected\nby AD pathologies relative to other subsystems.  Our\nby the posterior DN in AD.  While a lack of measure of\nbiomarker status  (amyloid and tau;  see  Limitations and\nfuture directions )  prevented us from discussing the pos-\nsibility of sample heterogeneity,  the higher efficiency in\nthe anterior/ventral DN in AD than bvFTD could reflect\ncompensatory neural activity [20,  110].  Interestingly,  a/\nvmPFC is essential for socio-affective processing such as\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nemotional regulation [39];  its higher efficiency in AD,  to-\ngether with altered SVAN activity [7],  might account for\nincreased emotional contagion often reported in these\npatients [119]. \n\nModularity\n\nWhile a few fMRI studies have compared network alter-\nations between AD and bvFTD directly [43,  53,  117],  no\nstudy has yet proceeded to directly compare their net-\nwork community structure,  a succinct system-level de-\nscriptor of brain network structure [108,  110].  Applying\ngraph theoretical analysis and a resampling method to\nquantify module  (dis) similarity,  we found that both AD\nand bvFTD groups showed altered whole-brain commu-\nnity structure compared to HC.  The patient groups\nshowed significantly different community components\nfrom the HC both at the whole-brain and specific com-\nmunity levels  (Fig.  4) .  Normalized rand index also sug-\ngested that the two patient groups differed in their\ncommunity structures.  Of note,  this module dissimilarity\nbetween AD and bvFTD again demonstrated reciprocity\nat specific communities:  the similarity with the referent\ndefault-control community was the lowest in AD,  while\nthe similarity with the referent salience/ventral attention\ncommunity was the lowest in bvFTD. \n\nSegregation\n\nThe divergent network alterations in the two subtypes\nwere partly recapitulated in the community-derived\nnodal measures  (as opposed to community-independent\nFC indices of degree centrality and efficiency) ,  particu-\nlarly derived to characterize network segregation.  Com-\npared to HC  (Fig.  3 left column) ,  AD patients showed\nlower within-module degree,  a measure of connected-\nness inside the community,  in the hippocampus,  precu-\nneus,  and parietal cortices  (intraparietal cortex and\ninferior parietal lobule) ,  predominantly regions in the\nDN-CN community [51],  while bvFTD patients showed\nlower degree in many SVAN and striatum regions [33, \n95,  117].  Direct contrast between AD and bvFTD further\nshowed that bvFTD had lower degree in the insula than\nAD,  consistent the reciprocal model.  These differences\nimply a compromised nodal importance within its own\nnetwork. \n\nNevertheless,  perhaps contrary to our hypothesis,  this\ncomparison also highlighted some curious differences, \nnamely higher degree in the cingulum regions in byFTD\nand higher degree in the anterior/ventral mPFC in AD. \nWhile a speculative compensatory explanation,  as dis-\n\nbetween the DN and SVAN when these networks are\ncompromised by dementia pathologies.  Applying graph\ntheoretical measures on resting-state EEG data,  de Hann\nand colleagues [35] concluded that compared to controls\nwith subjective memory complaints,  the brain functional\norganization of AD was more random,  while that of\nFTD was more  (excessively)  regular,  possibly attributable\nto distinct pathologies.  It would be of interest for future\nstudies to examine if the specific modularity changes re-\nported here explain the opposite topological deviations\nfrom  small-worldness  that typically characterizes opti-\nmal networks,  amidst methodological variations between\nthe two studies  (e. g. ,  definition of control group and\nFTD diagnosis) . \n\nMore severe subcortical network topological damage in\nbvFTD\n\nSubcortical brain regions have been known to show se-\nlective,  early vulnerability to frontotemporal lobar de-\ngeneration  (FTLD)  pathology [93] resulting in functional\nnetwork alterations in byFTD [41,  53,  87,  117].  Here,  we\nfound that subcortical connectivity was disrupted espe-\ncially in bvFTD.  Compared to AD and HC,  bvFTD\nshowed most community dissimilarity in the SVAN\nmodule and subcortical module,  as a result of less segre-\ngated SVAN subsystems,   intrusion  of subcortical re-\ngions into cortical communities,  and the remarkable\nintegration of the striatum and thalamus regions.  Inter-\nestingly,  AD patients have higher integration in thalamus\nthan bvFTD patients.  Thalamic abnormality has been ar-\ngued to be crucial in early AD for its close circuitry with\nother parts of the episodic memory system  (the Papez\ncircuit,  [2])  and across the FTD spectrum for its putative\nkey role in regulating multiple cognitive,  motor,  and\nsocio-affective functions  (e. g. ,  atrophy [14]; ) .  In parallel, \nwithin-module degree and participation coefficient in\nmany striatum ROIs were altered  (both higher and\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nlower)  in byvFTD when compared to HC  (degree)  and\nAD  (participation coefficient) .  Compared to controls,  pa-\ntients with bvFTD have previously shown reduced func-\ntional connectivity in frontoinsular and basal ganglia\nnetworks [43];  volumetric changes in striatal and thal-\namic regions were also reported in bvFTD [59] and\nother FTD syndromes  (thalamus [14]; ) .  The cortico-\nstriatal-thalamic connections are essential to many fun-\ndamental cognitive processes such as cognitive control\n[54],  emotion regulation [64,  83],  and reward-decision\nmaking [40].  Their FC alterations and modular modifica-\ntions are consistent with deficits in socio-affective,  auto-\nnomic processing,  and executive function in bvFTD [38, \n89]. \n\nTo our knowledge,  this is the first study to show alter-\nations of subcortical structures in both nodal and modu-\nlar organization in bvFTD.  While more replications are\nneeded to ascertain the direction and functional implica-\ntions of the FC and organizational changes in the stri-\natum and thalamus,  finding from Jakabek and colleagues\n[59] suggested that these relationships might be\ndependent on regional structural connectivity.  Specific-\nally,  their bvFTD patients had overall lower subcortical\ngray matter volume than HC,  but striatal and thalamic\nregions with white matter connection to the medial pre-\nfrontal cortex,  unexpectedly had significantly larger vol-\nume,  possibly representing compensatory or maladaptive\nnetwork remodeling.  Such variations are likely to exert\ninfluences on their corresponding functional network\nprofiles. \n\nAlterations in integration and segregation of associative\nnetworks correlated with cognition and neuropsychiatric\nsymptom severity\n\nFinally,  we observed that brain regions showing group\ndifferences in network integration and segregation prop-\nerties demonstrated reliable association with cognitive\ndeficits and symptom severity across subtypes,  suggest-\ning that while the two subtypes have reciprocal clinical\nhenotypes and neural alterations,  some deficits vary\nquantitatively along a  dementia spectrum  instead of\nshowing stark qualitative differences,  some of which\nmight be better captured in between-network properties\n17,  119].  Across all patients,  better performance on at-\ntention was associated with higher integration  (nodal ef-\niciency)  in the right precuneus of the CN.  While\ndesignated as the control network regions,  precuneus\nas been argued to be dissociable from the core dorsal\nDN and form its own posterior memory network  (PMN) \nreflecting attentional and mnemonic processes such as\nnovelty and familiarity of the to-be-remembered items\n47],  memory [96],  and its retrieval [55].  Alterations of\nthe intra- and inter-network PMN FC was shown to dif-\nerentiate between normal and pathological  (AD)  aging\n\nPage 12 of 16\n\n (57,  63].  The linear positive association with an atten-\ntional test with a putative memory component [62,  112]\nis consistent with its putative functionality and further\nshowcased its purported sensitivity to disease status in\ndementia in general.  With more bvFTD patients in-\ncluded,  future studies can investigate if the precuneus or\nPMN,  considered separately of the DN,  has differential\ndiagnostic values  (e. g. ,  by examining interactive effect\nbetween diagnosis and network measures on outcomes) . \n\nFurthermore,  worse NPI severity  (higher score)  was as-\nsociated with lower modularity  (higher participation co-\nefficient)  in the left frontomedial cortices of the SVAN\nacross all AD and bvFTD patients.  As discussed above, \nSVAN seemed to evidence the most loss of distinctive-\nness between subsystems in our bvFTD group compared\nto the rest.  Consistently,  more cross-talk between the\nfrontomedial cortices of the SVAN  (dorsal anterior cin-\ngulate cortex,  dACC)  with other non-SVAN regions,  as\nindicated by higher participation coefficient,  may indi-\ncate excessive and disruptive inter-network communica-\ntion.  Notably,  we also found that higher NPI severity\nscores were associated with higher within-module degree\nin the left cingulate cortex of the CN.  In the context of\ncognitive control,  the dACC is responsible for mediating\nongoing behavioral adaptation by providing a continu-\nously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand\nto optimize future behavioral responses [36,  98].  While\nhigher degree of the CN typically indicates better net-\nwork integrity and predicts better cognition and disease\nsymptoms [29],  both AD and bvFTD evidenced a less\nsegregated CN community structure compared to HC\n (Fig.  4,  yellow) .  Similar to our perspective on the SVAN, \nbut now within a module,  higher connectedness between\na node and its topological neighbors in an aberrant net-\nwork may indicate loss of network distinctiveness rather\nthan the more beneficial network integration.  Since the\ntwo ROIs are very close to each other,  we speculate that\nthese organizational changes in the vicinity of the  (ACC\ntogether may reflect a unified inward-outward break-\ndown of the SVAN and CN in the two dementia sub-\ntypes that might be maladaptive than compensatory in\nnature,  leading to behavioral symptoms. \n\nLimitations and future directions\nThis study has a few limitations.  First,  our sample size of\nbvFTD patients was relatively smaller compared to the\nAD group,  although their clinical and demographical\nmight be impacted by the choice of brain parcellation\nhave been found across parcellations [1,  97],  one-\nscheme-fits-all sometimes risks oversimplification [5, \n113].

Neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated by the total Neuropsychiatric Inventory  (NPI)  severity residual scores were\nassociated with higher within-module degree in the left anterior cingulate cortex of the executive control network  (middle,  ICN-A_Cinga)  and\nhigher participation coefficient in the medial frontal cortex of the salience/ventral attention network  (ISVAN-A_FrMed)  across all patients\n\n20 21 22 23 . 24 25 26\nParticipation coefficient\nin ISVAN-A_FrMed\n\n@ bvFTD\n\ntheoretical measures,  we found that both groups demon-\nstrated distinct functional network topological alter-\nations in network integration and __ segregation/\ndistinctiveness,  complementing earlier findings on the\nopposite changes in FC strength between the two syn-\ndromes [53] by offering a different level of network de-\nscription.  In line with the reciprocal network proposal\n{117,  119],  both AD and bvFTD showed divergent\nbreakdown of modular structure in networks known to\nbe specifically affected in the respective syndrome:  AD\npatients showed greater vulnerability in the DN and CN\nwhile bvFTD patients showed greater disruptions in the\nSVAN and subcortical regions.  This study provides\nnovel insights into how decline in network integration, \nsegregation,  and distinctiveness encompassing both cor-\ntical and subcortical regions contribute to cognitive and\nbehavioral symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nDivergent alterations in network integration,  segregation, \nand modular structure in AD and bvFTD\n\nBrain networks consistently reported with reduced func-\ntional connectivity  (FC)  in AD and bvFTD are those\nwith the most neuropathologic changes and best associ-\nated with the symptom-deficit profiles [3,  4,  43,  61]. \nbvFTD patients consistently showed lower SVAN con-\nnectivity relative to AD [41,  117],  while early-onset and\nlate-onset AD patients showed lower DN connectivity\nrelative to bvFTD [21,  117].  These findings parallel the\ncharacteristic memory-executive dysfunction in AD [71]\nand social-emotional dysfunction in bvFTD [92].  Never-\ntheless,  these reduced within-network FC are only one\nfacet of the large-scale network structure alterations in\nneurodegenerative disorders.  Increasing number of stud-\nies have shown that transitions between a dedicated but\nisolated information processing mode  (i. e. ,  segregation) \nand a multimodal but costly communication mode  (i. e. \nintegration)  are essential for flexible and adaptive cogni-\ntion and behavior [11,  77,  99].  Our findings suggested\nthat the most common neurodegenerative disorders may\n\nfeature divergent disruptions in brain functional network\nintegration and segregation. \n\nIntegration\n\nAD patients showed reduced network integration mainly\nin the DN that is classically affected by AD pathology\n[82].  In contrast,  bvFTD patients showed lower network\nintegration  (degree centrality and nodal efficiency)  in\ncortical and subcortical areas belonging to the SVAN\n (insular,  thalamus and striatum) .  Head-to-head compari-\nsons between the two disorders further confirmed that\nthe DN and SVAN may be altered antagonistically in\nthese two dementia subtypes  (in particular lower degree\ncentrality and nodal efficiency in the SVAN but stronger\ndegree centrality in posterior cingulate cortex and intra-\narietal sulcus contrasting bvFTD against AD) ,  with AD\nand bvFTD attributable to divergent liberation and sup-\nression of the two networks,  as the reciprocal network\nmodel purports [119].  For instance,  failed feedback from\nthe DN  (cf [28])  might explain the correlation between\nigher FC in SVAN and symptoms of hyperactivity  (e. g. , \nagitation,  irritability,  aberrant motor behavior,  euphoria, \nand disinhibition)  in AD [7]. \n\nWe noted that the anterior and ventral medial pre-\nrontal cortices  (a/vmPFC) ,  typically core regions of the\nanterior DN,  evidenced higher nodal efficiency in AD\ncompared to bvFTD.  Past studies have repeatedly dem-\nonstrated the presence of subsystems within the DN, \nwith the posterior DN [61] and the subsystem involving\nthe medial temporal lobe [85] argued to be most affected\nby AD pathologies relative to other subsystems.  Our\nfindings thus may reflect this role as  cascade epicenter \nby the posterior DN in AD.  While a lack of measure of\nbiomarker status  (amyloid and tau;  see  Limitations and\nfuture directions )  prevented us from discussing the pos-\nsibility of sample heterogeneity,  the higher efficiency in\nthe anterior/ventral DN in AD than bvFTD could reflect\ncompensatory neural activity [20,  110].  Interestingly,  a/\nvmPFC is essential for socio-affective processing such as\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nemotional regulation [39];  its higher efficiency in AD,  to-\ngether with altered SVAN activity [7],  might account for\nincreased emotional contagion often reported in these\npatients [119]. \n\nModularity\n\nWhile a few fMRI studies have compared network alter-\nations between AD and bvFTD directly [43,  53,  117],  no\nstudy has yet proceeded to directly compare their net-\nwork community structure,  a succinct system-level de-\nscriptor of brain network structure [108,  110].  Applying\ngraph theoretical analysis and a resampling method to\nquantify module  (dis) similarity,  we found that both AD\nand bvFTD groups showed altered whole-brain commu-\nnity structure compared to HC.  The patient groups\nshowed significantly different community components\nfrom the HC both at the whole-brain and specific com-\nmunity levels  (Fig.  4) .  Normalized rand index also sug-\ngested that the two patient groups differed in their\ncommunity structures.  Of note,  this module dissimilarity\nbetween AD and bvFTD again demonstrated reciprocity\nat specific communities:  the similarity with the referent\ndefault-control community was the lowest in AD,  while\nthe similarity with the referent salience/ventral attention\ncommunity was the lowest in bvFTD. \n\nSegregation\n\nThe divergent network alterations in the two subtypes\nwere partly recapitulated in the community-derived\nnodal measures  (as opposed to community-independent\nFC indices of degree centrality and efficiency) ,  particu-\nlarly derived to characterize network segregation.  Com-\npared to HC  (Fig.  3 left column) ,  AD patients showed\nlower within-module degree,  a measure of connected-\nness inside the community,  in the hippocampus,  precu-\nneus,  and parietal cortices  (intraparietal cortex and\ninferior parietal lobule) ,  predominantly regions in the\nDN-CN community [51],  while bvFTD patients showed\nlower degree in many SVAN and striatum regions [33, \n95,  117].  Direct contrast between AD and bvFTD further\nshowed that bvFTD had lower degree in the insula than\nAD,  consistent the reciprocal model.  These differences\nimply a compromised nodal importance within its own\nnetwork. \n\nNevertheless,  perhaps contrary to our hypothesis,  this\ncomparison also highlighted some curious differences, \nnamely higher degree in the cingulum regions in byFTD\nand higher degree in the anterior/ventral mPFC in AD. \nWhile a speculative compensatory explanation,  as dis-\ncussed above,  may also apply here,  the interpretation of\nthe direction of the differences might be complicated by\nthe fact that the patient groups did not share the same\nnetwork structure.  For instance,  the DN subsystem B\nwas detached from the referent  (HC)  DN module in AD\n\nPage 11 of 16\n\nbut not bvFTD,  while the two SVAN subsystems were\nless  distinctive  in byFTD but not AD.  Another inter-\nesting possibility is the presence of further  subtyping \nwithin each syndrome.  For example,  further study may\nbenefit from considering a dysexecutive variant of AD\nwith predominant executive dysfunction symptoms [81]. \n\nIn addition,  compared to bvFTD,  AD patients showed\nhigher participation coefficient,  a measure of inter-\nnetwork connectedness,  in many referent CN regions, \nsuggestive of a loss of segregation between the DN and\nCN in AD.  Loss of DN and CN distinctiveness may re-\nflect declining network functional specialization or pro-\ncessing efficiency commonly observed in normal aging\n (24,  26],  which might be accelerated by AD risk factors\nsuch as the possession of APOE e4 gene [80].  Together, \nthese module-based findings complement our nodal FC\nresults to highlight the putative reciprocal relationship\nbetween the DN and SVAN when these networks are\ncompromised by dementia pathologies.  Applying graph\ntheoretical measures on resting-state EEG data,  de Hann\nand colleagues [35] concluded that compared to controls\nwith subjective memory complaints,  the brain functional\norganization of AD was more random,  while that of\nFTD was more  (excessively)  regular,  possibly attributable\nto distinct pathologies.  It would be of interest for future\nstudies to examine if the specific modularity changes re-\nported here explain the opposite topological deviations\nfrom  small-worldness  that typically characterizes opti-\nmal networks,  amidst methodological variations between\nthe two studies  (e. g. ,  definition of control group and\nFTD diagnosis) . \n\nMore severe subcortical network topological damage in\nbvFTD\n\nSubcortical brain regions have been known to show se-\nlective,  early vulnerability to frontotemporal lobar de-\ngeneration  (FTLD)  pathology [93] resulting in functional\nnetwork alterations in byFTD [41,  53,  87,  117].  Here,  we\nfound that subcortical connectivity was disrupted espe-\ncially in bvFTD.  Compared to AD and HC,  bvFTD\nshowed most community dissimilarity in the SVAN\nmodule and subcortical module,  as a result of less segre-\ngated SVAN subsystems,   intrusion  of subcortical re-\ngions into cortical communities,  and the remarkable\nintegration of the striatum and thalamus regions.  Inter-\nestingly,  AD patients have higher integration in thalamus\nthan bvFTD patients.  Thalamic abnormality has been ar-\ngued to be crucial in early AD for its close circuitry with\nother parts of the episodic memory system  (the Papez\ncircuit,  [2])  and across the FTD spectrum for its putative\nkey role in regulating multiple cognitive,  motor,  and\nsocio-affective functions  (e. g. ,  atrophy [14]; ) .  In parallel, \nwithin-module degree and participation coefficient in\nmany striatum ROIs were altered  (both higher and\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nlower)  in byvFTD when compared to HC  (degree)  and\nAD  (participation coefficient) .  Compared to controls,  pa-\ntients with bvFTD have previously shown reduced func-\ntional connectivity in frontoinsular and basal ganglia\nnetworks [43];  volumetric changes in striatal and thal-\namic regions were also reported in bvFTD [59] and\nother FTD syndromes  (thalamus [14]; ) .  The cortico-\nstriatal-thalamic connections are essential to many fun-\ndamental cognitive processes such as cognitive control\n[54],  emotion regulation [64,  83],  and reward-decision\nmaking [40].  Their FC alterations and modular modifica-\ntions are consistent with deficits in socio-affective,  auto-\nnomic processing,  and executive function in bvFTD [38, \n89]. \n\nTo our knowledge,  this is the first study to show alter-\nations of subcortical structures in both nodal and modu-\nlar organization in bvFTD.  While more replications are\nneeded to ascertain the direction and functional implica-\ntions of the FC and organizational changes in the stri-\natum and thalamus,  finding from Jakabek and colleagues\n[59] suggested that these relationships might be\ndependent on regional structural connectivity.  Specific-\nally,  their bvFTD patients had overall lower subcortical\ngray matter volume than HC,  but striatal and thalamic\nregions with white matter connection to the medial pre-\nfrontal cortex,  unexpectedly had significantly larger vol-\nume,  possibly representing compensatory or maladaptive\nnetwork remodeling.  Such variations are likely to exert\ninfluences on their corresponding functional network\nprofiles. \n\nAlterations in integration and segregation of associative\nnetworks correlated with cognition and neuropsychiatric\nsymptom severity\n\nFinally,  we observed that brain regions showing group\ndifferences in network integration and segregation prop-\nerties demonstrated reliable association with cognitive\ndeficits and symptom severity across subtypes,  suggest-\ning that while the two subtypes have reciprocal clinical\nhenotypes and neural alterations,  some deficits vary\nquantitatively along a  dementia spectrum  instead of\nshowing stark qualitative differences,  some of which\nmight be better captured in between-network properties\n17,  119].  Across all patients,  better performance on at-\ntention was associated with higher integration  (nodal ef-\niciency)  in the right precuneus of the CN.  While\ndesignated as the control network regions,  precuneus\nas been argued to be dissociable from the core dorsal\nDN and form its own posterior memory network  (PMN) \nreflecting attentional and mnemonic processes such as\nnovelty and familiarity of the to-be-remembered items\n47],  memory [96],  and its retrieval [55].  Alterations of\nthe intra- and inter-network PMN FC was shown to dif-\nerentiate between normal and pathological  (AD)  aging\n\nPage 12 of 16\n\n (57,  63].  The linear positive association with an atten-\ntional test with a putative memory component [62,  112]\nis consistent with its putative functionality and further\nshowcased its purported sensitivity to disease status in\ndementia in general.  With more bvFTD patients in-\ncluded,  future studies can investigate if the precuneus or\nPMN,  considered separately of the DN,  has differential\ndiagnostic values  (e. g. ,  by examining interactive effect\nbetween diagnosis and network measures on outcomes) . \n\nFurthermore,  worse NPI severity  (higher score)  was as-\nsociated with lower modularity  (higher participation co-\nefficient)  in the left frontomedial cortices of the SVAN\nacross all AD and bvFTD patients.  As discussed above, \nSVAN seemed to evidence the most loss of distinctive-\nness between subsystems in our bvFTD group compared\nto the rest.  Consistently,  more cross-talk between the\nfrontomedial cortices of the SVAN  (dorsal anterior cin-\ngulate cortex,  dACC)  with other non-SVAN regions,  as\nindicated by higher participation coefficient,  may indi-\ncate excessive and disruptive inter-network communica-\ntion.  Notably,  we also found that higher NPI severity\nscores were associated with higher within-module degree\nin the left cingulate cortex of the CN.  In the context of\ncognitive control,  the dACC is responsible for mediating\nongoing behavioral adaptation by providing a continu-\nously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand\nto optimize future behavioral responses [36,  98].  While\nhigher degree of the CN typically indicates better net-\nwork integrity and predicts better cognition and disease\nsymptoms [29],  both AD and bvFTD evidenced a less\nsegregated CN community structure compared to HC\n (Fig.  4,  yellow) .  Similar to our perspective on the SVAN, \nbut now within a module,  higher connectedness between\na node and its topological neighbors in an aberrant net-\nwork may indicate loss of network distinctiveness rather\nthan the more beneficial network integration.  Since the\ntwo ROIs are very close to each other,  we speculate that\nthese organizational changes in the vicinity of the  (ACC\ntogether may reflect a unified inward-outward break-\ndown of the SVAN and CN in the two dementia sub-\ntypes that might be maladaptive than compensatory in\nnature,  leading to behavioral symptoms. \n\nLimitations and future directions\nThis study has a few limitations.  First,  our sample size of\nbvFTD patients was relatively smaller compared to the\nAD group,  although their clinical and demographical\ncharacteristics were well matched.  Second,  our results\nmight be impacted by the choice of brain parcellation\nand its spatial resolution.  Although consistent results\nhave been found across parcellations [1,  97],  one-\nscheme-fits-all sometimes risks oversimplification [5, \n113].  Future work should focus on using individualized\nparcellations [25,  27] to derive and compare brain\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nnetwork topology.  Third,  while the group differences in\nnodal-wise graph theoretical measures did not survive\nmultiple comparison correction,  our key findings on the\nfunctional network organization  (community structures) \nwas not affected by this correction.  Related,  while our\npatient groups were comparable on overall FC strength, \nit will be very informative to systematically dissociate the\ncontribution of FC strength and true topological changes\nto the observed group differences in the brain network\nproperties [106].  Forth,  our participants were grouped\naccording to clinical diagnosis;  while we adopted a high\nstandard in our diagnosis and demonstrated their diver-\ngent clinical profiles,  uncertainty such as mislabelling\n (e. g. ,  due to clinical phenotype and pathology mismatch, \n{101])  may still be inevitable.  Future studies with\ndisease-specific biomarkers such as amyloid,  tau,  and\ncerebrovascular status will be important to studying dis-\nease heterogeneity [24 27].  Finally,  our study focused\nmainly on the differences between the two dementia\nsubtypes;  conversely,  studying their overlapping symp-\ntoms and the underlying neural substrates would be\nhighly informative,  an approach that has gained momen-\ntum in many neuropsychiatric conditions  (e. g. ,  [45,  70]) . \n\nIn conclusion,  we reported novel disease-specific dis-\nruptions in intrinsic functional network topology and\nmodularity in AD and bvFTD,  in particular highlighting\nthe divergence patterns of the two disorders in higher-\norder associative cortical networks  (default,  salience,  and\ncontrol)  and subcortical regions,  reinforcing the signifi-\ncance of network-based functional disorganization in\nmodulating cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. \nFuture longitudinal studies are needed to assess the\npathological,  genetic,  and environmental factors leading\nto the divergent changes in functional organization of\nthese two neurodegenerative disorders,  especially in the\nearly stage,  and the potential impact on network-based\nbreakdown along the disease continuum. \n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https: //doi\norg/10. 1186/s13195-020-00752-w. \n\nAdditional file 1:  Supplementary Table 1.

Interestingly,  a/\nvmPFC is essential for socio-affective processing such as\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nemotional regulation [39];  its higher efficiency in AD,  to-\ngether with altered SVAN activity [7],  might account for\nincreased emotional contagion often reported in these\npatients [119]. \n\nModularity\n\nWhile a few fMRI studies have compared network alter-\nations between AD and bvFTD directly [43,  53,  117],  no\nstudy has yet proceeded to directly compare their net-\nwork community structure,  a succinct system-level de-\nscriptor of brain network structure [108,  110].  Applying\ngraph theoretical analysis and a resampling method to\nquantify module  (dis) similarity,  we found that both AD\nand bvFTD groups showed altered whole-brain commu-\nnity structure compared to HC.  The patient groups\nshowed significantly different community components\nfrom the HC both at the whole-brain and specific com-\nmunity levels  (Fig.  4) .  Normalized rand index also sug-\ngested that the two patient groups differed in their\ncommunity structures.  Of note,  this module dissimilarity\nbetween AD and bvFTD again demonstrated reciprocity\nat specific communities:  the similarity with the referent\ndefault-control community was the lowest in AD,  while\nthe similarity with the referent salience/ventral attention\ncommunity was the lowest in bvFTD. \n\nSegregation\n\nThe divergent network alterations in the two subtypes\nwere partly recapitulated in the community-derived\nnodal measures  (as opposed to community-independent\nFC indices of degree centrality and efficiency) ,  particu-\nlarly derived to characterize network segregation.  Com-\npared to HC  (Fig.  3 left column) ,  AD patients showed\nlower within-module degree,  a measure of connected-\nness inside the community,  in the hippocampus,  precu-\nneus,  and parietal cortices  (intraparietal cortex and\ninferior parietal lobule) ,  predominantly regions in the\nDN-CN community [51],  while bvFTD patients showed\nlower degree in many SVAN and striatum regions [33, \n95,  117].  Direct contrast between AD and bvFTD further\nshowed that bvFTD had lower degree in the insula than\nAD,  consistent the reciprocal model.  These differences\nimply a compromised nodal importance within its own\nnetwork. \n\nNevertheless,  perhaps contrary to our hypothesis,  this\ncomparison also highlighted some curious differences, \nnamely higher degree in the cingulum regions in byFTD\nand higher degree in the anterior/ventral mPFC in AD. \nWhile a speculative compensatory explanation,  as dis-\n\nbvFTD patients was relatively smaller compared to the\nAD group,  although their clinical and demographical\nAD:  Alzheimer's disease;  APOE:  Apolipoprotein E;  a/vmPFC:  Anterior/\nventromedial prefrontal cortex;  bvFTD:  Behavioral variant frontotemporal\ndementia;  CDR:  Clinical Dementia Rating;  CN:  Control network; \n\nCSF:  Cerebrospinal fluid;  dACC:  Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex;  DN:  Default\n\nPage 13 of 16\n\n (mode)  network;  EOAD:  With early-onset Alzheimer's disease;  FC:  Functional\nconnectivity;  FTLD:  Frontotemporal lobar degeneration;  HC:  Healthy control; \nMMSE:  Mini-Mental State Examination;  MoCA:  Montreal Cognitive\nAssessment;  MRI:  Magnetic resonance imaging;  NPI:  Neuropsychiatric\nInventory;  PMN:  Posterior memory network;  SVAN:  Salience/ventral attention\nnetwork;  WM:  White matter\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to our patients and their families for their generous\nparticipation in this study. \n\nAuthors  contributions\n\nASLN,  JW,  NK,  and JHZ designed the study.

        "Introduction": "atrophy and functional disruptions within two major intrinsic brain networks,  namely the default network and the\nsalience network,  respectively.  It remains unclear if inter-network relationships and whole-brain network topology\nare also altered and underpin cognitive and social-emotional functional deficits.\nAlzheimer s disease  (AD)  and frontotemporal dementia\n (FTD)  remain two of the most common causes of de-\nmentia under the age of 65.  AD classically presents with\nimpairment in short-term memory and visuospatial abil-\nity,  sometimes with atypical deficits in other domains in\nyounger patients [81].  Frontotemporal dementia fre-\nquently presents with behavioral and personality change, \nknown as behavioral variant FTD  (bvFTD)  [89].  AD fea-\ntures typical atrophy in the posterior hippocampal-\ncingulo-temporal-parietal default mode network  (DN) \n (50,  94].  In contrast,  bvFTD relates to atrophy in the\nfrontoinsular-striatal salience/ventral attention network\n (SVAN)  [94,  95].  Increasingly,  diagnostic uncertainty in\nthe early stages of disease when minimal atrophy is seen\non structural neuroimaging [58] calls for more sensitive\nimaging phenotype.  The network-based neurodegenera-\ntion hypothesis proposes that neurodegenerative diseases\ntarget large-scale neural networks and regional vulner-\nability varies along network topology [86,  94].  Hence, \ncharting the convergence and divergence in the alter-\nations of brain network-based metrics caused by these\ndementia subtypes could help improve imaging marker\nsensitivity for differential diagnosis and symptoms map-\nping [9,  66,  72,  118]. \n\nBrain functional connectivity  (FC)  derived from spon-\ntaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent  (BOLD)  sig-\nnals [12] during resting-state  (or task-free)  functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging  (f[MRI)  has been proposed\nto be a network-sensitive imaging method [49].  Func-\ntionally connected brain regions show highly synchron-\nous slow fluctuation in BOLD signals and form\nfunctionally specialized clusters known as intrinsic con-\nnectivity networks,  including the DN and SVAN [100, \n118].  Importantly,  functional connectivity alterations are\ndifferent between neuropsychiatric and non-pathological\naging [22,  56,  74],  as well as among different dementia\nsubtypes paralleling their atrophy signatures [67].  In\nearly landmark studies,  compared to well-matched\nhealthy participants,  AD patients showed lower DN con-\nnectivity to posterior parieto-occipital regions with in-\ntensified SVAN connectivity,  while bvFTD patients\nshowed attenuated SVAN connectivity most notably in\nthe frontoinsular-striatal region with enhanced DN con-\nnectivity [117].  Furthermore,  disease  epicenter -based\nFC modeling was able to predict regional atrophy\n\nseverity in each of the five distinct neurodegenerative\ndisorders [116].  Studies like these underscored the value\nof studying network-specific FC.  However,  multiple\nathological mechanisms may co-exist [116],  and these\nathological changes may be associated with other FC\nroperties in dementia.  First,  alterations in inter-\nnetwork FC are also frequently reported [17].  In particu-\nar,  the regulatory relationship between the SVAN and\nDN  ( anti-correlations )  is believed to be critical for nor-\nmal cognition and may be compromised in dementia\n23,  75].  Second,  FC aberration can appear in brain net-\nworks outside the two reciprocating networks,  such as\nthe frontoparietal network associated with cognitive con-\ntrol,  attention,  and working memory,  as previously re-\norted in bvFTD [41].  Third,  structural and functional\ninsults in subcortical regions have been reported and\nmay be useful for tracking progression [6] and subtyping\n18].  Until now,  although a number of studies have\nattempted to incorporate these phenomena into existing\ndisease models by targeting subsets of networks or one\ndementia subtype [42,  90],  few has employed a whole-\nbrain connectome-based,  multiple-syndrome approach. \n\nGraph theoretical analyses on whole-brain functional\nconnectome are able to quantify complex brain network\ntopology including integration,  modularity,  and effi-\nciency using both nodal and global indices [19].  Com-\nmunity structure analysis characterizes how network\nnodes cluster into densely interconnected  communities \nto support behavioral and cognitive functions [31].  It has\ngarnered extensive use in investigating neuropsychiatric\ndisorders [15,  108].  For instance,  comparing patients\nwith early-onset AD  (EOAD)  and bvFTD [43],  EOAD\nshowed more severe global functional network alter-\nations,  while bvFTD showed relatively preserved global\nfunctional brain architecture but more focal alterations\nin nodal FC.  Still,  existing studies did not consider inter-\nnetwork connections,  subcortical regions,  and brain\nmodular structure simultaneously and investigated how\nbrain network topological features contribute to cogni-\ntive and behavioral symptoms between AD and bvFTD\n (34,  53].  Such studies are also severely under-\nrepresenting the Asian cohort,  where aging and demen-\ntia rates are among the worlds  highest. \n\nTo address these gaps,  we applied whole-brain connec-\ntome approach to a well-characterized Asian cohort.  We\nhypothesized that AD and bvFTD would show divergent\n\nNg et al.  Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2021)  13: 13\n\nabnormalities in the topological organization of func-\ntional brain networks extending into subcortical and\ninter-network connections.  Patients with byFTD would\nhave more disrupted modular structure in the SVAN\nwhile patients with AD would show greater loss of net-\nwork modularity in the DN.  Both disorders would have\ndamaged subcortical modular structure.  We also pre-\ndicted that the SVAN and subcortical topological\nchanges would relate to behavioral problems while the\ntopological changes in the other higher-order cognitive\nnetworks such as DN and frontoparietal control network\nwould be associated with cognitive impairment.\nwhere k, ,  is the number of edges connecting the node i\nto other nodes in the module n,  k,  is the average of ky, \nover all nodes in the module n,  and o, ,  is the standard\ndeviation of the intra-modular degrees in the module n. \n\nParticipation coefficient at each node i,  on the other\nhand,  provides a measure of inter-modular connectivity\nand is defined as: \n\nNK \\2\nP; =1- a\nyy  (i) \nwhere k;  is the total degree of the node i in the entire\nnetwork. \n\nModularity\n\nModularity refers to the degree to which modules/com-\nmunities dissociate from each other and is a particularly\nimportant topological attribute for functional brain net-\nworks [46].  To examine the extent to which patient\ngroups reorganized their network community structures\nrelative to HC,  we calculated the similarity of the group-\nlevel community partition between patient group and\nHC using the adjusted rand index [88] and a resampling\nmethod.  We first resampled 20 subgroups from each\ngroup by randomly selecting 10 subjects with replace-\nment in keeping with our focus on some representative\ngroup-level community structure based on _ the\n\nPage 6 of 16\n\nconsensus assignments across individuals,  instead of dir-\nect comparison of individual modularity structures.

        "Discussion": "The clinical signs in this patient were\nconsistent with FCMS.  This condition,  which\nmay be congenital or acquired,  persistent or\nintermittent,  includes severe anarthria,  loss\nof voluntary muscular functions of the face\nand tongue,  and impaired mastication and\nswallowing,  with preservation of reflex and\nautonomic functions.   The aetiology of FCMS\nis heterogeneous:  vascular insults in adult-\nhood,  such as bilateral subsequent strokes; \ninfections of the CNS,  such as herpes simplex\nencephalitis or acute disseminated encepha-\nlomyelitis.  FCMS can be congenital,  owing to\nbilateral dysgenesis of the perisylvian region. \nFCMS as a manifestation of epilepsy has been\ndescribed nearly exclusively in childhood.    \n\nThe clinical picture of our patient was\ninitially attributed to an overdose of oxycodone. \nOnly consciousness and not the facial,  phar-\nyngeal and lingual and mastication move-\nments,  however,  improved with\ndiscontinuation of the treatment.  Uraemic\naetiology could not be implicated,  as there\nwas no change in the renal status during the\nwhole episode because the patient was reg-\nularly haemodialysed. \n\nNCSE was diagnosed only by EEG,  which\nshowed an electroencephalographic pattern\ncompatible with the diagnosis.

        "Results": "lateral temporal lobe stroke, * * the part of the\nhippocampus that causes severe amnesia\nremains unknown.  Here,  we report the case\nof a patient who developed severe antero-\ngrade amnesia and minimal retrograde\namnesia after a focal haemorrhage in the\nhippocampal body. \n\nA 72-year-old right-handed man was\nadmitted to the International Medical\nCenter of Japan,  Tokyo,  Japan,  in May 1999\nbecause of acute memory impairment.  A few\ndays before admission,  he started forgetting\nwhat he had done and said several minutes\nearlier,  and he could no longer name nearby\nobjects.  On admission,  he was disoriented as\nto the year,  month and day,  and could not\nrecall the names of objects that he had been\ntold to remember a few minutes earlier.  His\nsymptoms continued and were persistent\nl month later.  MRI Tl-weighted images\n\nPostscript\n\n1 month after onset showed a haemorrhage\nin the left hippocampal body and in part of\nthe hippocampal tail.  The lesion included\nCAI,  CA2 and CA3,  the dentate gyrus and\nsubiculum  (fig 1) ,  and extended subcortically\nin the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\nA neuropsychological evaluation was car-\nried out from 34 to 40 days after onset.  The\nWechsler Memory  Scale-Revised score\nshowed that verbal and delayed memory\nindices were markedly low,  whereas the\nvisual memory index was relatively preserved\n (attention and concentration 79,  verbal\nmemory 61,  visual memory 79,  general\nmemory 65 and delayed recall 55) .  A com-\nparison of the delayed test raw score total  (II) \nwith the first test raw score total  (1)  implied\nthat both encoding and_ retrieval were\nimpaired for verbal memory  (II/I 0/6,  full\nscore 58/58) ,  whereas retrieval was mainly\nimpaired for visual memory  (II/I 6/33,  full\nscore 47/47) .  The Benton Visual Retention\nTest score showed that both immediate figure\nreproduction  (7/10)  and reproduction after a\n15s delay  (3/10)  were impaired.  Delayed\nreproduction was also poor in the Rey-\nOsterreith Complex Figure Test  (copying 36/\n36,  30 min delay 6/36) .  Conversely,  scores for\nthe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \nRevised were normal  (verbal intelligence\nquotient  (IQ)  105,  performance IQ 121 and\nfull-scale IQ 114) .  Subtest scores for digit\nspan  (9/19;  forward 4 and backward 4)  and\narithmetic  (6/19) ,  however,  were relatively\nlow.  Digit span forward was also 4 when\npresented visually on a personal computer.\nterm memory or working memory. \n\nRemote memory was assessed with an\nautobiographical memory interview and with\nthe specific questions as described below.  The\npatient could recall autobiographical episodes\nwell,  but could not remember public events\n2 years before onset.  For example,  he remem-\nbered the British royal wedding of Princess\nDiana and Prince Charles in 1985,  but did not\nremember Diana s death in August 1997. \nFurthermore,  he remembered the Nagano\nWinter Olympics in February 1998,  the\nKobe earthquake in January 1995 and the\nTokyo subway sarin gas attack in March\n1995.  To determine whether there was a\ntemporal gradient in his past memory loss, \nwe gave the patient an 80-question multiple-\nchoice questionnaire on public events during\nthe four decades from 1950 to 1989,  divided\ninto four sections with 20 questions for every\n10 years.  He showed a slight temporal\ngradient in these sections,  but all these scores\nwere above the normal mean  (percentage\ncorrect  (normal mean for +70-year-olds, \n\nD) *:  1950s,  95  (53. 7,  5. 45) ;  1960s,  85  (55. 3, \n4. 83) ;  1970s,  75  (58. 5,  5. 05) ;  1980s,  70  (66. 8, \n4. 94) ) . \n\nThe patient profile was rated as follows:   (1) \nsevere anterograde amnesia that affected\nverbal memory more than visual memory; \n (2)  minimal retrograde amnesia for the\noccurrence of public events over the 2 years\nbefore onset,  with temporally graded event\nmemory loss over the preceding 20 years;  and\n (3)  impaired short-term memory. \n\nThis patient showed severe encoding and\nretrieval deficits in verbal memory.  This can\noccur because of a unilateral left hippocampal\nlesion.  A comparison of the reported cases\nshows that bilateral lesions of the hippocam-\npus or medial temporal lobe can cause\nmoderate to severe anterograde amnesia.  \nExamination of our patient suggested that\ndamage to the unilateral  (left)  hippocampal\nPostscript\n\n1197\n\nMRIT1  weighted axial  (A, B)  and coronal  (C-E)  images 1 month after onset showed a high-intensity area,  suggesting a haemorrhage in the\n\nfigyre 1\nle#t hippocampus.  The\n\nlesion included cornus ammonis 1-3,  dentate pris and subiculum,  and extended subcortically in the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\nThe anterior part of the hippocampus that is,  amygdala,  entorhinal cortex and hippocampal head appears intact. \n\nbody  (CA1-3,  dentate gyrus)  and subiculum\nwas enough to result in severe anterograde\namnesia.  As no case report has described\ncircumscribed damage to the amygdala, \nhippocampal head and entorhinal cortex,  it\nis yet to be clarified whether these anterior\nlesions alone can cause severe anterograde\namnesia. \n\nRetrograde amnesia was minimal in our\npatient,  although a detailed evaluation of his\npast memory showed a slight temporal\ngradient in the knowledge of events over\nthe preceding 20 years.  Studies on patients\nwith reported amnesia with hippocampal\nlesions suggested that severe retrograde\namnesia was caused by extensive damage to\nthe hippocampal formation    or to additional\ntemporal lobe structures.  That our patient\nshowed minimal retrograde amnesia with\nsparing of the amygdala and hippocampal\nhead is consistent with this view. \n\nAnother possibility is that the anterior part\nof the hippocampus  (hippocampal head and\n\nentorhinal cortex)  is more associated with\nextensive retrograde amnesia than the hip-\npocampal body.  As the entorhinal cortex\nprojects to the medial thalamus,  whereas\nthe subiculum  (posterior hippocampus lesion\nin our patient)  has connections to the\nanterior thalamic nuclei,   it is rational to\ncompare associated amnesic symptoms\nbetween the two lesions.  Patients with a\nlesion limited to the anterior hippocampus\nwould thus tend to show the involvement of\nthis area in retrograde memory. \n\nOur patient also showed a reduced digit\nspan,  which indicated auditory and visual \nverbal short-term memory impairment.  Few\ncase reports have referred to digit span in\ntemporal lobe amnesia.  One possible expla-\nnation for the reduced digit span is that the\nhaemorrhage affected extensive areas in the\ntemporal and parietal lobes.\nobserved | year earlier.
