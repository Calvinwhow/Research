' Surprisingly, this usually does not occur after deliberate endovascular ACoA occlusion, which is occa- sionally performed to reduce the high recurrence rate of broad-based ACoA aneurysms treated by coiling. * We present a case of bilateral fornix infarction and Korsakoff dementia after coil embolization and parent vessel occlusion of a large ACoA aneurysm. We emphasize the underlying anatomy of a poorly known perforator, the subcallosal artery (SubCA) . Case report A 47-year-old man was admitted for a Hunt and Hess grade 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large, broad-based ACoA aneurysm at the right Al A2 junction, which was uneventfully coiled. Six months later, significant recanalization occurred (figure, A) . Clipping was refused by the patient, who opted for endovascular retreatment. Given the absence of obvious perforators and well-developed Al segments, the ACoA was deliberately occluded with a good angiographic result (figure, BD) . Despite the absence of focal neurologic deficits, persistent confusion and memory impairment was observed. MRI showed bilateral infarcts of the anterior fornix, septum pellucidum, and corpus callosum (CC) genu (figure, E and F) . Neuropsychological assessment revealed severe anterograde and moderate retrograde amnesia, paramnesias, dysphoria, and a dysexecutive syndrome, characteristic for Korsakoff dementia. Despite intensive rehabilitation, only minor progress was observed 24 months later.

'* Such a complication is rare after endovascular obliteration of a broad-based ACoA aneurysm with intentional ACoA occlusion. On average, there are 6 ACoA perforators arising from the posterior aspect of the artery. They can be classified into 3 groups according to the territory they supply*: 1) chiasmatic, 2) hypothalamic, and 3) subcallosal. The absence of ischemia after occlusion of the 2 former relates to dual supply from branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) . The anterior subcallosal region, on the other hand, has no collateral supply and is vascularized exclusively by a single ACoA perforator, the subcallosal artery (SubCA) , which vascularizes the anterior columns of the fornix bilaterally, the rostrum and genu of CC, the Neurology: Clinical Practice 1 September 2012 www. neurology. org/cp Fornix infarction and Korsakoff dementia after coiling of a large anterior communicating artery aneurysm 261 262 Pascal John Mosimann et al. septum pellucidum, and the anterior commissure. One group previously acknowledged its importance by renaming the ACoAS the amnesic syndrome of the SubCA. The SubCA, despite being the largest perforator, remains a small terminal artery (0. 5 mm on average) . Although it usually remains angiographically occult, one should always assume it to be present. Situations where preoperative nonvisualization may be reassuring are when a full-sized MACC or azygos ACA are present, since these directly supply the SubCA territory. This relates to the differential development of their common embryologic precursor, the median rostral artery, which basically develops into 1 of 3 mutually exclusive variants: the SubCA, the MACC, or the azygos ACA. Although the 2 former share an identical cisternal course, the MACC is larger and longer and extends more dorsally and posteriorly toward the splenium. Conversely, the SubCA terminates before or at the genu. It can therefore be viewed as a hypoplastic MACC, explaining the more limited, yet functionally catastrophic infarction pattern associated with its occlusion. * The risk of ACoAS is relatively high after surgery of ACoA aneurysms. One consecutive series of 48 patients reports an ACoAS rate >80% when the ACoA is trapped and >15% when the ACoA is preserved and the aneurysm selectively clipped. ' Intentional endovascular ACoA occlusion, on the other hand, is commonly performed with impunity to treat wide- necked ACoA aneurysms when 2 Al segments and no ACoA perforators are identified. * The degree of occlusion after endovascular ACoA obliteration, however, is probably not as tight as presumed. Some residual nonopacified flow may still fill the SubCA from the edges of the ACoA bordering the protruding coil mass. In large aneurysms, a more surgical type of ACoA occlusion may occur due to a wider prolapsing coil mass, thereby increasing the risk of SubCA infarction. Stenting of the ACoA rather than parent artery occlusion may reduce the risk of SubCA occlusion and Korsakoff dementia, as well as aneurysmal recurrence, although this remains to be shown for broad-based aneurysms >10 mm. Surgery might also be considered when the dome projects anteriorly. REFERENCES 1. Gade A. Amnesia after operations on aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery. Surg Neurol 1982; 18: 46-49. 2.

K. tReceived 9 March 1993: accepted ? June 1993) Abstract This paper prescnis a case of discrete thalamic infarction which damaged various structures in the region of the left thalamus. Localisation of the lesion was confirmed by MRI scanning. From the localisation of the lesion it was concluded that damage had been inflicted on the hippocampal pathway, the amygdalar pathway, and the pathway from perirhinal cortex to the dorso- medial thalamic nucleus. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed a severe verbal memory deficit on anterograde tests comparable with that shown by alcoholic Wernicke-Korsakofl paticnts. In contrast performance on non-verbal memory measures was normal. Performance on retrograde ammesia lests indicated near-normal performance. A final finding was that memory for temporal information was impaired for both verbal and non-verbal information but only on anterograde tests, The data provide support for the view that a lesion in the anterior thalamus can produce amnesia if il compromises the hippocampal pathway and cither the amygdalar pathway or that arising from the perirhinal cortex and terminating in the dorsu-media! aucleus of the thalamus. On the basis of evidence from other studies i is conchided that the most likely interpretation is that the lesion must compromise the hippocampal and perirhinal cortex pathways. The pattern of memory impairment is described in some detail and these provide a basis for discussing the role of diencephalic structures in themory performance. IT 18 WELL FSTABLISIND that damage to the midline diencephalon can produce a severe and persistent amnesia [t7, 25]. However, the exact nature of the lesion required to produce this diencephalic amnesia remains a matter of debate and further research. Investigation in this area is relatively difficult because the diencephalon is un anatomically complex structure and the majority of diencephalic amnesics reported, such as those with Wernicke--K orsakoff Syndrome (WKS) , have rather exlensive lesions including functionally significant damage to the frontal cortex [sce 17 for a recent review]. Moreover, as GRAFF-RADFORD et al. [8] have pointed out, most accounts of diencephalic amnesia, other than those involving WKS patients, are deficient vither in terms of ncuropsychological testing, neuroanatomical data, or bath. GRrate-RADFORD ef al. have recently published important new evidence concerning the neural basis of diencephalic amnesia, They studied four patients who suffered bilateral thalamic infarctions using both nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR} scanning and extensive neuropsychological testing. Two of the patients suffered permanent and severe memory loss asa result of their lesions while the other two patients had no long-term memory difficulties. They concluded, on the basis of their own and other studies (e. g. Ref. [26]) , that the lesion involvement of the perirhinal cortical projection in memory impairments arising from damage in the anterior thalamic region seems quite probable (see SyuiRi and ZOLA-MORGAN [24]) . The present study describes a patient who suffered a discrete thalamic infarction which damaged the thalamus in the anterior position identitied by Grarr-RabDUORD ef al- thus providing an important test of these authors conclusions concerning the minimal iesion required [or diencephalic anmmesia. Moreover, investigation of this patient enabled an investigation of the functional character of diencephalic amnesia uncontaminated by the influence of additional frontal disturbance. CASE REPORT In November 1989 J. R. , a 48-year-old right-handed engineer, suffered a brief period of confusion and visual disturbance. Immediately following the incident he experienced marked memory difficulties which included a mild nominal dysphasia. An MRI scan revealed a disercte left thalamic infarction which is illustrated in Fig. i. ft can be seen that the lesion directly intersects the mamillothalamic tract and that there are also lesions in the dorso- medial nucleus and, to a lesser degree, in the ventro-lateral and centro-median nuclei. There was no evidence of any lesions elsewhere. The cause of the infuretion is not clear although it may be significant that J. R. had just recovered from a particularly severe Yersinia infection and had been indulging in vigorous exercise over a considerable period.

There were four condilians cach involving different sets of word pairs: Rote learning (RL) . learning mediated by inmages previded by the eaperimenter (Pi. learning mediated by self-generated images USG) , and learning mediated by experimenter supplied verbal information ( M) }. J. R2s performance on this task was compared with the WKS patients reported in Ref. [10] and a group of seven control subjects with a mean age of 50. 8 years, mean 1Q (NART) IIL. 3. The data are shown in Fig. 2 and show that J. RJs performance is somewhat better than WKS paticats in both RL and VM conditions although, in comparison with controls he is markedly impaired.

Hall of the photographs were of the British countryside and the remainder depicted scenes fram a foreign countryside. Subjects were told to look at each picture and decide whether each picture showed a scene from either home or abroad. Following presentation of the last picture subjects were then given a retention test. Each trial of the retention test involved presentation of four photographs und the subject had to pick out the target. Each array comprised the target, a mirror image of the target, plus two pictures of a novel scene une of which was the mirror image of the other, LR. s performance un this task was compared with 30 subjects (mean age 31. 5 years) and the 10 WKS patients reported in [7] Recognition was judged correct if the subject chose either the Largel or its mirror imag Spati nd was measured as dl\" u discrimination was vorrect if the target was selected and measured using the 2 score procedure used in the ALJ.

This presents a similar analytical problem to the list discrimination paradigm (see Appendix) because robahility of making a given number of correct answers is not constant bul varies with the total number of ded responses made. Accordingly, the dead, mode, and date scores were ull converted into 7 scores using the same formula as used in the analysis of the list discrimination tasks. Subjects performance on each component of the test is summarised in Table | and it can be seen that J. R. s performance on all components of the test is indistinguishable from controls while WKS patients exhibit substantial deficits DISCUSSION JR. suffered a thalamic stroke which resulted in a discrete lesion of the left thalamus. Examination of the MRI scans indicated that, although small, this infarction intersected the marnillothalamic tract, produced substantial damage to the dorso-medial thalamic nucleus, and caused lesser damage to the ventro-lateral and centro-median nuclei. GRATI-RADFORD ef al. [8], following the work of MIsHKIN [12], concluded that severe memory loss following damage to the thalamus required 4 lesion which compromised both the hippocampal and amygdalar pathways and that this form of damage was most likely to occur in the region of the anterior and dorso-medial thalamic nuclei. However, as noted earlier, it is also possible to argue that a lesion in this region is disruptive to memory because it interferes with projections from (he perirhinal cortex to the dorso-medial thalamus a pathway which takes the same route as that arising from the amygdala. Either way Case J. R. therefore provides a very good test of whether a lesion likely to compromise these pathways provides a sufficicnt condition for amnesia. Assessing the extent of J. R. s memory deficit is complicated by the fact that this lesion is present only on the left side. IL is not appropriate, therefore, to consider whether J. R. has a global amnesia because this would not be expected with a unilateral lesion. Instead one must consider whether his verbal memory impairment is characteristic of amnesia. The data from the above experiments suggest that J. R. docs have a severe verbal memory deficit. On the 46 A. J.

No such improvement is seen in amnesic pationts with presumed bilateral lesions when the same test is used [10]. so J.

It should be stressed that J. R. s impairment on temporal discrimination does not appear to be a more general deficit in discrimination per se because he performs well on tests on spatial discrimination. Nor can this be a test sensit- ivity artefact because control data indicate little difference between the temporal and spatial tasks, The demonstration of impaired temporal discrimination in case J. R. is of considerable THALAMIC AMNESIA 49 interest because this patient has no sign of frontal involvement either in terms of MRI scan data or neuropsychological testing. Impaired memory for temporal order in the presence of normal recognition memory has generally been considered an indication of frontal impairment. J. R. s marked deficit in memory for temporal context indicates that a deticit of this kind does not require a frontal leston a conclusion borne oul by two other recent studics of amnesics with only sub-cortical lesions [4, 18]. Tt is also of note that J. R. s left-sided lesion interferes with temporal context judgments for abstract designs which, as we have already noted. show normal levels of recognition. This normal recognition can be assumed to arise from intact right hemisphere function and, asa result, there are some grounds to expect normal memory for the temporal context as well. MILNER ef al. [11] examined the performance of right and left frontal patients on a recency task and found thal recency judgements were material specific. With verbal material only patients with left frontal removals showed a deficit whereas with abstract designs only right frontal removals caused a deficit. Why then does J. R. show a temporal order deficit for abstract materials when he only has a ieft sided lesion and, in all respects his neuropsychological performance is that of a patient with a left-lateralised Icsion? One possibility is that J. R. s deficit in temporal context memory has a different origin to that found in frontal patients. It has been proposed that impaired memory for temporal order can arise either through some failure to enocde the information needed for a subsequent temporal discrimination, an inability to retrieve information about temporal context appropriately, or both [4, 18]. As well as showing little evidence of retrograde amnesia per se, results from the Dead or Alive test indicate (hat J. R. performs normally when making temporal judgments about pre-existing memories. This strongly suggests that J. R. s impairment on anterograde measures of temporal context memory represents and encoding deficit. In contrast, the impairment shown by Irontal patients in the Milner ef a/. study may represent a retrieval deficit. A possible reconciliation, therefore, is that the encoding of temporal order information may be a left lateralised diencephalic function, a conclusion consistent with much of the lateralisation literature [5], whereas retrieval of this information may be lateralised according to the material involved. Furthermore, by implication, J. R. s good performance on spatial memory Lasks employing both verbal and non-verbal materials is consistent with a preserved right-lateralised spatial encoding function. it is also useful to compare the pattern of deficits evident in case I. R. with those found in other examples of amnesia following discrete thalamic lesions. J. R. s severe verbal memory deficit in the presence of gencrally unimpaired intellect is consistent with other studies (e. g. Refs [ 34. [25] and [29]) . The literature is less consistent as 10 whether retrograde amnesia is aconsistent Icature of thalamic amnesia with some studies indicating that it is and others that it is not [17]. J. R. did not appear to have any obvious impairment but caution must be exerted here because J. R. s preserved right-sided function may have ameliorated any potential retrograde deficits caused by his lesion. In conclusion, case JR. supports the hypothesis of Grafi-Radford er al. that a relatively small lesion of the thalamus can cause a severe anterograde impairment of memory as long as that lesion interferes with the hippocampal pathway and either the amygdalar pathway or that arising from the perirhinal cortex and terminating in the dorso-medial nucleus (from the examination of other evidence we consider it is likely to be the latter that is critical) . It also illustrates how anterograde memory loss is a particularly likely outcome of thalamic infarction in the anterior",

J. PARKIN ef al. amygdalar circuits of the limbic system [12]. Hippocampal circuit structures include the mamillary bodics and the mamillothalamic tract. Amygdalar components include the ventroamygdalofugal pathway and dorsomedial thalamic nucleus. In addition the same study showed, using autoradiographic studies of two monkeys, that a component of the ventroamygdalofugal pathway, while passing through the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, runs immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract before lerminating in dorsomedial thalamic nucleus. The two patients studied by Grarr-Raprorp et al, who developed amnesia both had lesions in this area and the authors concluded that the reason for the severe memory deficit was the damage to both circuits of the limbic system. Furthermore it was stressed that the proximity of these two circuits in the anterior thalamus explained why a smail lesion in this region of the brain could have such a disruptive effect on memory. It should be noted, however, that it may not be the amygdalar circuit that is critical to memory function. Rather it may be disruption of the projection from the perirhinal cortex, which lies adjacent to the amygdala, that is critically invelved in causing memory impairment. This projection runs along the same route as the amygdala pathway and, given various lines of evidence that amygdalar lesions do not underlie amnesic impairment, the critical Spatial fist discrimination.

Evidence that the lest is sensitive to amnesic impairment in is indicated by the poor performance of the WKS patients Remote memory, JR. was given the Dead or Alive Test (9) . The materials comprised the names of 40 well known personalities who have been famous over the past 50 years. The names were in large print on three sheels of Ad paper. Ten of the personalities were still alive and 10 dicd in each of the decades 1960 1969. 1970 1979, and 1980 1989. OF the 10 that died within cach decade four were killed and six died of natural cause: Subjects were required to read each name aloud and say whether or net the person was alive. A don't know option was also allowed. Por personalities correctly identified as dead the subject was further required to indicate the mode of death (natural causes: killect) and estimate when the person died.

RUGGERI !, C, GUARIGLIA 2: 3, U. SABATINI > Amnesia is usually associated with bilateral medial temporal lesions. Only few cases of amnesia associated with isolated frontal white matter lesion are described in literature, while the role of frontal-striatal-thalamic circuit in cognition is still elusive. The aim of this case report was to bring a contribution to the role of frontal-striatal-thalamic pathways in human memory. The authors describe the neuropsychological longitudinal profile of a 40-year-old man that developed amnesia after removal of an asymptomatic colloid cyst of the septum pellucidum and third ventricle that damaged the right frontal subcortical white matter, sparing the fornix and other limbic regions. The patient showed working memory deficit, anterograde amnesia for ver- bal and non verbal materials and mild frontal executive deficits. A follow-up evaluation 13 months after onset showed only some mild improvements in his memory functions. The authors hypothesize that amnesia may have been caused by impairment of working mem- ory and encoding process as a consequence of a lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, that disrupted the projections to the neos- triatum and the thalamus. These observations suggest that the frontal-striatal-thalamic path- ways might have a crucial role in working memory and encoding processes, and also that one mechanism for memory impair- ments in white matter diseases is the discon- Received on October 7, 2008.

The authors suggested that amnesia was due to disconnection of the thalamofrontal circuit and of the anterior thalamic radiations. The role of lesions of the frontal subcorti- cal white matter in developing amnesia is discussed, regarding frontal-striatal-thalamic pathways, and suggesting a possible role of this neural circuit in working memory and encoding processes. Case report Mr A. A. was a right-handed, 40-year-old male, that underwent a computed tomography (CT) examination during clinical examination for bilateral retinitis, that showed a cyst in the third ventricle and in the right Monro s foramen. The patient underwent surgery with a right frontal transventricular approach, where 94 MINERVA PSICHIATRICA, AMNESIA AFTER RIGHT FRONTAL SUBCORTICAL LESION a colloid cyst in the septum pellucidum and a second smaller cyst in the third ventricle, located also under the Monro s foramen, were successfully removed. Before surgery, A. A. did not suffer any memory, cog- nitive or movement disorders, while after he showed spatial and temporal disorientation. Two months after surgery he was referred to the rehabilitation center for neuropsychological examination. Neuroradiological examination The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, acquired on a 0. 5 Tesla scanner (Gyroscan, T5-NT, Philips) 50 days after the surgery shows a well defined, hyperintense area on T2-weighted images, located within the brain parenchyma surrounding the surgical cavity, which presents regular walls and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content. The lesion is locat- ed in the middle frontal gyrus and extended mostly within the white matter of the centrum semiovale and the corona radiata in the right frontal lobe. The lesion was partially communicating with an enlarged right lateral ventricle (Figure 1) . Neuropsychological examination During examination Mr A. A. was in good clinical conditions, alert and cooperative, but he was tempo- rally disoriented. He was not aware of his memory problems and he did not remember neither the surgery nor personal events since one week before the surgery. His attentional performances on selective and shifting attention testing were within the normal range, while performance in the Interference condition of the Stroop test was mildly impaired. Both verbal and visu- al-spatial spans were defective, and he showed impaired performance in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, revealing deficits in working memory and divided attention. A. A. s long-term memory was seriously compromised. His everyday memory was assessed by the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, and his performance was clearly pathological. Both verbal and visual-spatial learning resulted also in pathological performances in the immediate recall of the list of Rey s 15-words, words-paired, short story, Corsi s spatial sequence and Rey s complex figure tests. Also delayed recall was seriously compromised both in verbal and non-verbal memory tests, and the patient showed impairments also in recognition tas There was no evidence of confabulations, and few intrusive errors and false recognitions. The patient seemed to be defective in the encoding phase, because during learning trials he could not make any seman- tic or phonetic associations between Rey's 15-words, and he also failed to learn any difficult pairs of words in the Associated Learning Test. The retrograde mem- ory of A. A. was spared correctly recalling the 56% of famous events in the 1990-1997 period in the Retrograde Memory Questionnaire, and his autobic graphical memories in an informal interview. A.

Instead, the patient showed impaired performances in the Wisconsin Sorting Card Test, indicating difficulties in conceptual reasoning and cognitive flexibility (Table D.

A. A. was still impaired in verbal and spatial working memory, learning and delayed recall. Also recognition showed still poor perfor- mances. He was well oriented in time and space, aware of his memory disorders, and he could remem- ber correctly both his disease and surgery. A. A. could recall some recent personal and social events with moderate difficulty, and he could drive through famil- iar routes, but he was still unable to go back to work. Discussion In summary, after surgery our patient showed 1) anterograde amnesia; 2) deficit of working memory; 3) mild deficit in the executive functions (specifically conceptual reasoning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibi- tion of interference) . Poor performances during learning tasks, impaired recognition, and defective cogni- tive strategies, suggest that the encoding process of the patient were compromised, probably because of his working memory deficit. It is well known that working mem- ory has a crucial role during the encoding process, because it provides active mainte- nance, rehearsal and elaboration of infor- mation during learning. On the other hand, the absence of confabulations and the few intrusions during recall indicate the sparing of the strategic control of memory retrieval. !! The authors hypothesize that the lesion, which was very near to the head of the right caudate nucleus, might have disconnected the frontal-striatum pathways, disrupting the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit. Broadman areas 9 and 10 are the source and termination of this circuit and they project to the dorsolateral caudate nucleus; the course enters the dorsal globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticu- lata. Then it passes through the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and returns back to the prefrontal cortex. !2 13 To support this hypothesis is the notion that the dorsolater- al prefrontal circuit has a crucial role in the cognitive process of working memory, long- term memory and executive functions, and a 96 AMNESIA AFTER RIGHT FRONTAL SUBCORTICAL LESION discrete lesion of this region might cause memory disturbances, *! with a specific role of the caudate nucleus. 1416 A role of the frontal-striatum network in working memo- ry processes as well as other memory func- tions has been proposed by some previous studies with normal subjects. 1 : '8 Strong evi- dences of the activation of the prefrontal cor- tex during working memory and encoding tasks come from several functional neu- roimaging studies. ! 2! Memory deficit in recall and recognition shown by our patient may also be explained by the disruption of the projections of the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, the former to the Papez s Circuit, the latter to the prefrontal cortex, which provides familiarity information and ensure item recognition. > This case demonstrates that an isolated lesion of the frontal white matter, disrupting the frontal subcortical circuits, may cause cognitive impairments with frontal features, and in cases in which the lesion imply the dis- ruption of memory-related circuits, can lead to memory loss without involvement of tra- ditional mnesic structures. It also may help to explain memory disorders in white matter diseases such as multiple sclerosis and lacu- nar state. ??. 23 Conclusions In conclusion, on the basis of the above reported literature, the authors suggest that the disconnection of the frontal-striatal-thal- amic pathways has caused A. A. s amnesia, determining impairment of the encoding process as a consequence of working mem- ory deficit.

L obiettivo di questa descrizione di un caso clinico stato quello di dare un contributo alla comprensione del ruolo del circuito fronto-striato-talamico nella memoria uma- na. Gli autori descrivono il profilo neuropsicologico longitudinale di un soggetto di sesso maschile di 40 anni di eta che ha sviluppato amnesia dopo asporta- zione di una cisti colloide asintomatica del setto pel- lucido e del terzo ventricolo, che aveva danneggiato la sostanza bianca frontale destra, risparmiando il fornice e altre regioni limbiche. Il paziente ha evi- denziato deficit della memoria di lavoro, amnesia anterograda per gli stimoli verbali e non verbali un lieve deficit esecutivo frontale. La valutazione a 13 mesi di distanza dall esordio dell amnesia ha eviden- ziato solo un lieve miglioramento di queste funzioni mnemoniche. Gli autori ipotizzano che l amnesiasia stata provocata dal peggioramento della memoria di lavoro e del processo di codificazione, come conse- guenza di una lesione del circuito dorsolaterale pre- frontale, che ha interrotto le proiezioni al neostriato e al talamo. Queste osservazioni suggeriscono che la via fronto-striato-talamica possa giocare un ruolo cruciale sulla memoria di lavoro e sui processi di codificazione ed anche che un meccanismo dei peg- gioramenti mnemonici nelle patologie della sostanza biancea sia rappresentato dalla disconnessione di queste connessioni fronto-sottocorticali.

(Department of 'Rehabilitation and *Neurological Surgery, Chiba Rosai Hospital, Ichiharashi, Japan) ABSTRACT We report a patient who showed a dissociation between impaired semantic memory and preserved autobiographic memory. M. N. , a 56-year-old right-handed woman, developed a supra sellar meningioma and underwent multiple operations. Following Lineac radiation, necrosis occurred in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes and in the right basal frontal lobe. The patient s intellectual deterioration and anterograde amnesia were mild. Language was preserved, but for a subtle anomia. Autobiographic memory remained intact, while semantic memory for public events, historical figures, cultural items, knowledge of low frequency words and technical terms related to her profession was severely impaired. We hypothesize that bilateral lesions of the anterior half of the middle region of the temporal lobe plays a crucial role in causing deficits in semantic memory. INTRODUCTION Tulving (1972, 1983) proposed a distinction between episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory is defined as memory for personal experiences which are dated and located in subjective time and space (Tulving, Schacter, McLachlan et al. , 1988) . In the realm of episodic memory, autobiographic memory enjoys a special status, because ego-related events are easily framed into a network of familiar, mutually interacting traces (De Renzi, Liotti and Nichelli, 1987) . Semantic memory consists of general knowledge about the world acquired through the media, education, and other sources of information. According to Tulving (1983) , it includes memory for faces, melodies, topography, knowledge of language, and so on. Though the semantic/episodic dichotomy has been questioned by several authors (Zola-Morgan, Cohen and Squire, 1983; Gabrieli, Cohen and Corkin, 1988) , and most patients who showed semantic memory deficits also suffered from episodic memory disturbances (see Kapur, 1993, for review) , De Renzi et al. (1987) reported for the first time a patient who showed a severe impairment of semantic memory for words, objects, famous persons, and public events in the absence of episodic or autobiographic memory disturbances. A similar pattern of deficits was reported by * A portion of the material of this work was presented at the meeting of Japanese Society of Aphasiology: 1993, at Kagoshima. Cortex, (1997) 33, 623-638 624 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others Grossi, Trojano, Grasso et al. (1988) . Their patient could not even give a vague definition of pedagogy, the main subject of her school curriculum, but she did recall that she had obtained remarkable grades on it. Because so few patients with this dissociation have been reported, the neurological substrate underlying semantic memory remains to be clarified. In this paper we present a patient with impaired semantic memory and preserved autobiographic memory. The lesions yielding this particular pattern of memory disturbance are discussed. METHOD AND RESULTS Clinical Investigations Case M. N. was a 56-year-old right-handed homemaker. She was a high-school graduate whose educational performance had always been noteworthy. She had been employed as a bank clerk for seven years. Her hobbies were travelling, singing in a choir and listening to classical music. For the past seven years she had volunteered as a singing instructor for members of a senior s club in her neighborhood. Medical History In 1978, M. N. developed a meningioma in the supra sellar region, and underwent a surgical removal through a right sub-frontal approach. She had recurrences of the tumor in the same region in 1982 and 1984, both of which were removed through a right sub-temporal route. Since the first operation, blurred vision of the right eye and diabetes insipidus were reported. In 1987, to prevent a further relapse, she received X-Ray radiation using a Lineac apparatus with parallel opposing portals (total 50 Gy in 25 fractions) . Toward the end of 1990, she began to lose interest in her hobbies. She showed personality changes, becoming increasingly nervous, selfish, and aggressive to such an extent that her relationship with friends was strained. Early in 1991, she began to feel bored with house work, and drank one or two cans of beer/day during the daytime. She noted that she could no longer memorize the words for choral presentations. By December 1992, she had developed anomia, paraphasia, poor noun comprehension, difficulty following complex recipes, Kanji alexia with agraphia (Iwata, 1984) , anterograde amnesia, and amnesia for familiar people (names, faces etc. ) , such as television personalities, her own friends and neighbors. Memory disturbance for driving routes also occurred. She hesitated to go to a hospital 40 km distant, while she drove in her neighborhood without any problem. The patient was re-admitted to our hospital on March 9, 1993. Staff members observed that her behavior was lacking in modesty and discretion. She would remain near the nurse s station and constantly complain to the staff. She Semantic and autobiographic memory 625 occasionally removed her underwear in the presence of others, but did not show sexual disinhibition and indiscriminate eating. Although she was aware of her neuropsychological defects, she lacked insight into their serious nature. Instead, she complained of sleeplessness and diarrhea. The diarrhea had been diagnosed by a physician as symptomatic of an irritable colon . Once diagnosed as suffering radiation necrosis, she was given large doses of Dexamethasone for two weeks. Brain Imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted. The MRI T2 weighed image showed that the right hemisphere (RH) lesions occupied the antero-inferior temporal lobe and the basal frontal lobe. The inferior horn of the lateral ventricle was dilated. They were consistent with damage due to multiple surgeries (Figure 1 A) . Fig. | - A= MRI T2 weighted axial images (April 5, 1993) ; B= MRI TI weighted coronal images with Gadolinium enhancement (March 17) ; C = MRI TI weighted axial images with Gadolinium enhancement (March 17) . 626 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others In addition, a wide area of abnormal signal intensity was detected in the left hemisphere (LH) . It encompassed the area from the LH temporal pole to the postero-inferior region of the temporal lobe. The LH _ hippocampus, parahippocampus, external capsule, corona radiata and medial occipital lobe were also slightly involved. The operculum, uncus and amygdala were damaged bilaterally (Figure 1, A and B) . The T1 weighted image with Gadolinium enhancement showed a lesion at the anterior half of the middle cortical and subcortical region of the LH temporal lobe (Figure 1, B and C) . The LH temporal pole, and the postero-inferior temporal region seemed to be relatively spared. We mapped the extension of the lesion on templates (Damasio and Damasio, 1989, partially revised) . Figure 2 revealed that the LH main enhanced lesion laid in the anterior half of area 21, with some involvement of area 20 and 22. Fig. 2 1 = The area of abnormal signal intensity by the T2 weighted images; 2 = The Gadolinium enhanced lesion; 3 = The area damaged due to surgeries. Neuropsychological Testing After the Dexamethasone therapy, the patient s condition improved steadily except for diarrhea and personality changes. The following neuropsychological testing were carried out for two weeks from March 23. Standard Language Test of Aphasia: This is a standardized aphasia test, commonly used in Japan. The patient flawlessly completed all of its subtests, with the exception of 3 anomic errors out of 20 items (17 points) in confrontation naming (Normal: 19. 6 points, SD=0. 8) . Articulation and prosody of spontaneaous speech were normal with no grammatical or lexical disturbances. Arithmetical operations and spontaneous writing produced no errors. Although subtle anomia remained, aphasia and Kanji alexia with agraphia had disappeared. Paired-associate Learning Test (Nokenshiki) : Immediate recall over three trials of 10 word pairs, whose members were semantically related, yielded 7 9 9 correct responses (Normals: 8. 5 9. 8 10) , while they were 2 3 - 3 respectively, when 10 semantically unrelated pairs were given (Normals: 4. 5 7. 6 8. 5) . Semantic and autobiographic memory 627 TABLE I WAIS-R Scores Verbal Subtest Score Performance Subtest Score Information 5 Picture Completion Digit Span 13 Picture Arrangement 12 Vocabulary 6 Block Design 11 Arithmetic 9 Object Assembly 8 Comprehension 5 Digit Symbol 13 Similarity 13 Verbal IQ = 91 Performance IQ = 101 Benton Visual Retention Test (Form A, Administration 1) : The results of this test were 8/10 correct responses. Although a mild anterograde amnesia was detected by the above tests, memory deficits were rarely observed in daily life. For example, the patient could recall in detail the events that had occurred in the previous days and write them in her diary, covering an entire page. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) : The patient s performance on WAIS-R was in the normal range (PIQ = 101 and VIQ=91) , though probably poorer than predictable from her education. Table I shows that she scored lower on the information, vocabulary and comprehension subtests of the Verbal Scale than on the other subtests. For instance, the name of the Sahara Desert evoked no familiarity from her and she recalled none of the names of Japanese prime ministers since World War II. She had no sense of familiarity for famous works of literature. In the vocabulary subtest, the first nine words are high frequency words. She could recall the meaning of 8 out of 9 high frequency words, but none of the other 26 low frequency words. These observations prompted us to investigate her memory deficits more in depth with a series of ad hoc testing for a month from March 29, 1993. The patient was alert and cooperative during their administration, showing no evidence of confabulation. We relied on her husband and two daughters to check the accuracy of her responses. Seven females, matched for age (mean = 57. 7 years, SD = 5. 5) and education (mean = 11. 1 years, SD = 1. 2) served as controls. Memory Testing Autobiographic Memory Free Recall of Autobiographic Events (see Appendix 1) : M. N. was asked to write her educational, occupational and medical history. She worked on each of these subjects for over 30 minutes until she was stopped by the examiner. In the educational history, she was able to provide the names of schools, friends, and all of her home-room teachers from primary school to junior-high school. She also recalled various autobiographic events such as boyfriends, school excursions, drama performances, finding a job, participation in the broadcasting club, and taking a leave of absence from school due to disease. When asked to describe a certain event in greater detail, she did it easily. 628 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others Photograph Description: We selected 10 photographs in which she and her acquaintances appeared, taken during the period from the 1950s to the 1970s (she was born in 1937) . We asked her to recollect the time, place, persons, and events pertaining to each photograph. She provided correct answers to all questions, except those concerning the place. She failed to recall the sites of 6 out of 10 photographs. However, when provided with the correct name of the places, she immediately identified four sites and added further details about the events represented by the photographs. Portraits Naming: Portraits of her 13 friends, 9 relatives and family members (e. g. nieces, brother and sister-in-law, son of the brother-in-law) were shown. All of them were recognized. Naming was 8/13 correct for friends, 9/9 for relatives and family members. Map Drawing: She could draw an accurate map of her neighborhood without hesitation. Comments: Although mild difficulties in recalling the places where the photographs had been taken were observed, the patient s autobiographic memory appeared to be preserved. Her family concurred with this evaluation. However, because of anterograde amnesia observed for a few years prior to the Dexamethasone treatment in 1993, her autobiographic memory for this period was very poor. Public Events Public Events (see Appendix 2) : Twenty major public events which had occurred since 1944 were selected. The names of these events were presented verbally to the patient, asking whether they raised a feeling of familiarity and she could recall any details related to them. Familiarity was assessed by the question Do you feel like having heard the name of the event? . Controls scored 99% for familiarity and 87% for correct recollection of details. On the contrary, she was familiar with only 4/20 events (1945: Atomic bomb, 1949: Dr. Yukawa, the first Japanese Nobel Prize awarded, 1957: The marriage of Prince Akihito, 1966: Vietnam War) . Concerning the details of these four events, she succeeded to recall that Prince Akihito married Michiko after they had played tennis together, but failed to give any correct detail on the other three events: 1945: Atomic bomb, Where was it dropped? It was dropped in Nishinomiya . She apparently mistook the Atomic bomb for an ordinary bomb which was dropped on her town. With further hints, she vaguely recollected Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 1949: Dr. Yukawa, Though I feel like having heard of this name, I don t know who he was , Was he awarded a Nobel Prize? I don t know . 1966: Vietnam War, I feel somewhat familiar with that war , to the question How did the Japanese Government and people react to that war? , I cannot remember . (Although the Japanese government supported the War, the anti-War movement prevailed among people) . The remaining 16 names of public events evoked no familiarity nor any details from the patient. For instance, although she had been living in Yokohama (located close to Tokyo) , she was surprised to hear 1964: Tokyo Olympic Games Semantic and autobiographic memory 629 and asked did such a big event really occur? . Concerning 1988: The Emperor Hirohito s death, she knew that the Emperor had existed, but did not know whether he was still alive. When, the examiner showed the patient a photograph book of the public events that had occurred in the Showa era (1925-1988) , she looked at them as if she was seeing them for the first time, and was unable to provide any information about them. Personally-involved Public Events: We inquired as to whether the patient had any recollection of five public events in which she was personally involved. 1945: The last day of World War II, I listened to the broadcasting news at my house. It was probably August 15, 1945. My parents and brother were very glad . 1967: Mini-skirt fashion, I know that it became popular before I married. Of course I too wore it . 1970: Osaka International Exposition, I went to Suita to see it with my. . . probably my mother . 1952: The radio drama Kiminonawa , I used to listen to that drama. The name of the actress was the same as mine. But, I have forgotten the content . 1956: The movie Nijushi no Hitomi , I went to the theater to see that movie. There were a lot of women in the film, and it may be not related to the war. I cannot remember its content further . (In fact, it was a story about a dozen children and a woman teacher and it was related to the war) . Controls showed 100% familiarity and 94% correct recollection of details of these five events. Comments: Memory for public events was severely impaired. She retained, however, a feeling of familiarity for public events in which she was personally involved, and remembered a few personal circumstances related to them, though memory for the content of the event was impaired. Anterograde memory for public events since 1992 was not assessed. Persons Historical Figures: The portraits of five well-known historical figures were selected from a text book for junior-high school students and were presented to the patient asking whether they were familiar. She gave a positive answer to only one of them (1/5) and, when given their names, she had a feeling of familiarity for 2/5 only. In no case was she able to match the names with their corresponding photographs. Controls scored 100% correct on familiarity and matching. Famous Singers: Five photographs of famous singers were presented to the patient for the same purpose as those of the historical figures. Familiarity was 4/5 (controls: 100%) . Naming was 1/5 correct (controls: 86%) . When provided with the correct names of the remainder, her familiarity was 2/4 (controls: 100%) . Famous Entertainers: Twenty photographs of famous entertainers were divided into four sets, each consisting of five photographs. The examiner gave the name and the patient was required to point to the corresponding photograph. Her feeling of familiarity was 14/20 (controls: 100%) , while verbal-visual matching were 11/20 correct (controls: 100%) . 630 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others Geography Map Drawing: All of controls could draw the outline map of Japan. The patient refused to draw it, saying I cannot remember it al all . She was, however, able to copy it easily. City Locations: The patient was required to judge her familiarity for the names of 20 major cities and to locate them on a blank map of Japan (25. 5 x 36 cm sheet) . Location was defined correct if she pointed to an area within 1. 5 cm from the real position of the city. Familiarity was 95% (controls: 100%) . Correct location was 60% (controls: 75%) . Famous Monuments: Colored post-cards of 10 famous monuments, such as the Parliament House, the Imperial Palace, and historical temples in Japan, were shown. Her familiarity and recognition was 8/10 and 6/10, respectively (controls: 100% for both) . Naming was 4/10 correct (controls: 87%) . Music MN. listened to 10 famous melodies which, according to her family, she knew premorbidly: Two children s songs, three popular songs and five melodies of classical music. Her familiarity with these melodies was 9/10 (controls: 100%) , but, when requested to recall the words of the six pieces that had a vocal component, she failed completely (controls: 80%) . For example, she had participated in the chorus of Beethoven s Ninth Symphony Choral three times in the last seven years. She did not, however, recollect a single word. She also failed to recall the titles of the remaining four melodies of classical music, such as Vivaldi s Four Seasons. When the titles and the names of the composers were given, she showed familiarity with them, but was not able to match the three components (title, composer, and melody) . Technical Terms Since the patient had worked as a bank clerk, her knowledge of four technical terms commonly used in the bank business was investigated. She failed to provide their definition: Tanpo (security to borrow money) : Is it a unit of money? . Kawase (money order) : I wasn t in charge of money orders. I don t know the meaning of it . Tegatawaribiki (discounting a bill) : Though my senior members were dealing with it, I don t know the meaning . Tozayokin (current account) : Though I was in charge of current accounts for a year, I am not sure, but the current account may be reduced in a time of depression . Other Memories The following photographs were presented to M. N. to evaluate her degree of familiarity with cultural items which are taught in junior-high school (controls: 100%) . The Ainu race (minority in Japan) wearing their traditional costume: T did not learn it . Statue of Haniwa (Ancient Japanese religious symbol) : I am looking at this for the first time . A statue of Tutankhamen in Egypt: I have never seen it . Semantic and autobiographic memory 631 Other types of memories we evaluated were proverbs and procedural memories. M. N. had no sense of familiarity for the popular proverbs Sarumo kikara ochiru (similar to Even Homer sometimes nods ) and Toranu Tanukino Kawasanyo ( Don t account your chickens before they are hatched ) . Controls showed 100% knowledge on these proverbs. On the other hand, she had no trouble in recognizing objects, and using appliances including a washing machine or a vacuum cleaner. After M. N. returned home, she would drive back to the hospital 30 km distant by herself. Thus procedural memory was intact. Summary of Memory Testing The results are summarized in Table II. Due to the patient s short hospitalization, the number of items in each category was regrettably low. However, she clearly demonstrated severe deficits in semantic memory across categories. Additionally, she showed lexical difficulty in low frequency words of WAIS-R and in technical terms that she had been acquainted with in her professional life, despite her perfect comprehension of high frequency words such as those used in the aphasia test. In contrast, retrograde autobiographic and procedural memory were preserved. Mental deterioration and anterograde amnesia after the Dexamethasone treatment were mild. Aphasia, which was reported in the acute stage, was no longer observed. The above pattern of impairment was very similar to that shown by the patients reported by De Renzi et al. (1987) and Grossi et al. (1988) , which was defined as global semantic amnesia with sparing of autobiographic memory by De Renzi et al. (1987) , and selective semantic amnesia by Grossi et al. (1988) . However, several categories of semantic memory were intact in the present patient. For instance, melodies, arithmetical operations, and high frequency words were preserved. The range of the categories impaired in semantic amnesia varies from patient to patient. There have been reports of patients who displayed category-specific semantic amnesia, such as amnesia for living beings (De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1994; Gainotti and Silveri, 1996) , foods and concrete words (Warrington and Shallice, 1984) and proper names (Semenza and Zettin, 1988) . Accordingly, we are inclined to use the term Multiple category semantic amnesia (MC semantic amnesia) with sparing of autobiographic memory . TABLE II Summary of Memory Testing Severely impaired categories Public events, historical figures, map drawing of Japan, technical terms, words of songs, cultural items, proverbs, low frequency words. Moderately impaired categories Personally-involved public events, famous singers and entertainers, city locations, famous monuments, titles of music and names of composers. Almost preserved categories Autobiographic memory, friends, relatives and family members, melodies, grammatical and arithmetical operations, high frequency words, map drawing of her neighborhood, objects, procedural memory. 632 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others Several authors have also reported patients with MC semantic amnesia, though in a less pure form (Kapur, Young, Bateman et al. , 1989; Ellis, Young and Critchley, 1989; Barr, Goldberg, Wasserstein et al. , 1990; Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury et al. , 1992; Kapur, Ellison, Parkin et al. , 1994) . DISCUSSION The dissociation between autobiographic and semantic memory, which was ambiguous in other studies (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Tulving, 1988; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) , was clear-cut in patient M. N. For instance, she remembered the details of her job as a staff member for the current account department of a bank, but had forgotten the meaning of current account and, though remembering to have seen a movie at theater, was unable to recollect its content. Similar symptoms have been observed in other reports of MC semantic amnesia (De Renzi et al. , 1987; Grossi et al. , 1988) . The reversed pattern, selective impairment of autobiographic memory and preservation of semantic memory, has also been reported (Damasio, Eslinger, Damasio et al. , 1985; Tulving et al. , 1988; Dalla Barba, Cipolotti and Denes, 1990) . A patient of Tulving et al. (1988) could not recollect any event related to the time he worked at a company, yet remembered the meaning of the technical terms used in his job. Personally experienced events, such as working at a company or watching a movie, are linked to autobiographic memory (De Renzi et al. , 1987) , whereas general knowledge such as technical terms or the content of a movie are classifiable as semantic memory. The double dissociation described above supports the semantic-episodic memory dichotomy (Tulving, 1972 and 1983) . Experimentally designed studies also have favored this distinction (Wood, Taylor, Penny et al. , 1980; Verfaellie and Cermak, 1994) . It has been suggested that different neurological substrates are involved in the two types of memory (Wood et al. , 1980; Damasio et al. , 1985) . As to semantic memory, neuropsychological studies have indicated that the right hemisphere plays a predominant role for the following semantic memories (RH-dominant semantic memory) : Topography (H caen, Tzortzis and Rondot, 1980) , musical knowledge (Confavreux, Croisile, Garassus et al. , 1992) , memory of faces and various attributes of people (Ellis et al. , 1989) . M. N. presented moderate impairment for famous entertainers and famous monuments. Familiarity with melodies was preserved. The RH temporal lesion in M. N. laid more anteriorly than that in the LH and the integrity of the RH posterior temporal lobe areas may have prevented a profound impairment of the RH-dominant semantic memory. On the other hand, our patient manifested serious memory deficits for proverbs, public events, words of songs, low frequency words, etc. Due to their verbally-related nature (Tulving, 1983; Barr et al. , 1990; Graff-Radford, Damasio, Hyman et al. , 1990) , these memories are likely to be mediated by the LH (LH- dominant semantic memory) . The LH damage in M. N. was more extensive compared to that of the RH. De Renzi et al. (1987) and Barr et al. (1990) hypothesized that the crucial lesion underlying the LH-dominant semantic Semantic and autobiographic memory 633 memory deficits involved the LH medial temporal region. However, the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus are unrelated to semantic memory (Zola- Morgan, Squire and Amaral, 1986; Rausch and Babb, 1993; Parkin, Rees, Hunkin et al. , 1994) . Kapur et al. (1994) suggested that the anterior-inferior- neocortical temporal lobe plays an important role. However, the main clinical symptom following anterior temporal region (the temporal pole) damage is word anomia (Stafiniak, Saykin, Sperling et al. , 1990; Tyrrell, Warrington, Frackowiak et al. , 1990) . In our patient, the anterior half of the middle region (centered on area 21) showed enhancement, likely attributable to the recently developed lesion. This region is localized in the temporal association area (Flechsig, 1896) , and in area TE (Cowey and Gross, 1970; Iwai, 1988) . Monkey studies (Iwai, 1988) suggest that area TE is more implicated with cognition and memory storage than area TEO, located in the posterior half of the temporal region. Tanabe, Ikeda, Nakagawa et al. (1992) assumed that the impairment of the middle region of the LH temporal lobe is related to word meaning loss in patients with lobar atrophy. We hypothesize that damage to the anterior half of the middle region (centered on area 21) plays a crucial role not only in word meaning loss but also in the deficit of other LH-dominant semantic memory. The postero-inferior region of the LH temporal lobe was impaired in patient L. P. (De Renzi et al. , 1987) , who showed severe amnesia for concrete nouns, objects of daily life, etc. , while it was relatively spared in M. N. and TJ. (Kapur et al. , 1994) , who did not show this type of amnesia. However, the extent of the damage caused in the LH temporal lobe by necrosis or edema remains unknown and prevents any firm conclusion on the functional specialization of this lobe. Some researchers suggest that semantic memory is also represented in the prefrontal cortex (Demb, Desmond, Wagner et al. , 1995) and in the parietal lobe (Grossi et al. , 1988; Gabrieli, Keane, Stanger et al. , 1994) . Further data must be collected to assess the functional contribution of the above regions as substrates of semantic memory. It is important to note that the so far reported case of the MC semantic amnesia (L. P. , TJ. , M. N. ) did have bilateral lesions. M. N. had shown no amnesic symptoms until the LH radiation necrosis developed. Although some cerebral laterality exists, deficits of semantic memory, including the RH-dominant semantic memory, may require bilateral damage (Schwartz, Marin and Saffran, 1979; Kapur et al. , 1994) . For instance, semantic memory for idioms may require the LH linguistic processing as well as the RH metaphorical/inferential processing (Van Lancker and Kempler, 1987; Wapner, Hamby and Gardner, 1981) . Bilateral impairment, which means hemispheric inability to reciprocal compensation (H caen et al. , 1980) , may result in a severe deficits of semantic memory. As to episodic memory, an increasing number of studies argue that the frontal lobe or the basal forebrain are implicated with the following functional aspects of episodic memory: Appreciation of time-sequences, contextualization of the experience (Damasio et al. , 1985) , retrieval of the context for each experience (Shallice, Fletcher, Frith et al. , 1994; Della Sala, Laiacona, Spinnler et al. , 1993) , and recollection of how an episodic memory was acquired (Schacter, Harbluk and McLachlan, 1984; Shimamura and Squire, 1987) . 634 Kiyoshi Yasuda and Others Also in memory acquisition, strategic mediation by the frontal lobe is required (Rudge and Warrington, 1991; Verfaellie and Cermak, 1994) . This is exemplified by a patient (Fujita, Ishikawa, Kumakura et al. , 1991) who mistook a TV scene for an event that had actually occurred, and in which he was personally involved. Although the content of TV or movie scenes would be classified as semantic memory, the patient misclassified them as his own episodic memory. Our patient M. N. had a lesion in the RH basal frontal lobe, but she seemed to show no symptoms suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction except for personality change (Neary, Snowden, Goulding et al. , 1988) and for some disinhibition in the acute stage. The spared LH frontal lobe may have succeeded to compensate for the damaged RH frontal lobe. The same can be said of other patients with MC semantic amnesia (L. P. , P. N. , T. J. ) . Recently, the precuneus (Shallice et al. , 1994) , the splenial (Rudge and Warrington, 1991) , the retrosplenial (Valenstein, Bowers, Verfaellie et al. , 1987) , the posterior cingulate (Lucchelli, Muggia and Spinnler, 1995) and the diencephalic regions (Stuss, Guberman and Nelson, 1988; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) were also suggested as participating in a network with a distinctive role in episodic memory (Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Shallice et al. , 1994) . Their sparing in MC semantic amnesic patients may account for the preservation of episodic or autobiographic memory. Acknowledgements.

L. , friend was an eye doctor of ROSAI hospital, thus I went to see him (I forget his name) . On the very first day of the exam, he told me that my eye problem was not the matter of ophthalmology, and I was referred to the department of neurosurgery. Dr. Watanabe, a neurosurgeon, looking at the X ray films, told me I m afraid you seem to be suffering from a brain tumor. It appears to be involving the optic nerve . I was admitted to the neurosurgery unit and underwent several tests. Consequently a surgery was unavoidable. Dr. Watanabe told me at that time that I could have a surgery at whichever institute | wanted; otherwise he would willingly do it himself. As my daughter lived in Kansai, and both my mother and younger brother were living in Hyogo-ken, I asked Dr. Watanabe to refer me to KYOTO university hospital, considering that it might be easier for my relatives to attend me during hospitalization. Doctors of the neurosurgery unit of ROSAI hospital looked surprised at my remark and said There is one of the most famous neurosurgeons in Japan at the KYOTO university hospital. How did you get to know that? Well, I had indeed no idea at all about that neurosurgeon, but the doctors of the neurosurgery unit looked very much satisfied, and told me that they would write a referral letter and I should visit KYOTO university hospital. I told without delay my old boy friend, who is a graduate of the medical school of KYOTO university and the director of the medicine institute which he had built, that I was wondering whether the famous professor Handa of KYOTO university would be willing to operate on my brain tumor. His answer was no. He said One referral letter is not enough. Another referral letter from a professor of internal medicine who is my boss would do it. I will ask the professor to write that. You need to be admitted to the department of internal medicine first. You badly need a referral letter from the same school . Eventually, I was admitted to internal medicine and then was referred to the neurosurgery unit. On the first day on my move to the neurosurgery unit, I could meet professor Handa. The patients of the neurosurgery unit were from Hokkaido to Kyushu, even from the U. S. A. Everybody knew the neuroclinic was very famous. I was shocked when I was first informed that I was suffering from a brain tumor and I thought I might not live long. I was told that the whole head was to be shaved, and that the tumor might not be eradicated, but that the right side of the growing tumor would be removed. As to side effects, the right eye would become blind and the volume of urine would increase enormously. The right side blindness was unavoidable and I might, I was told, have to take the medicine, which the patients of the terminal stage of the diabetes mellitus (diabetes insipidus?*) take to reduce the volume of urine, possibly for the rest of my life. Prof. Handa and four team doctors in charge looked relieved, when they found out that the tumor was not of a malignant variety. | myself wondered how could they operate inside of the head, and I was relieved to find out that the visual loss was only on the right side, thus I could live on. After two months or so, I was discharged and I reported to ROSAI hospital that the operation had been successful. * Author s note. It took about 30 minutes for M.

In 1978 the right eye became occasionally blurred. When I looked at some objects, I noticed some horizontal fine lines drifting in the field. I thought at first it was due to eye fatigue, so I bought a phial of eye drops at a pharmacy and started using it. But I still felt strange objects in the eye which made the vision blurred. So I went to seen an eye doctor at CHUOH hospital of Kisarazu. I was informed that I was suffering from an eye disease, the name of which I forget, and that it could be cured, though it would take some time. I kept on seeing the doctor for about a year, but my eye condition was not improved.

K. (Received 26 October 1994; accepted 26 January 1995) Abstract We report the first human case of combined mammillary body and medial thalamic lesions due to focal pathology. A patient presented with a multi-lobular lesion that affected the mammillary bodies, the medial thalamus and the brain stem. On neuropsychological testing, he showed significant anterograde memory impairment, with marked impairment on delayed story recall, but normal or only mildly impaired performance on retrograde memory tasks. Our findings corroborate the results of recent non-human lesion studies and indicate that some of the well-established features of the amnesic syndrome, such as severe retrograde amnesia, may not be due to primary diencephalic pathology. Significant retrograde amnesia may result from cortical pathology or from an interaction between cortical and subcortical pathology. Key Words: thalamus; retrograde amnesia; diencephalon. Introduction Studies of the amnesic syndrome have indicated that diencephalic structures are a critical component of the limbic diencephalic memory system [1, 2, 6]. However, there remains substantial disagreement as to the precise anatomical profile that underlies memory deficits after damage to diencephalic structures, and whether or not lesions in specific structures are sufficient or necessary for particular components of the amnesic syndrome [3, 25, 29, 38-41, 47]. Some cases have suggested that thalamic pathology may occur without significant retrograde amnesia [36, 37], while other articles [e. g. 14] have pointed to severe retrograde amnesia after focal thalamic lesions. Recently, a non-human study by Langlais et al. [24] found that combined medial thalamic and mammil- lary body lesions, brought about by a 2-week period of pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) , resulted in anterograde but not retrograde memory deficits. In addition to the presence of medial *Also at Departments of Psychology and Neurosciences, University of Southampton, UK. tAddress for correspondence: Dr N. Kapur, Wessex Neurological Centre, Southampton General Hospital, South- ampton SO16 6YD, U. K. thalamic and mammillary body pathology, the authors noted that no pathological changes were evident in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, septum, central grey, substantia nigra, or raphe nuclei of any of the PTD animals (1992, p. 180) . There has not yet been any comparable human lesion evidence that specifically focuses on this issue. Combined mammillary body and medial thalamic lesions are very rarely encountered in neurological practice, and this has contributed to the lack of corroborative human evidence in this respect. We report a patient who presented with a multi- lobular brain tumour that displayed a striking profile of focal lesions, one that was remarkably similar to that associated with a number of animal lesion studies of diencephalic amnesia. The selectivity of his memory disorder enabled us to fractionate the anatomical contribution of diencephalic and other pathology towards components of the amnesic syndrome. Method Clinical history K. K. (d. o. b. 21 September 1936) is a right-handed man who had worked as both a furniture restorer and a lorry driver. He 2 N. Kapur et al. /Anterograde memory loss following lesions presented in August 1993 with a short history of diplopia, ataxia, polyuria, polydypsia and weight loss. He subsequently developed other hypothalamic signs, including diabetes insipidus. Past medical history was generally unremarkable in 1988, he had been investigated for blackouts that were initially thought to be epileptic, but standard and sleep- deprived EEG failed to show any abnormality, and these episodes subsequently resolved. To detailed questioning, he admitted to a few episodes of heavy alcohol consumption in the distant past, but in recent years his alcohol intake had been limited to social drinking. An MR liver scan showed no evidence of liver cirrhosis. On admission, he did not have any evidence of an acute confusional state, neither on clinical interview nor from observations of ward staff or his wife. Magnetic resonance imaging (Figs 1-4) was carried out on 19 August 1993 and showed a multi-lobular lesion. Detailed consideration of the lesion in relation to anatomical atlases [9] showed that it affected the hypothalamus, including the mammillary bodies, the thalamus and the brain stem. The involvement of the mammillary bodies was complete, invol- ving both medial and lateral areas. The pathology did not appear to extend to the medium septum/forebrain, but it did appear to extend caudally and dorsally to include the supramammillary region. The thalamic lesion affected medial areas, with ventral and posterior nuclei being affected more than dorsal and anterior nuclei. There was also slightly greater left- than right-sided medial thalamic involvement. The brain stem lesion affected the lower tectum region of the mid-brain. There was no evidence of damage to the hippocampus or other medial temporal lobe structures. The patient s condition progressed despite a course of radiotherapy, and he sadly died in December 1993. No post-mortem was carried out (it is likely that the tumour itself would have spread to involve other structures, and that this together with possible necrosis following radiotherapy might in fact have invalidated any anatomical post-mortem study) . Neuropsychological investigations These investigations were carried out between 18 and 28 August 1993. On the basis of nine subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised, K. K. had a Verbal IQ of 105, a Performance IQ of 80 and a Full-Scale IQ of 93. His lower Performance IQ was probably in part related to his visual disturbance. His overall Verbal IQ was consistent with his performance on an adult reading test [34], this yielding a predicted Verbal IQ of 109. He performed normally on tests of naming [31], verbal fluency (FAS) , complex copying (Rey Figure) and problem-solving ability [33]. Performance on anterograde memory tests (Table 1) showed a marked impairment in delayed recall, with almost a 30 points difference between General and Delayed Memory Quotients. Recognition memory for faces and for word stimuli [45] was mildly impaired. A range of retrograde memory tests were administered. In the case of autobiographical memory [21], he scored normally (Table 2) on personal semantic aspects of autobiographical memory, and normal or borderline in his recall of autobio- graphical incidents. An interview with his wife also failed to yield evidence of K. K. showing any autobiographical memory difficulties for pre-illness events. He was administered a Real Fictitious public events test similar to that which has been used elsewhere [14, 17]. Twenty-five events that had occurred in the 6 years prior to his illness were randomly interspersed with 25 fictitious but plausible events. He was asked to indicate those that had really occurred. His score (23/25) was similar to that (24/25) of three matched control subjects. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised, his Informa- tion subtest age-scaled score was in fact rather above average (13) this subtest contains a number of general knowledge items that are sensitive to the presence of a significant degree of retrograde amnesia. On the Dead-or-Alive test [19], where he had to indicate whether famous personalities were alive, and also how and when they died, he performed within the range of control subjects (Fig. 5) . He did show some impairment in indicating whether current personalities were still alive. Discussion Our patient s lesion profile included involvement of the mammillary bodies, medial thalamus and brain stem. However, the sole part of the amnesic syndrome that he displayed was significant anterograde memory loss. His performance on retrograde memory tests was intact or only mildly impaired, and there was absence of an acute confusional state at the time of admission. Our findings strongly suggest that features of the syndrome, such as dense retrograde amnesia alcoholic Korsakoff and acute confusional state, may be due to pathologies other than those lesions that have been identified on brain imaging or post-mortem. In parti- cular, it would seem possible that the major retrograde amnesia shown by some amnesic patients may be due to cortical pathology, or to an interaction between subcortical and cortical pathology. The presence of cortical and hippocampal damage in chronic alcoholic patients and in Wernicke Korsakoff patients has been demonstrated by structural imaging techniques [16]. It has also been found in a functional imaging study of a group of amnesic patients, two of whom had Korsakoff s syndrome [11]. It is, therefore, rather surprising that two recent post-mortem studies [25, 29] have found relatively small amounts of cortical damage. However, one of the two studies [29] did find that, when more sensitive measures of tissue damage such as nucleolar volume were used, damage to frontal and temporal lobe cortex, and also to hippocampus, could be delineated. In addition to such differences in sensitivity of measurement techniques, differences in patient population may also have contributed to differences between post-mortem studies of brain morphology in Wernicke Korsakoff patients. The brain stem lesion shown by our patient involved the lower tectum. The relative sparing of the tegmentum and adjacent nuclei probably explains the absence on physical examination of signs such as nystagmus or ophthalmoplegia that are found in Wernicke Korsakoff patients. While the subcortical anatomical lesion profile found in our patient was very similar to that seen in post- mortem studies of Wernicke-Korsakoff patients, there were also a few differences. In the case of the hypothalamic lesion, this was probably more extensive in our patient than that found post-mortem in N. Kapur et al. /Anterograde memory loss following lesions 3 Fig. 1.

Sagittal T; weighted images following Gadolinium show homogeneously enhancing multi-lobular lesions in the area of the hypothalamus (H) with likely involvement of the tuber cinereum; the thalamus (TH) ; and the lower half of the tectal plate in the mid-brain (M-B) .

Wernicke-Korsakoff patients, affecting anterior hypothalamic nuclei in addition to the mammillary bodies. The thalamic lesion in our case affected ventro- medial rather than dorso-medial nuclei, and in this respect differed slightly from the classical Wernicke Korsakoff finding with regard to thalamic pathology. However, it is of note that Mayes ef al. [29] and Mair et al. [25] pointed to a thin band of medial thalamic gliosis in their patients, with little in the way of lateral spread of pathology into dorsomedial nuclei as seemed to be the case in the Victor et al. [44] patients. Both Mair et al. [25] and Victor et al. [44] commented on the difficulty 4 N. Kapur et al. /Anterograde memory loss following lesions Fig. 3. An axial view shows the thalamic spread of the tumour, with postero-medial nuclei of the left thalamus being particularly involved. Fig. 4. A coronal view confirms this thalamic profile of the lesion. of making more precise anatomical distinctions, and also pointed to terminological problems in describing such discrete damage. It remains possible that if our patient s thalamic lesion had been more anterior and dorsal it would have resulted in significant retrograde amnesia, but there is no clearly convincing evidence from thalamic amnesia studies that this would necessa- rily have been the case [6, 7, 13, 26]. In addition, it is worth noting cases where thalamic lesions are present but without any major memory loss [22]. These authors suggested that it was the partial nature of the lesions and/or their dorsomedial locus that may have resulted in the absence of significant memory impairment in their patient. It is also worth noting that dorsomedial thalamic pathology may occur as an indirect sequel to prefrontal lesions [35]. A classical amnesic syndrome has not yet been documented in such cases with verified secondary dorsomedial pathology, nor in patients who N.

Detailed memory testing has seldom been reported in such studies, although the latter paper by Zamboni et al. [46] found in one of their two cases a small increase in IQ scores and a return to full-time employment after surgery. In a few patients with thalamic lesions, significant retrograde amnesia has been reported to be present in addition to anterograde memory deficits [e. g. 14, 27]. It remains unclear as to the mechanisms of such retro- grade memory loss. Several possible explanations may account for this pattern of memory disorder. Firstly, the well-established cortical hypometabolism that is associated with thalamic lesions [e. g. 42] may result in dysfunction in temporal and frontal cortical areas that are critical to retrograde memory functioning. The Hodges and McCarthy [14] patient did show neurop- sychological evidence of significant frontal lobe dys- function. Secondly, as pointed out by Hodges and McCarthy [14], a more specific retrieval/executive deficit may be present that arises from damage to thalamic frontal tracts and leads to a disconnection of anterior from posterior cerebral processing systems. Thirdly, it is possible that since thalamic blood supply usually comes from arteries that are branches of the posterior cerebral artery, the temporal lobe branches of the posterior cerebral artery are also compromised in some patients, leading to temporal lobe damage that results in a combination of retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Fourthly, it is possible that undetected or somewhat neglected pathology may have contributed to patients memory loss. For example, in the Hodges and McCarthy [14] case, dark shadows are present bilaterally in basal ganglia structures anterior to the bithalamic lesion, though it remains possible that in this case they simply represent benign aluminium deposits.

Kapur et al. /Anterograde memory loss following lesions It would appear that of the two episodic memory circuits proposed by Mishkin [32], it is the hippo- campal-mammillary body circuit, rather than the amygdala dorsomedial thalamus circuit, that was most likely to have been involved in our patient. Our study suggests, therefore, that a moderate but not severe degree of anterograde memory loss may be present if only one of these two major memory circuits is damaged. It is possible that a particularly severe anterograde memory loss, with both recall and recogni- tion memory being markedly affected, would have followed if both circuits had suffered pathology. It is also possible that there is a relationship between the presence of a particularly severe anterograde memory impairment and the presence of significant retrograde amnesia, and that the former is a precondition for the latter to occur. We cannot distinguish between the respective con- tributions of the mammillary body and the thalamic pathology towards our patient s memory impairment. His memory profile could be seen to be similar both to that found in patients with primary hypothalamic involvement [10], to the effects of fornix lesions [12], and to the sequelae of medial thalamic pathology [7, 13, 37], though his anterograde memory deficits are possibly less severe than those that have been reported after some cases of medial thalamic infarction [14]. It remains possible that, since the medial thalamic pathology was more posterior than anterior, most of the contribution towards our patient s poor anterograde memory came from mammillary body rather than thalamic involvement. It may in fact be more appro- priate to suggest that our patient did have a de facto anterior thalamic lesion Aggleton [1] has argued that given the close anatomical link between the mammil- lary bodies and the anterior thalamic nuclei, it may prove more accurate to regard these diencephalic regions as part of a single mnemonic system, especially as they both receive dense inputs from the hippo- campus [l, p. 40]. It is also worth noting that our thalamic lesion may well have compromised the nucleus reuniens. In view of the connections of this nucleus with the hippocampal region, the hippocampus may have been indirectly compromised in two ways by the mammillary body lesion, and the ventro-medial tha- lamic lesion. A brief clinical report of a patient, with a cerebral lymphoma having a similar distribution to that of our patient, reported that recent memory was impaired, but that remote memory was intact [28]. Few reports of patients with thalamic tumours are directly comparable to our patient. Two case reports of patients with thalamic tumours [5, 30] have commented upon the presence of retrograde amnesia it is possible that the contrast with our case, where retrograde amnesia was conspicuous by its relative absence, may have been due to the invasion of different nuclei by the tumour. In the case reported by McEntee et al. [30], there was also metastatic spread of the tumour to other areas, including the left temporal lobe, and this may in part have explained that patient s marked retrograde amnesia. It is also possible that discrepancies can be explained by differential displacement of posterior cerebral arteries that supply the temporal lobes. For example, Ignelzi and Squire [15] found that angio- graphy showed displacement of the posterior cerebral arteries as the result of an expanding third ventricle tumour, with a return to normal arterial configuration when this cystic tumour was drained in their patient, retrograde amnesia improved following such interven- tion. It is possible that the aetiology of our patient s lesion is an important factor that distinguishes his memory performance from other similar cases. Neo- plastic pathology may differ in its pathophysiological effects from the occlusive/haemorrhagic vascular pathology found in patients with thalamic cerebrovas- cular lesions, and from the haemorrhagic lesions and metabolic abnormalities associated with Wernicke Korsakoff patients.

[44] described a global confusional state that was present in many of their Wernicke-Korsakoff patients Characteristi- cally, the patients were inert, indifferent to everyone and everything in their environment, and inattentive, and they had great difficulty in concentrating on the simplest tasks. Spontaneous speech was minimal. Many questions directed to them went unanswered, and such questions as were answered betrayed an inability to identify those around them or grasp the meaning of their illness or their immediate situation. Many of their remarks were irrational or inconsistent from one moment to the next [44, p. 16]. The absence of such an acute confusional state in our patient suggests that acute metabolic or alcohol- related factors may explain the presence of such a state in their series. In the retrograde memory loss found in amnesic patients, one plausible hypothesis is that a major role is played by cortical damage, possibly to frontal and temporal lobe areas [18, 20], or some form of interaction between cortical damage and _ limbic diencephalic damage. Langlais [23] has suggested that the retro- grade amnesia of Korsakoff s disease may be caused by damage to structures outside of the diencephalon, perhaps in cortical association areas, frontal cortex, or temporal lobe [23, p. 447]. Van Hoesen [43] has pointed out that, in some forms of human memory disorder, pathological changes that affect the lateral temporal, posterior parahippocampal, temporopolar, and anterior insular cortices may contribute to retro- grade memory abnormalities. Van Hoesen also high- lighted the multi-modal nature of afferent connections to these structures from association cortices. Similarly, Damasio and Damasio [8] have noted the importance of cortical memory systems for item retrieval during knowledge-based memory tasks. N. Kapur et a/. /Anterograde memory loss following lesions 7 Summary We have shown that combined mammillary body and medial thalamic lesions cannot by themselves produce important features of the amnesic syndrome such as dense retrograde amnesia. Our findings corroborate results from animal lesion studies [24], and point to other cerebral mechanisms as being critical to retro- grade memory functioning.

Received 8 December 1995 and in revised form 12 March 1996 Accepted 12 March 1996 Right temporofrontal cortex as critical locus for the ecphory of old episodic memories P Calabrese, H J Markowitsch, H F Durwen, H Widlitzek, M Haupts, B Holinka, W Gehlen Abstract A 54 year old patient of average intelli- gence with a severe and enduring loss of old autobiographical memories after her- pes simplex type 1 infection is described. She was tested with a comprehensive neu- ropsychological battery two years after the infection. Special emphasis was laid on examining different aspects of retrograde memory. The neurological examination involved MRI and SPECT. Brain damage was found mainly in the right tempo- rofrontal region, but minor left sided dam- age to this region seems possible. The patient was in the normal or slightly sub- normal range for all tested anterograde memory functions, but manifested severe retrograde memory deficits with respect to episodic old memories and more moderate deficits in tests of general knowledge (semantic old memories) . It is concluded review, ? the hypothesis that the combined action of inferolateral prefrontal and anterolateral temporal cortices is necessary for the retrieval of long term memory, was advanced on the basis of a comparison of sev- eral case reports and data on memory retrieval in normal subjects obtained with PET. Furthermore, it was speculated that these regions in the right hemisphere would primarily be engaged in triggering episodic old memories, whereas the same regions of the left hemisphere would be involved in retrieving information from the knowledge system. '? We report the case of a patient who fits into this proposed scheme by being selectively retrogradely amnesic in the episodic memory domain and having a SPECT documented hypoperfusion in the right temporo frontal junction area. Case report The patient, a 54 year old right handed woman had been admitted three years ago to the hospi- tal as an emergency case with herpes simplex type 1 meningoencephalitis. NEUROLOGICAL AND NEURORADIOLOGICAL EVALUATION The history of her illness started with com- plaints of nausea and tiredness one week before admission. Two days before admission she developed high fever with temperatures up to 39-8 C, complained about increasing head- aches, and became more and more disoriented. Intermittently she was unable to recognise her family and showed signs of visual hallucinations for short periods. Finally she drifted into a state of severe drowsiness. Her previous medical history involved left sided mastectomy for breast cancer as well as a hysterectomy, both about 10 years earlier. The family history of the patient disclosed no events with neurological, psychiatric, or other rele- vance. On admission she was in a severe drowsy state, but could be awakened by painful exter- nal stimuli. She was then able to answer simple questions with yes or no, and to carry out simple movements to verbal command. A more com- plex form of communication, however, was not possible. Further neurological examination dis- closed soft meningeal signs as well as a discrete to moderate left sided hemiparesis including Right temporofrontal cortex as critical locus for the ecphory of old episodic memories Figure 1 General T1 weighted MRI after Gd Porbrmed shot Se years after infection.

Babinski s sign was positive and the muscular reflexes were raised on the left. Reactions to painful stimuli could be elicited from both sides to the same extent. An initial cranial CT showed a hypoattenua- tion in both hemispheres with a discrete right sided accentuation, predominantly in the fron- totemporal region. After injection of an intra- venous contrast a diffuse inhomogeneous enhancement was seen in the areas affected. A cranial CT control, one month later, was nor- mal.

The damage included anterior portions of the right amygdalohippocampal region and affected in particular the region of the pathway of the right ventral branch of the uncinate fascicle (fig 1 in Markowitsch'*) .

An ECD SPECT, performed in the initial phase of the disease, showed a pronounced hyperperfusion in the right frontotemporal area. After three months, a control SPECT still showed a moderate hyperperfusion in the same region, whereas a control, done three years later, showed an area of circumscribed hypoperfusion in the same location (fig 3) . Initial EEG recording showed a moderate but generalised slowing of the background activity as well as a theta/delta focus in the right temporoparietal region. Furthermore, intermittent epileptogenic activity charac- terised by single sharp waves, was recorded in the same area, without clinical evidence of epileptic seizures during her stay in hospital. After six months the EEG recording was com- pletely normal. Analysis of CSF showed a white cell count of 840/3 cells and a protein level of 58 mg%. The serological data showed positive findings of IgG and IgM antibodies to the herpes sim- plex type 1 virus. Values for CSF became nor- mal six months after onset of the disease. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION Testing was performed two years after the infection. The neuropsychological tests and a summary of the results are listed in the table. They included tests of intelligence, attention, concentration, language, cognitive flexibility, and various forms of memory tests. Most of these tests have been used and described in detail in previous publications. '?'>' The patient was alert and motivated. She took part in conversations, was socially well adjusted, and was able to interact in various ways. When instructed, she could remember to do something or to go to a certain place. In formal testing, she gained an IQ of 103 points, and her attention was in the normal range. In the Wechsler memory scale R she was in the lower average range (general memory index 93 points) . Other tests of verbal and non-verbal anterograde memory confirmed the impres- sion of her normal to somewhat sub-average anterograde memory abilities. Her cognitive flexibility was below average. RETROGRADE MEMORY The patient described herself as lacking episodes of her personal past from several decades before her brain infection. We used the following tests to determine her perfor- mance level in the domains of retrograde episodic and semantic memory: the autobio- graphical memory interview (AMI) \" and the Crovitz form test! were given to assess her Right temporofrontal cortex as critical locus for the ecphory of old episodic memories Neuropsychological tests used and main test results Normative data Assessed function and test Patient Control subjects Intelligence 103 100 (SD 15) Attention: d2 Concentration-endurance test 32%ile 25%ile-75%ile Trail making test, form A 50%ile 50%ile Language: Token test 95%ile Cognitive flexibility: FAS verbal fluency test 16 (cut off 17) Trail making test, form B 83 (25%ile) 50%ile Proactive interference 7, 6, 4, 4, 4* Learning and anterograde memory: Digit span forward 6 5-6 Digit span backward 4 45 Corsi block span forward 5 5 Corsi block span backward 4 45 Wechsler memory scale-R Attention/concentration index 87 100 Verbal memory index 99 100 Visual memory index 88 100 General memory index 93 100 Delayed recall 86 100 Rey auditory verbal learning test Trial 1 6 64 Trial 2 7 8-2 Trial 3 9 10-2 Trial 4 9 11-1 Trial 5 11 11-6 Distractor (list B) 4 46 List 6 7 9-9 Delayed recall 7 10-2 Rey complex figure Copy 35 35 30 minute delay 18 18-8 Retrograde memory: Autobiographic memory interview Personal semantic events (childhood, adulthood, recent) 14, 12-5, 18 21, 20, 21 Autobiographical incidents (Childhood, adulthood, recent) 1, 2, 7 8, 9, 9 Crovitz test (10 words per time period) * See fig. 4 Famous faces test} 27% 42% Semantic general knowledge test * 71 > 92 For the Rey audito verbal learning test and the Rey complex figure means are given after Spreen and Strauss; for the AMI the scores are given for a control subject of comparable age (taken from Weniger er al ) . * Although the number of remembered items is not atypical, the release from proactive interference (4, her last score) is below average. $See fig. 5 Figure 4 Performance of the patient in the Crovitz test. Out of 10 possible responses/period, the patient was able to give only three or two for her earliest decades, and five for the period after the infection. episodic retrograde memory, and for testing her general knowledge the semantic general knowledge test of Schmidtke'*' and a famous faces test'?' were used. The AMI consists of a semistructured interview covering all epochs of a subject s life; it is subdivided into two parts covering the more general, semantic, and the personal events domains. In the Crovitz form test 10 high frequency nouns are admin- istered and the patient is asked to describe personal experiences and unique episodes relating to each word. The instructions were: 34 Responses 1972-81 1962-71 o- 1952-61 1992-94 1982-91 1994-95 Time period Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 12, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com 307 10 Responses 0 1956-65 1966-75 1976-85 1986-93 Time period Figure 5 Famous faces test; 15 faces were presented/ period.

Relate personally experienced life events from any time period evoked by each of the following words. . . , and Now estimate the date of its occurrence. The semantic general knowledge test uses 100 items of the kind What is the name for the child of a cow? or What is the currency used in Switzerland? It furthermore includes questions on geography, famous people, and animals, animal products, and attributes. The famous faces test con- tained per decade 15 portraits of famous people (sportspersons, politicians, actors, etc) . By contrast with her abilities to learn and remember new information, she had persistent and severe deficits in her old memory abilities. These were most prominent for her autobio- graphical past (fig 4) , whereas her general knowledge, measured with a famous faces test (fig 5) and the world knowledge test (and also partly reflected by the semantic part of the autobiographical memory interview) was much less affected (table) . Discussion Our patient is another in a series of several patients with a clear dissociation between anterograde and retrograde memory abilites. ' !**? She also fits into a series of patients with combined damage of predomi- nantly temporopolar and inferolateral pre- frontal regions and focal retrograde amnesia. '* (Her brain damage included the right medial temporal lobe as well, but we assume from comparing her case with previous ones!?!!!> that the lateral temporal lobe regions are criti- cally implicated in retrograde amnesia. ) Furthermore, she corresponds to the proposed scheme of hemispheric specific retrograde memory disturbances : her brain damage is predominantly right hemispheric and her memory disturbances are largely in the episodic memory domain. She also fits into the scheme proposed by Markowitsch' for the occurrence of retrograde amnesia by having bilateral (although mainly right sided) brain damage. The aetiology of her brain damage is not unusual for patients with severe memory Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 12, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com Calabrese, Markowitsch, Durwen, Widlitzek, Haupts, Holinka, Gehlen disturbances, ?! including focal retrograde amnesia. This case therefore combines all features of anatomicobehavioural interrelations for retro- grade episodic amnesia, as predicted by Markowitsch s hypothesis. '!* In addition, the overlap between episodic and semantic distur- bances of old memories is in line with the assumption that these two memory systems have to be viewed more as a continuum than as sharply divisible entities: semantic informa- tion is generalised, repeated episodic informa- tion and metamemory and memory for the temporal order of events. Further- more, the prefrontal cortex is viewed as acting in monitoring or supervising environmental stimulation, or as applying strategies. All of these functions have, however, a closer affinity to the dorsolateral than to the orbitofrontal aspects of the frontal lobes. Damage to this region is assumed to induce changes in personality and emotional behav- iour. * Brazzelli et al*! described a patient with bilateral frontal and some additional cin- gular and temporal damage who had severe amnesia, most likely including a failure to retrieve old memories although formal testing of retrograde memory could not be accom- plished due to her incapacity to provide any kind of account. Recent O PET studies pro- vide further evidence for a prefrontal involve- ment in verbal and pictorial episodic memory retrieval. ** In conclusion, the prefrontal cortex con- tributes to memory retrieval (or memory ecphory) both by providing the impetus or trigger for an active search of the engrams (stored at other places and most likely in a net- work-like fashion'*) and by its capacity as a time sensitive organiser. As mentioned above, autobiographical memory is composed of per- sonally relevant and temporal knowledge. The temporal structuring or ordering of informa- tion is apparently necessary for its successful ecphory and retrieval. Results from single cases with prefrontal damage strongly support this view. ** The patient s subnormal perfor- mance in all three tests on cognitive flexibility (and therefore a frontal lobe function) confirm the view,",
        "other": "that the ecphory of old autobiographical memories relies heavily on an activation of the right lateral temporofrontal junction area, but that probably only some comple- mentary left hemispheric damage to these regions will lead to major and persistent retrograde amnesia. Alternatively, the dis- connection between major prefrontal and posterior cortical regions may provide a basis for retrograde amnesia. (Ff Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1996; 61: 304-310) Keywords: retrograde amnesia; memory; medial temporal lobe In recent years evidence for an anatomical dis- sociation of anterograde and retrograde mem- ory functions has accumulated. ! While the essential bottleneck structures, relevant for information transmission for long term storage have largely been established, \" there is still a substantial lack of consistency with respect to the brain regions implicated in focal retrograde amnesia. '?!3 The structures most often impli- cated in focal retrograde amnesia are situated in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, with some authors emphasising the importance of one structure or the other, and other authors assuming that only the combined and bilateral damage of portions of both frontal and temporal regions are necessary for the appearance of a fullblown retrograde amnesic syndrome. This inconsistency is enhanced by the currently widely accepted dissociation of different mem- ory systems of which the episodic semantic dis- tinction is the most common one. \" Episodic memories are those which can be traced back with respect to time and locus, whereas seman- tic memories signify those of a general nature (knowledge of the world) . In a recent the generalised (episodic plus semantic) deficiency of brain damaged patients at the stage of memory encoding may hold for the level of information retrieval as well, although it may be more distinct in the non-damaged brain. ' The episodic memory system is most likely more sensitive to brain damage than the knowledge system: episodic information is unique, > whereas semantic memories may derive from episodic ones through generalisa- tion and repetition. Furthermore, episodic memories for ecphory probably need a syn- chronised activation of affect coding structures of the limbic system (amygdala) . (Ecphory denotes the process by which retrieval cues interact with stored information so that an image or a representation of the information in question appears. ) The temporopolar orbitofrontal junction area will not be the locus of the engrams, but only a necessary mediator. ' ? Although we favour this region as the principal locus for memory ecphory, alternatively the disconnec- tion between major prefrontal and posterior cortical regions may provide a basis for retro- grade amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is cer- tainly a multifaceted phenomenon which can accompany various kinds of diseases and which can occur after damage to quite diver- gent brain loci. '?4?7 ROLE OF THE FRONTAL CORTEX IN RETRIEVAL Results from studies in patients with selective prefrontal damage usually do not indicate sig- nificant retrieval deficits. Instead, only the active, effortful engagement in ecphorising information may be disturbed. * Other fea- tures of mnemonic information processing which are altered after prefrontal damage include aspects of expressed by Kopelman, that test results in this domain are better predictors for retrograde memory performance than antero- grade memory tests. ROLE OF THE TEMPORAL CORTEX IN RETRIEVAL Penfield * has elucidated many of the phenom- ena occurring during electrical stimulation of the temporal lobe. One of his findings was the appearance of what he called psychical responses : reproductions of past personal experiences which he attributed to the (lateral) temporal cortex. Recently Fink et al * similarly found with PET blood flow measurements a strongly increased activation in the anterior temporal regions in response to ecphorising autobiographical material. In summary, both case descriptions of epileptic patients with temporal lobe involvement and functional imaging data in normal human subjects indi- cate a role of lateral temporal portions in memory retrieval. The anterolateral temporal cortex most likely provides the connection to the posterior cortical centres of integration and therefore to the major storage places of the engrams. EMOTION AND MEMORY Some studies point to emotional changes after brain damage. '**** The recent speculation that the right hemisphere is principally engaged in episodic memory retrieval and the left in semantic memory retrieval, is in line with such a view as episodic memories are usually more emotional than semantic ones. Autobiographical information is probably rep- resented in a more complex way than semantic information and needs an involvement from the left language representing hemisphere as well as from the right emotional one. The case of an adolescent patient with automatic but not consciously reflected memory retrieval demonstrates this point. It is not unlikely that the ecphory of episodic, but not of semantic, memory involves non-cortical limbic structures as well as the cortical ones, which primarily represent stored information. '? The basolateral limbic circuit, composed of portions of the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the medial thala- mus constitutes a basis for a network impli- Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 12, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com Right temporofrontal cortex as critical locus for the ecphory of old episodic memories cated in emotional memory processing. ***! The region of the medial thalamus can fur- thermore be regarded as a central gating sta- tion for consciousness* and therefore for the active, reflective processing, and associating of old memories. The mediodorsal nucleus not only projects to the prefrontal cortex, but especially to those portions of the temporal cortex as well which are implicated in the ecphory of old memories namely, the tempo- ral pole (area 38) . ?7 On the corticocortical level, the temporopolar and the ventrolateral prefrontal areas are bidirectionally intercon- nected by the uncinate fascicle. '* Emotional flattening is a frequent concomi- tant in patients with retrograde amnesia, both of organic and psychogenic origin. ' ?* Taking all this evidence together, it is likely that dam- age to the temporofrontal junction areas may result in a blockade of access to stored engrams, particularly to those which require an emotional flavour for ecphory as well. ?> WHY IS THERE SUCCESSFUL RETRIEVAL OF MEMORIES ACQUIRED AFTER BRAIN DAMAGE WITHOUT THE RIGHT TEMPOROFRONTAL JUNCTION AREA? Patients with selective temporofrontal damage are still able to acquire new information long term after the insult and subsequently recall it long term. This recall must therefore occur via routes different from the damaged tempo- rofrontal areas. The plasticity of the nervous system may lead to rewiring or rerouting of information acquired after the brain damage. Or the existence of hierarchically ordered recall systems can be assumed, similar to the models proposed for memory encoding after damage of relevant bottleneck structures. With respect to the differential retrieval of information acquired after brain damage (but not before brain damage) , the additional requirement is that the process of information consolidation implies the immediate establish- ment of a retrieval path. In the intact brain this retrieval path would principally and primarily involve the temporofrontal junction areas. In the brain with damage to this region an imme- diate retrieval path would be established to other, intact structures, lower in hierarchy, and less accurate and precise in retrieval. The proposal made by several authors implicitly or explicitly that the storage of the memory content is composed according to landmarks, may have the effect that after brain damage events which occurred before that landmark cannot be recalled, whereas those stored thereafter can be. * This view might also be in accordance with Wolpaw s that brain damage may disrupt the association between memories due to the missing link (in the temporofrontal junction area) which is neces- sary for the organised triggering (in the frontal portion) and access (in the temporal portion) to the engrams. * We are grateful to David Emmans for improvement of the lan- guage.

I suspect that doctors, just as novelists, can suffer from writer s block although in the case of the medical profession more perhaps from lack of time rather than from a failure of inspiration. Which explanation applies to Ovid Vere, in Heart and science, is not entirely clear. Thomas Mann s encyclo- pedia is one I have tried to emulate but as yet with no success in finding a willing publisher! Samuel Fohnson, 1779, Lives of the English poets Dryden It is a rare kind of giblet porridge, made of the giblets of a couple of young geese, stodged full of meteors, orbs, spheres, track, hideous draughts, dark characters, white forms, and radiant lights, designed not only to please appetite, and indulge luxury; but it is also phys- ical, being an approved medicine to purge choler: for it is propounded by Morena, as a receipt to cure their fathers of their choleric humours: and were it written in characters as barbarous as the words, might very well pass for a doctor s bill. Gustave Flaubert, 1856-7, Madam Bovary Emma looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. Why hadn t she at any rate one of those silent, earnest husbands who work at their books all night and end up, by the time that rheumatism sets in at sixty, wearing a string of decorations on their ill-fitting dress-coats! She would have liked this name of Bovary, that was hers, to be famous, on view at the book-shops, always cropping up in the papers, known all over France. But Charles had no ambition. Wilkie Collins, 1883, Heart and science His restless hand unlocked a drawer, and took out a manuscript work on medicine of his own writing. Surely, he thought, I may finish a chapter, before I go to sea tomorrow? Thomas Mann, 1924, The magic mountain Famous European specialists, physicians, psycholo- gists, and economists will share in the composition of this encyclopedia of suffering, and the general editorial bureau at Lugano will act as the reservoir to collect all the articles which shall flow into it. . . This great work will not neglect the belletrist in so far as he deals with human suffering: a volume is projected which shall contain a compilation and brief analysis of such mas- terpieces of the world s literature as come into ques- tion depicting one or other kind of conflict for the consolation and instruction of the suffering.

Patients showed disorientation to time and place, impaired recent memory and memorizing capacity; immediate and remote memory were preserved. Despite impaired performance intelligence quotients (IQ) , verbal IQ was relatively spared. Patients also showed disconnection symptoms including bilateral crossed visuomotor ataxia and alexia to stimuli presented in the right visual field. In both cases, the tumour of the splenium had provoked surrounding oedema extending to the left parietal and occipital lobes. Keywords: Splenium, amnesia, agraphia, tumour, disconnection Introduction It is well-known that memory impairment is caused by the lesions of the limbic system, particularly the hipocampus or anterior thalamus. However, only rarely has a similar deficit been caused by a lesion of the cingulate gyrus. Valenstein et al. [1] have described a patient with memory impairment that is called retrosplenial amnesia . It was associated with a haematoma that had originated from an arterio- venous malformation and was located between the splenium of the corpus callosum and the trigone of the left lateral ventricle. These suggested that the memory impairment was caused by interruption of an alternate pathway from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus. Reports concerning retrosplenial amnesia largely concern cerebrovascular lesions as opposed to brain tumours [2, 3]. This study reports two patients with tumours arising adjacent to the splenium of the corpus callosum to cause Case reports Case 1 A 62-year-old, right-handed man with 12 years of educational history was admitted to the hospital on 2 June 2003. He presented with a 1-month history of morning headache in the right frontal region, as well as vertigo. He also had manifested untidiness and memory disturbance for 1 month. Visual acuity was well preserved and visual fields displayed no remarkable constrictions. He showed no cranial nerve disturbances or sensorimotor deficits. He was alert and co-operative during a series of neuropsychological examinations, although he was in an amnestic state with disorientation and loss of recent memory. His speech was fluent and not aphasic. Objective naming, reading of letters and verbal comprehension were normal.

In addition to the symptoms described above, which were attributable to cerebral hemispheric lesions, inter- hemispheric disconnection signs were observed; although tactile object naming was normal, bilateral crossed visuomotor ataxia and alexia for stimuli presented in the right visual field were elicited. His verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was 100; perfor- mance IQ 75; and full IQ 89 by the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R) . By the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) , both verbal and visual memory were clearly disturbed (Table I) . He could perform nearly all self-care activities and walk without a cane, but he often set out in the wrong direction from his hospital room. Although he should make notes for memory aids, he could not write because of agraphia. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed a tumour between the left splenium and left occipital lobe, with surrounding oedema extending to the left parietal lobe. Following injection of gadolinium, a cystic component was enhanced in an irregular annular pattern (Figure 1) . Total resection of the tumour was performed on 24 June. Post-operative histopathologic examination identified the tumour metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. Post-operatively, orientation and memory improved. Although very mild alexia, Figure 1. Case 1.

She was alert and co-operative. She had no gross neurologic deficits except for right hemianopsia. Neuropsychological examination disclosed amnesia with disorientation and recent memory loss. She showed no aphasia, but acaluculia, alexia, amnestic agraphia, constructional apraxia, ideomotor and ideational apraxia and right-left confusion were seen. She often set out in the wrong direction from her hospital room, could not recognize her own house or nearby streets by appearance and could not locate well-known cities on a map. She had no unilateral spatial neglect. In addition to the symptoms described above, which were thought to reflect cerebral hemispheric lesions, bilateral crossed visuomotor ataxia, colour anomia in the right visual field and tactile objective anomia were demonstrated.

As she had to be watched during bathing and moving to the bathroom, his daughter helped her in these activities. For walking, she needed help because she always had lost her way and forgot what she was doing in her ward for inpatients because of amnesia. MRI of the brain demonstrated a tumour in the posterior half of the corpus callosum and parietooccipital lobe, with surrounding oedema. These masses enhanced heterogeneously, while a cystic component showed irregular ring enhancement after intravenous admin- istration of gadolinium (Figure 2) . Surgery was performed on 16 January 2004; the post-operative histopathologic diagnosis was glioblastoma. Post- operatively, disorientation and memory disturbance were persisted. Spatial orientation showed transient improvement, but symptoms gradually became worse and total aphasia developed after 2 months. Discussion Both patients showed disorientation as to time including date and time of day and places. Recent memory and capacity to memorize were disturbed, while immediate and remote memory was preserved. Despite performance IQ impairment, verbal IQ was relatively intact. In both patients the lesion respon- sible was a tumour located in the splenium of Figure 2. Case 2. Magnetic resonance images show a tumour centered in the splenium of the corpus callosum and parietoocci- pital lobe, with surrounding oedema. The masses are enhanced heterogeneously, and a cystic component is enhanced in an irregular annular fashion after intravenous administration of gadolinium. the corpus callosum, accompanied by oedema expanding from the periphery of the tumour to the left parietooccipital regions. Both showed memory disturbance without aphasia, as well as alexia and agraphia. Although there have been a number of reports concerning retrosplenial amnesia, most of these described cerebrovascular lesions; little has been reported with respect to brain tumours. Never- theless, many stroke-related reports described amnesia in cases also showing symptoms of corpus callosum interruption by a retrosplenial lesion and detailed analysis of patients with neoplasms may disclose that tumour-related memory impairment arising at this site is not a rare event. Iwasaki et al. [5] and Tanaka et al. [6] investigated amnesic symptoms and memory disturbance caused by a tumour at this location, involving verbal and visual memory disturbance and, in some cases, topographic disturbance [7-9]. As an underlying mechanism, not only retrosplenial amnesia as reported by Valenstein et al. [1] is a consideration, but also fibre disconnection affecting memory- related pathways from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus nucleus [10, 11]. Some previous reports have described topographic disorientation [7-9]. As case 2 showed mainly RIGHTS LIN Kd Brain Inj Downloaded from informahealthcare. com by University of North Texas on 12/01/14 For personal use only 676 A. Osawa et al. Table III.

Case 1 had a metastatic tumour that was mainly extra-parenchymal. The metastasis was relatively small, but oedema surrounding it appeared to involve fibres involved in memory. In case 2, a tumour expanding from the splenium of the corpus callosum to the left parietooccipital lobes infiltrated and impaired these fibre connections. As for accompanying neuropsychological symp- toms, aphasia was absent in both cases (Table ID) . Whether writing with the left hand was impaired selectively as a symptom of callosal interruption was unclear because of bilateral agraphia. Both cases showed alexia for stimul in the left visual field and bilateral crossed optic ataxia. Case 2 but not case 1 showed apraxia of the left hand and impaired tactile naming. Pathways for action, writing and tactile perception lie in the body of the corpus callosum, while those for vision lie in the splenium. Therefore, lesions responsible for apraxia of the left hand and impaired of amnestic syndrome with Gerstmann s syndrome due to malignant lymphoma in retrosplenial region.

On the other hand, lesions responsible for alexia in the left visual field and bilateral crossed optic ataxia were suspected to be in the splenium. Among the cases, case 1 had a tumour arising just outside the brain parenchyma that compressed the retrosplenial region, while case 2 had a tumour invasively expanding the splenium of the corpus callosum, so symptoms of corpus callosum interruption appeared over a wider area. The cases underscore the point that brain tumours may cause a variety of cognitive dysfunction requiring thorough evaluation. References 1.

'Department of Psychology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy 2CCS-fMRI, Koelliker Hospital, Turin, Italy Puzzle Rehabilitation Center, Turin, Italy The use of 3D video games in memory rehabilitation has been explored very little. A virtual navigation task allows participants to encode the spatial layout of the virtual environment and activate areas involved in memory process- ing. We describe the rehabilitation of a 24-year-old man with traumatic brain injury presenting memory deficits, and evaluate the efficacy of a navigational training program measuring neuropsychological changes and [MRI modification cerebral activations. Memory improvement appears to be present both after navigational training and in follow-up testing. Furthermore, fMRI data suggest that this training may increase activation of the hip- pocampal and parahippocampal brain regions. The results suggest that intensive training in virtual navigational tasks may result in an enhancement of memory function in brain-damaged adults. Keywords: Memory rehabilitation; Computer-based training; Virtual reality; Traumatic brain injury; (MRI. Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause a vari- able range of cognitive impairments usually in the domains of memory, attention, and executive functioning; memory deficit in particular is one of the most common and disabling impairments (Vakil, 2005) . The utilization of 3D interactive Virtual Reality (VR) environments in neuropsycho- logical rehabilitation enables ecologically valid and dynamic training to be provided (Rose, Brooks, & Rizzo, 2005) . The crucial role of the hippocampal and parahip- pocampal cortices in declarative memory has been demonstrated, starting from the seminal report of the H. M. case (Scoville & Milner, 1957) ; human hippocampal formation is related to different declarative memory subsystems such as declara- tive learning (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1991) , spa- tial memory (Maguire et al. , 1998) , and verbal association (Henke et al. , 1999) . The hippocam- pus and related Woollett, Glensman, and Maguire (2008) assumed that hip- pocampal activations are more likely to be observed when the knowledge acquired concerns a complex and detailed large-scale spatial layout. Aim of the study The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of navigational training using a 3D VR videogame on both spatial and verbal memory in TBI patient rehabilitation. Our hypothesis is that navigation in a VR environment is an ecological task that is effective in activating hippocampal formation, improving both spatial and verbal memory. The use of functional neuroimaging has been shown to be a useful tool for assessing outcomes in neuropsy- chological rehabilitation (Laatsch et al. , 2007) . Therefore, in the present study, we explored the changes in cerebral activation in the medial tempo- ral lobe through functional neuroimaging (FMRI) . The assumption is that increased activation in this brain area is associated with improved functions associated with that area as shown by the positive correlations between the number of items retrieved and the signal intensity in the medial temporal lobe linked to the encoding processing (Fernandez et al. , 1998) . Case report The present study describes the rehabilitation of a 24-year-old right-handed man (W. P. ) , who had completed his compulsory education and worked as a storeman. His medical history was unremark- able until he was involved in a motor vehicle crash (05/06/2006) and sustained a TBI of moderate severity. He remained in a coma for 27 days and his maximum score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 5. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan performed the same day as the TBI showed the presence of hemorrhagic contusions in the bilateral frontal, temporal and parietal lobes (see Figure 8S) . Seven months after the TBI, the patient was admit- ted to the Puzzle Rehabilitation Center in Turin. Neuropsychological assessment on admission indi- cated the presence of a severe anterograde (both deficits in spatial learning (supraspan on Corsi s test) . Before the navigational memory training, the patient underwent standard rehabilitation proto- cols for 5 months. In particular, he performed a first rehabilitation session, lasting 2 months, during which information processing, sustained attention, and working memory were trained; then, he per- formed a second rehabilitation session, lasting 3 months, designed to improve the mnestic functions and consisting of learning lists of words. A com- parison of the results obtained before and after each of these two standard rehabilitation proto- cols revealed no significant difference in neuropsy- chological scores. Thus, the patient entered our experimental navigational memory protocol after 5 months of attention and memory rehabilitation followed by no cognitive improvements. The selection of this patient for our experimental protocol has therefore been motivated by the fact that general practice effects would not explain post- training improvements; also, spontaneous recovery is implausible as our training started | year after the traumatic event and no changes occurred in that lapse of time. METHODS Procedures The participant gave his informed written con- sent to participate in an experimental computerized program of navigational memory training, in accor- dance with the requirements of the local medical ethics committee and with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. The rehabilitation training was based on a nav- igational task, exploring part of a virtual town (London) from a ground-level perspective, using a computer videogame driving simulator (Midtown Madness 2, Microsoft Game Studios; Figure 1S) . The participant had previous experience of playing first-person videogames. The task was different from the original tasks of the videogame; the instruction to the participant was as follows: You must cut down poles and trees that you find all along the way ; the participant did not have access to a city map during the task. The aim of the instruction was to induce the participant to explore the virtual town extensively, avoiding Downloaded by [The Aga Khan University] at 21: 37 09 October 2014 reuse of the same roads; therefore, the spatial mem- ory task was implicit, while the explicit task was a simple game, one that the participant enjoyed. The training consisted of a series of 90-minute sessions three times a week (total length of interven- tion: 5 weeks) . In each training session the subject had a 7-minute break after every 20 minutes of navigation. The patient was evaluated before and immedi- ately after training by means of a standardized neuropsychological assessment. He was retested 2 months after the last memory training session; and once again | year after training. A comparison was then made of the subject s per- formance before and after intervention and in the follow-ups. Neuropsychological assessment The neuropsychological assessment consisted of a battery of cognitive tests assessing: spatial short-term memory, visuo-spatial learning, work- ing memory, verbal learning, frontal executive func- tions, and general cognitive impairment. Four par- allel and equivalent forms were used for all tests. Corsi Block-Tapping Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) The aim of the test is to provide a measure of short-term spatial memory. This task was given according to the procedure suggested by Spinnler and Tognoni (1987) . The experimental apparatus consisted of a board measuring 25 x35 cm on which 9 blocks (side 4. 5 cm) were fixed. A serial number identifying each block was visible only to the exam- iner. The participants were asked to reproduce a specific sequence of cubes in the same order as the examiner. Performance was defined by the longest sequence at which participants correctly recalled at least two out of three sequences. Corsi s Supraspan Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) This task was given according to the procedure suggested by Spinnler and Tognoni (1987) . The experimental apparatus was the same used in the Corsi Block-Tapping Test. A serial number iden- tifying each block was visible only to the exam- iner. The examiner touched a standard supraspan sequence of 8 blocks at a rate of | block every sec- ond. Immediately following the presentation, the VIRTUAL NAVIGATION IN MEMORY REHABILITATION 125 patient was asked to touch the blocks in the same order (immediate recall) . The same sequence of blocks was reproposed by the examiner until the subject could reproduce it correctly three consecu- tive times or after 18 consecutive trials. Five minutes after the last trial, the subject was again asked to reproduce the sequence of blocks (delayed recall) . The response to each presentation was scored on the basis of the probability of giving the correct response (or fragment of it) by chance (Carlesimo, Fadda, Bonci, & Caltagirone, 1993) . Backward digit span (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) The participant had to remember lists of increas- ing length of single-digit numbers and recall them in the opposite order. Performance was defined by the longest sequence at which participants correctly recalled at least two out of three sequences. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test - RAVLT (Lezak, 1995) This test measures verbal learning and consists of five learning trials of a 15-word list. The partici- pant was asked to repeat as many items as possible after each trial, and then to recall as many items as possible from the original list (immediate recall) . Delayed recall of the same list was assessed after 15 minutes (delayed recall) . Trail Making Test TMT A-B (Lezak, 1995) The aim of the test is to provide a measure of attentional-executive functioning. The participants were instructed to sequentially connect on a sheet 25 circles that in part A contained the numbers 1-25, and in part B the numbers 1-13 and the letters A-N. Part A required the participants to connect the circles in ascending sequence from | to 25; part B required them to connect the circles in an ascending sequence of alternating numbers and let- ters (1, A, 2, B, etc. ) . The total number of seconds required to complete parts A and B was measured separately. Phonemic fluency (Lezak, 1995) The participant was asked to produce in | minute as many words as possible beginning with F, A, and S. All results were compared considering the equivalent scores obtained in the different assess- ments. The equivalent score is a 5-point scale (0-4) , where 0 indicates a score that lies below the external Downloaded by [The Aga Khan University] at 21: 37 09 October 2014 126 CAGLIO ET AL. nonparametric tolerance limit of adjusted scores (under 95% of the population with 95% confi- dence) , and 4 indicates A performance equal to or greater than the mean of the adjusted scores, thus no longer distinguishing between scores found in the upper half of the distribution. Equivalent scores of 1, 2, and 3 are intermediate between 0 and 4 on a quasi-interval scale. An equivalent score of 0 will be considered below the normal range, with a controlled error risk (Capitani & Laiacona, 1988, 1997) . Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) (Rosen, Mohs, & Davis, 1996) This global rating scale is used to summarize whether an individual has cognitive impairments consistent with Alzheimer s disease. Test items assess various functions including language abil- ity, memory, ability to copy geometric figures, and orientation to current time and place. Patients are given a score for each area, with higher scores indicating more dysfunction. The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) (Wilson & Baddeley, 1985) This test was used to assess impairments in everyday memory functioning. We turned to the RBMT, a reliable instrument for detecting every- day memory impairments that reflect difficulties in real life . In the RBMT, two tasks (Story Recall and Route Recall subtests) assess everyday mem- ory demands, respectively, in verbal and in spatial learning domain. Story recall subtest. The experimenter read the short story only once and is then asked to recall as much as they can immediately upon finishing the paragraph. After 10 minutes have passed the patient is reminded of the story and asked to repeat it again. Scoring of the Story: a point is awarded for each event recalled. Maximum score = 21. Route recall subtest. The experimenter walks a route round the room that includes explicitly vis- iting five separate locations. The final stage of the route is the experimenter s starting position (there- fore, location 5 is the same as location 1) . Before they start, the experimenter tells the participant that they will be asked to do the same thing once the experimenter has finished. The experi- menter verbalizes what they are doing throughout the route. When the experimenter is finished, he asks the participant to repeat the same path, start- ing from the same position (Immediate condition) . Approximately 15 minutes later the participant is asked to repeat the route (Delayed condition) . Scoring of the Route: a point is awarded for each stage visited in the correct order. Any stage that is erroneously added is considered a false positive and a point is deducted. Maximum score=5. Functional neuroimaging assessment Functional magnetic resonance imaging is employed to record brain activity during the performance on a memory task using Paired Associate Learning (abstract words) as mnemonic content. During scanning, the participant was repeatedly verbally presented with seven pairs of words; then, outside the scanner, the patient was asked to recall the word pairs. The paradigm had a block design with 14 s of rest alternating with 28 s of activation condition. The paradigm consisted of 2 runs of 35 blocks (18 rest conditions, 17 active conditions) . During rest, the subject mentally counted from | to 10; during learning, he listened to 7 pairs of abstract words. BOLD imaging data were analyzed using the SPMS software in the MATLAB 7. 0 environment (Math Works Inc. , Natick, MA, USA) . The sub- ject s functional data underwent the following pre- processing steps: (1) slice scan time correction; (2) 3D motion correction; (3) normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard; (4) spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM; and (5) temporal filters linear trend removal and non-linear trend removal using a tem- poral high-pass filter (frequency pass = 0. 008 Hz) to remove drifts due to the scanner and other low frequency noises. The patient underwent three fMRI sessions: pre- VR-training, post-VR-training (after 2 months of navigational memory training) , and a follow-up session (2 months after discontinuation of the train- ing) . Statistical analysis was carried out in the context of the General Linear Model (GLM) . The resulting SPM ({t}s were thresholded at p<. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain (FWE correction) with a cluster size kp>25 voxels. We also used an explicit mask limiting our anal- ysis to the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions in order to study the variation of activ- ity in these areas, guided by our prior hypothesis. The resulting SPM {t}s were thresholded at <0. 05, Downloaded by [The Aga Khan University] at 21: 37 09 October 2014 corrected for False Discovery Rate (FDR cor- rection, <5% false positive) with a cluster size ke > 10 voxels. The voxel resolution of the func- tional sequences was 4x4x4 mm}. RESULTS Neuropsychological data The scores from the neuropsychological tests per- formed before and after navigational VR train- ing with video games are shown in Table 1. The effects of the training on performance were evalu- ated by comparing the scores of the first and later assessments; the raw scores were translated into equivalent scores and compared in this way. The participant in this study presented a post-VR-training improvement, showing better VIRTUAL NAVIGATION IN MEMORY REHABILITATION 127 performance in neuropsychological tests assess- ing visuo-spatial learning. In particular, improve- ments from pre-VR-training to post-VR-training were detected in the Corsi s supraspan delayed recall (from 4/8 to 8/8) and in RBMT Route delayed recall (from 0/5 to 4/5) , an ecologically valid measured of spatial memory, persisted at follow-ups. Comparing post-VR-training scores (three obser- vations) vs. pre-VR-training scores (three observa- tions) , using the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test, the following comparisons showed sig- nificant differences: RAVLT immediate recall (z adjusted= 1. 99, p=. 05) , Corsi s supraspan test, delayed recall (z adjusted= 1. 96, p=. 05) and Corsi s supraspan test, immediate recall (z adjusted = 2. 12, p=. 03) ; no significant differences were obtained in the following tests: RAVLT delayed recall, Digit span forward and backward, Corsi s block tapping test.

We found a rich pattern of activation in the post-VR-training session (see supplemental content Table 2S, Figure 3S) , including princi- pally the superior and middle temporal gyrus (bilaterally) , the frontal gyrus (bilaterally; BA 6, 8, 9) , the medial frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA9) , the right parahippocampal gyrus region, the right cuneus and precuneus. The follow-up session did not substantially dif- fer from the post-VR-training (Figure 5S, 6S, 7S, Table 4S, 5S, 6S) except for two small clusters in the left claustrum and in the left middle temporal gyrus (see supplemental content Table 7S) . No clusters of voxels were more activated in the pre-VR-training or follow-up sessions compared to the post-VR-training sessions. We found similar results for the explicit masked analysis, with more extended activations in the post-VR- compared to the pre-VR-training condi- tion (see supplemental content Table 3S, Figure 4S) and no differences between follow-up and post-VR- training. We can assume, on the basis of our clinical opinion, neuropsychological retesting and struc- tural MRI images, that the patient was stable enough to not show evident recovery in | year. Even though we cannot exclude the presence of subtle changes, we believe that it is improbable that the improvement after the memory navigation training could be the consequence of spontaneous changes (Annoni, Beer, & Kesselring, 1992; Sherer, Madison, & Hannay, 2000) . DISCUSSION In this study, we measured, in a stabilized TBI patient, the changes before and after VR naviga- tional training with a 3D videogame in neuropsy- chological tests (assessing spatial and verbal mem- ory and attentive/executive functions) and fMRI activation of the hippocampal and parahippocam- pal brain regions involved in memory processing. Our findings showed that a clear improvement in visual-spatial memory learning was observed in our patient after navigational VR training; in particular, enhanced performance was observed in delayed recall. This outcome allowed us to con- clude that spatial memory could improve through the exploration of a new and complex environ- ment. A study by Matheis et al. (2007) examined the usefulness of virtual reality to assess learning and memory in individuals with TBI. It demon- strated that data regarding integrated memory abil- ities can be obtained empirically within a consistent and controllable environment that is similar to the real-world. VIRTUAL NAVIGATION IN MEMORY REHABILITATION 129 Our results showed no clear effect of VR-memory training on immediate recall; only in Corsi s supras- pan task the immediate recall seems to improve, but a trend to improvement was present before VR-memory training. These findings are not sur- prising, because the immediate recall is only partly related to the function of medial temporal regions; in fact, immediate recalls is related to the work- ing memory fronto-parietal network activation; after repeated exposure of the same materials (as in Corsi s Supraspan Test) , the immediate recall become connected also with the medial temporal regions (Wolk & Dickerson, 2011) . This pattern of results provides some considerations. One possible interpretation of the results is that the enhancement in spatial memory could in part be a consequence of spatial implicit learning training on acquiring spatial knowledge during navigation: indeed, the participant did not have to learn a route but rather to conduct an extensive exploration of the",

It has been shown that navigation of a virtual environment allows participants to encode the spatial layout of the environment and activate a network of areas, such as the hippocampus, which are involved in mem- ory processing (Maguire et al. , 1998) . , the cerebellum (bilaterally) , the left and right hippocampus, and the left anterior cingulate. These activations were more extended compared to the pre-VR-training (Table 2, 1S, 2S, Figure 1, 2S, 3S) and in particular included left ventral tegmental area (VTA) and left hippocampus, the TABLE 2 Post-VR-training > Pre-VR-training N ke Area BA MNI (x, y, z) ZE R (mm) 1 498 LVTA * 4 -24-12 6. 73 2 L Hippocampus * 26 20 -6 5. 34 1 2 69 L Medial Frontal Gyrus 10 4 52-8 5. 74 0 3 224 L Medial Frontal Gyrus 9 05424 5. 47 1 R Medial Frontal Gyrus 9 6 46 32 4. 94 0 4 53 R Parahippocampal Gyrus 30 16 48 0 4. 84 0 5 33 R Cuneus 18 20 76 30 4. 53 0 R Precuneus 31 10 74 32 4. 49 0 Brain activations in the post-VR-training minus pre-VR-training conditions, whole brain.

Downloaded by [The Aga Khan University] at 21: 37 09 October 2014 left medial frontal gyrus (BA 10) virtual town. In other words, the implicit spatial memory involved in the training task increased specific spa- tial cognitive functions. Our hypothesis was that the navigational task could have activated the medial temporal lobe network involved in both spatial and verbal memory learning. This supposition is supported by the functional neuroimaging assessment, which shows increased metabolism in the left hippocampus and the right parahippocampal cortex during a verbal task after navigational VR-memory training. Increases in cerebral activity after navigational VR training were also found along the mesolimbic network (VTA and medial prefrontal cortex) involved in the reward. In particular, we assume that the naviga- tional VR training activated a VTA-hippocampal loop that controls the entry of information into long-term memory (Lisman & Grace, 2005) . As suggested by Green and Baveller (2003) in their paper on the effect of videogames on visual attention, it could be speculated that the attentional and executive functions were primarily affected by the training. However, the improvement in memory, in this case, was not associated with a significant improvement in executive and attentional functions. Also the functional neuroimaging, in this case, does not support a significant increase in metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved in executive functions. Interestingly, our results pointed out that improvement in spatial but not verbal memory appeared to be sustained after a 1-year no-contact follow-up period. This dissociation suggests that Downloaded by [The Aga Khan University] at 21: 37 09 October 2014 130 CAGLIO ET AL. the long-term effect of rehabilitation training is maintained if daily training is performed; clinical investigation suggests that in daily life the par- ticipant of this study performs more spatial than verbal activities. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our findings suggest that virtual nav- igational training might support an enhancement of memory functions in brain-damaged adults. According to Brooks and McNeil (1999) , we showed that VR can be a useful tool in cogni- tive rehabilitation and that training in a virtual environment can transfer to improve real world performance. We hope that this tool can be applied not only to individuals with TBI but also to other patients with memory deficits. Our study showed that nav- igational memory training was associated with an increased activation of hippocampal and parahip- pocampal brain regions involved in memory processing.

Yves von Cramon> Departments of 'Psychology and 7Neurology, University of California, Davis, >VA Medical Center, Martinez, California, USA, Physiological Psychology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, and Department of Neurology, Max-Planck-Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience, Leipzig, Germany Summary Extensive neuropsychological testing is reported on two chronic patients with combined temporopolar and prefrontal damage, dominantly left-hemispheric, and, as control, one chronic patient with bi-hemispheric prefrontal damage. The principal finding is that combined temporofrontal damage, but not substantial prefrontal damage alone, results in marked retrograde memory deficits while leaving intelligence and new learning relatively unimpaired. Although their general world knowledge was good, the temporopolar patients Keywords: retrograde amnesia; episodic memory Abbreviations: BA = Brodmann area; SI = signal intensity Correspondence to: Neal Kroll, Department of Psychology, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA demonstrated retrograde memory impairments on several tests of past events and faces of previously famous people. With respect to retrograde autobiographical memory, one of the temporopolar patients was severely impaired and the other was judged to be moderately impaired. The control patient appeared to be normal. These results, together with corresponding data from related single case and dynamic imaging studies, strongly support a crucial role of the temporofrontal junction area in the ecphory of old memories. Introduction Functional localization is a major aim in brain research of the anatomical substratum for memory (Alzheimer, amnesia are deficient only with respect to encoding new episodic memories, or are also deficient in their encoding of new information at the knowledge level. A recent study supports the hypothesis of combined impairments (Verfaellie and Cermak, 1994) . Until recently, the hypothesis that anterograde and retrograde amnesia might result from separate and independent impairments was regarded as unproven 1378 N. E. A. Kroll et al. (Meudell, 1992, p. 67) and Squire and Alvarez (1995) formulated that retrograde memory loss almost always occurs in association with anterograde amnesia (p. 169) . A few years earlier, Squire et al. (1989) reported similar degrees of retrograde amnesia in patients with amnesia due to Korsakoff s disease, anoxia or ischaemia, thalamic infarction, and an unknown aetiology. This led them to suggest that the structures damaged in amnesia support memory storage, retrieval, or both, during a lengthy period of reorganization, after which representations in memory can become independent of these structures (p. 828) . Single case descriptions, however, suggest that certain cortical regions are relevant for recall, but not for information encoding. The present work provides further evidence of retrograde memory loss without learning impairment. It also addresses hemisphere-specific information retrieval and the role of frontal and temporal cortices. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of retrograde amnesia are among the most difficult endeavours in neuropsychological testing (Markowitsch, 1992) . This is due to a combination of factors. (i) The personal history of an individual is frequently difficult to determine. (ii) Estimating losses from world knowledge (Sagar et al. , 1988) , dorsolateral prefrontal (Shimamura et al. , 1995) , and in diencephalic damage as in Korsakoff s psychosis (van der Horst, 1923; Bouman and Gruenbaum, 1929; Krauss, 1930; Griinthal, 1932, 1939; Kleist, 1934; Benedek and Juba, 1940, 1941; Williams and Zangwill, 1950) . A loss in the feeling of time was also reported for a 67 year old patient who had focal atrophy in the orbitofrontal cortex and numerous Pick bodies in medial temporal lobe structures (Hodges and Gurd, 1994) . At the beginning of his memory deterioration, he had selective deficits in recalling context-rich and time-specific autobiographical events. The authors suggest that fronto- striatal pathway damage was responsible for the deficit. Mention should also be made of the symptom of chronotaraxis which was reported after mediodorsal stereotaxic thalamotomy (Spiegel et al. , 1955, 1956; Wycis, 1972) . Chronotaraxis is characterized by an inability to identify the date; the patient may not know the time of the day, may make incorrect statements regarding the season of the year though this is obvious if he looks through the window (Spiegel et al. , 1956, p. 97) . Content-specific forms of retrograde memory loss have, on the one hand, been found in cases with focal brain damage (Markowitsch, 1995b) , and, on the other hand, in demented cases (Hodges et al. , 1992; Greene and Hodges, 1996) . Some patients with a dominant damage focus in temporofrontal regions of one hemisphere, together with minor damage in the other, show a clear-cut division between preservation of (world) knowledge and a loss of autobiographic (episodic) information or vice versa (De Renzi et al. , 1987; N. Kapur et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993c; Calabrese et al. , 1996) . Other patients with still more selective damage or with damage in more posterior cortical regions may manifest more subtle forms of retrograde amnesia. For example, dissociations were described between preserved knowledge of people, but impaired knowledge of events (e. g. regarding to what happened to these people) (Ellis et al. , 1989; McCarthy and Warrington, 1992) or vice versa (Reinkemeier et al. , 1997) . Demented patients in particular may manifest an impairment in semantic memory as defined by Hodges et al. (1992) . That is, they may demonstrate severe anomia, a reduced vocabulary and a major impairment in single-word comprehension (cf. Hodges etal. , 1994; Hodges and Patterson, 1995) . More recently, Greene and Hodges (1996) suggested a further fractionation of remote memory in dementia, namely that in autobiographic memory versus famous person knowledge. Deficits in the identification of famous names and faces were attributed to a loss of semantic knowledge regarding famous persons, while a retrieval deficit contributed to the proper name anomia, which was in addition to the semantic deficit (Greene and Hodges, 1996) . With respect to remote memory processing, Graham and Hodges (1997) recently found that patients with Alzheimer s disease show a temporally graded loss with poor recall of recent memories; whereas patients with semantic dementia showed the reverse pattern. Findings obtained in normal subjects with dynamic imaging techniques argue for a hemisphere-specific dissociation between retrieval of information from the episodic and the knowledge domains, with the first being associated with the right and the second with the left hemisphere (Markowitsch, 1995b; Nyberg et al. , 1996) . Considered collectively, these data speak for a modular representation of memory, probably with some commonly shared components. Preferred brain loci in cases with selective retrograde amnesia By selective retrograde amnesia, we mean severe and lasting retrograde amnesia in the presence of the ability to acquire new episodic information. N. Kapur (1993) introduced the term focal retrograde amnesia to describe the deficit in such patients. Usually, patients with selective retrograde amnesia have some disturbances in anterograde memory domains as well; however, their preserved ability to acquire new long term declarative information distinguishes them from other amnesics. The first cases of major retrograde amnesia with no, or only minor, anterograde memory disturbances were reported in the early 1980s (Roman-Campos et al. , 1980; Goldberg et al. , 1981, 1982; Andrews et al. , 1982) . Goldberg and co- workers had an early CT-scan of their patient s brain. The trauma-induced damage was widespread, extending from the right posterior temporal lobe down to the pontine mesencephalic junction area. The 36-year-old patient considered himself to be between 16 and 18 years old and recognized neither wife or children, nor other details of his former private or professional background. However, this case s behaviour closely resembles that of patients with psychogenic amnesia (cf. Markowitsch, 1990) and may, therefore, not be relevant to the present discussion. N. Kapur etal. (1989, 1992) reported two cases with retrograde amnesia as a prominent syndrome. In patient L. T. , the trauma-caused (horse riding accident) lesion was bilateral, but predominantly right-sided, and affected the temporopolar and the orbitofrontal cortex. Her brain damage closely resembles that of case E. D. of Markowitsch et al. (1993a, b) , discussed below. Other cases with temporal damage and retrograde amnesia have been reported. O Connor et al. (1992) reported a case resulting from a herpes simplex encephalopathy, and De Renzi and Lucchelli (1993) reported a case resulting from a severe trauma. Both of these cases were characterized by the ability to learn new information (though De Renzi and Lucchelli s case was an abnormally fast forgetter) and both had their main deficits on the autobiographical old memory level. In addition, Yoneda et al. (1992) briefly described a case of a 21-year-old right handed patient with isolated retrograde amnesia after encephalitis-based dysfunction of the left temporal lobe. Case E. D. , of Markowitsch et al. (1993a, b) , was similar to that of N. Kapur et al. (1992) . E. D. had fallen from a horse and had the same combination of lesioned structures; the lesion was bilateral, but dominantly on the right side, Retrieval of old memories 1379 and damage involved the temporopolar and portions of the orbitofrontal cortex; i. e. , regions which are combined by the uncinate fascicle (Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992) . Also E. D. closely resembled case L. T. behaviourally, having a preserved ability to learn episodic information anew, but being grossly impaired in the ability to retrieve old episodic information. Recently, Calabrese etal. (1996) provided detailed neuropsychological information on a patient with a severe and enduring loss of old autobiographical memories after herpes simplex type I infection. The patient was examined neuropsychologically, 2 years after the infection, with MRI and single photon emission computerized tomography. Brain damage was found mainly in the right temporofrontal region, but minor left-sided damage to this region appears possible. The patient manifested severe retrograde memory deficits with respect to episodic old memories and more moderate deficits in tests of general knowledge. Mention should also be made of the reports of Della Sala et al. (1993) on cases with frontal lobe damage. Their patients had problems with the retrieval of autobiographical events from the past. They concluded that the prefontal cortex is involved in the effortful retrieval of remote information, without being solely responsible for them. In addition, Lucchelli et al. (1995) reported on two patients who recovered unexpectedly from major retrograde amnesia. One of them had had a left thalamic infarction, the other mild head trauma. It should be noted that recent evidence from PET studies with normal subjects, testing episodic memory processing, pointed to an involvement of the prefrontal cortex in episodic memory (S. Kapur et al. , 1994; Tulving et al. , 1994a, b, c, 1996) . However, due to technical limitations, a possible contribution from the temporopolar cortex could not be excluded. The PET studies resulted in another important finding which Tulving et al. (1994a) termed the hemispheric encoding, retrieval asymmetry (HERA) . They found that for encoding of episodic information the left prefrontal cortex was differentially activated whereas, for retrieval, the right prefrontal cortex was activated. These findings correspond quite well to the predominance of right-sided brain damage in cases with selective episodic retrograde amnesia (Goldberg etal. , 1981, 1982; N. Kapur etal. , 1992; Morris et al. , 1992; O Connor et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993a, b) . However, patients with focal damage in the right prefrontal cortex do not have retrieval deficits, raising some questions about the functional meaning of the PET activation studies (Swick and Knight, 1996) . The patient of N. Kapur etal. (1994a) , with mainly semantic memory disorders, had symmetrical bilateral brain damage, mainly in the lateral temporal lobes. The authors suggested that his right anterior temporal lesion played a part in his poor autobiographical memory for specific episodes , while his poor performance on pre-1980 items on the Dead-or-Alive test was related to the left anterior temporal lobe damage (p. 34) . (The Dead-or-Alive test is a semantic memory test. ) Yoneda etal. (1994) described a correlation between atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus 1380 N. E. A. Kroll et al. and the density of retrograde amnesia in encephalitis patients. Hokkanen et al. (1995) found isolated retrograde amnesia for autobiographical material in a patient with acute left temporal encephalitis. Finally, we would like to comment on semantic dementia which, of course, includes intellectual disturbances beyond retrograde amnesia. A dissociation between relatively preserved autobiographical memory and semantic retrograde amnesia can frequently be found in these cases, in which atrophy of the inferolateral temporal lobe often involves predominantly the left hemisphere (Hodges et al. , 1992, 1994; Hodges and Patterson, 1995) . Case descriptions We investigated the intellectual and memory abilities, particularly the older memory, of three male, right-handed Caucasian patients of average intelligence. All of them had had traumatic brain injury in young adulthood: Patient A. A. at the age of 24 years (bike/car accident, 1974) ; Patient B. B. at the age of 30 years (knocked off his bike by somebody with a club and robbed, 1975) and Patient C. C. at the age of 24 years (motorcycle accident, 1977) . At the time of testing, Patient A. A. was 44, Patient B. B. 49, and Patient C. C. 41 years old. Patients A. A. and B. B. were both veterans. They were tested over more than a dozen sessions each at the VA Medical Center in Martinez, California. Many of the tests used can be found in Lezak (1995) and in Spreen and Strauss (1991) . Most of the others, especially the German-language ones, were described in our previous publications (Markowitsch et al. , 1993a, b, c, 1994; von Cramon et al. , 1993) . Written informed consent was obtained from all three subjects. In addition to the three patients, a group of 18 healthy control adults were tested on some of the tests which lack published norms. These subjects were contracted via a newspaper advertisement and were tested in the University Psychology Laboratories in Davis, California. There were seven males and 11 females who ranged in age from 40 to 70 years with a mean age of 56. 7 years. All subjects were paid $10/h for their participation and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by the Human Subjects Review Committee, University of California, Davis. Patient A. A. Patient A. A. had 12 years of schooling; he is unemployed, but does volunteer work in a hospital. His coma duration after the accident had been 4 days. It was reported that he had been disoriented for an extended period after his accident. For example, he did not know who was the President (of the USA) , nor similar kinds of basic knowledge. His sister reports that when she saw him several weeks after the accident, he first assumed that her girl friend (whom he had not seen before) was his sister. During the interview, he stated that he can remember big moments from his youth, but he had to relearn many of his relatives. His memories seem flat or overlearned. He stated that his memories for recent events are much better now than they were during the first years after his accident, but that he still tends to forget quite a bit. Neuroradiological examination Patient A. A. s brain damage can be seen in Fig. 1. Both ventral frontal poles and temporopolar regions were damaged. In addition, most of the anterior two-thirds of his left temporal cortex was damaged. MRI was carried out in February 1992 (i. e. , 18 year post-injury) using a (Vista) 0. 5 Tesla scanner. MRI comprised sagittal and coronal T, -weighted (TR 550; TE 20) and transverse T, -weighted (TR SE 3000; TE 100) 10 mm sequences. Coronal T; -weighted images. Sections through the polar region of the frontal lobes reveal low signal intensities (SI) in the frontomarginal region of both prefrontal cortices. Whereas on the right the shallow hypointensity seems limited to the frontoorbital margin, the hypointense area on the left extends to the anterior gyrus rectus encroaching on the olfactory bulb and reaches medially to the superior rostral sulcus. On sections through the anterior third of the temporal lobes, low SI are seen in both temporal lobes, but particularly in the left. The temporopolar cortices are altered on both sides. The anterior 1. 5 cm of the right temporal pole is lesioned, whereas the extent of the left-sided hypointensity measures ~5 6 cm from the temporal pole comprising the middle and inferior temporal gyri, parts of the para- hippocampal gyrus, the anterior fusiform gyrus, and the lateral and inferior temporal white matter. With respect to the first temporal gyrus, only the anterior third appears altered; the temporal isthmus seems largely spared. The left inferior horn is enlarged to a transverse diameter of >2 cm and its presumably maximally widened tip merges with the surrounding hypointense area. The tip of the right inferior horn is at best slightly enlarged. The left-sided amygdaloid complex and the hippocampal formation is largely spared. The left hippocampus appears isolated from lateral temporal and other brain structures because the white matter compartment under the floor of the maximally enlarged inferior horn reveals a low SI. Transverse T>-weighted images. The T-weighted images are characterized by homogeneous fronto-orbital and temporal hyperintesities that appear more extensive than the corresponding hypointense area in the T, -weighted mode. The nearly symmetrical hyperintense area comprises the anterior half of the medial aspect of the orbital gyri including the gyrus rectus on both sides. A wedge-shaped extension reaches dorsally in the deep frontal white matter and posteriorly to the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. The Fig. 1 Patient A. A. (A) T>-weighted horizontal sections. (B) T) - weighted coronal sections. Spared mediotemporal structures: gyrus semilunaris, ambiens; amygdala; uncus (arrows) ; parahippocampal gyrus (arrowhead) . For abbreviations, see Table 1. Retrieval of old memories 1381 left frontal pole is more affected than its counterpart of the right. As previously suggested, tissue alteration to the right temporal lobe is restricted largely to the temporopolar region. Correspondingly, the tip of the inferior horn is only slightly widened. With respect to the left temporal lobe, the anterior half seems involved. The medial border of the left-sided hyperintense area is clearly demarcated by the (lateral) outline of the amygdaloid complex and the hippocampal formation. Medial parts of the anterior parahippocampal gyrus may also be spared. The remainder of the brain appears inconspicuous. Summary of MRI findings. The MRI, carried out 18 years post-injury, reveals bilateral frontotemporal tissue damage which can be attributed to the bike/car accident Patient A. A. had suffered in 1974. As indicated by the T, -weighted images, the frontal tissue damage primarily affects the medial portion of lower Brodmann area (BA) 10, and on the left side anterior parts of BA 11 and 12. More extensive gliotic tissue repair, presumably as a consequence of diffuse axonal injury and traumatic oedema, is observed in both frontal lobes involving the frontoorbital and the dorsally adjacent white matter compartment. Gliotic scarring reaches far beyond the rather small lesion area in the fronto-orbital region. With respect to the temporal lesions, it is noteworthy that only the temporopolar region (BA 38) is damaged on both sides. On the left side, anterior lateral and basal structures of the temporal lobe (BA 20, 21, 22, 35, 36) are severely injured except for the amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation and, presumably, parts of the parahippocampal gyrus. The anterior temporal white matter is substantially reduced. The hippocampal formation seems deprived of its neocortical target sites in the convexity cortex, but afferent and efferent fibre connections between the amygdaloid complex and the septal area via the ventral route (amygdalofugal pathway, diagonal band of Broca) should be preserved. Patient B. B. Patient B. B. had 12 years of schooling; he is currently unemployed. After completing high school he joined the army and was stationed in Korea at the time of his injury. His head injury resulted in 3 weeks of unconsciousness and was followed by meningitis and a second operation. Neuroradiological examination MRI revealed extensive frontal and left temporal encephalomacia, affecting a large amount of the prefrontal cortex bilaterally and substantial ventro-anterior portions of the temporal lobes (Fig. 2) . As with Patient A. A. , Patient B. B. s left temporal cortex was damaged along more than its anterior half. The medial temporal cortex was largely spared. 1382 N. E. A. Kroll et al. An EEG from the same time period was interpreted as demonstrating a left temporal lobe focus with possible seizure disorder. MRI was carried out in September 1993 (i. e. 18 years post-injury) using a 0. 5 Tesla scanner. MRI comprised coronal T, ; -weighted (TR 600; TE 20) and transverse T- weighted (TR SE 3000; TE 100) 10-mm sequences. Coronal Tj-weighted images. Sections through the preventricular frontal lobe show extended, bilateral hypointensities involving the frontopolar cortex and the anterior fronto-orbital cortex (including the gyrus rectus and the medial portions of the orbital gyri) . The fronto-orbital white matter compartment below the anterior radiation of the corpus callosum is likewise altered. On the right side, the area of low SI reaches the posterior part of the medial orbital gyri. It is questionable whether the right temporal polar region is affected. If so, there are only spots of decreased SI. The extent of low SI in the left temporal lobe, however, is considerable and measures ~4 5 cm from the pole. It includes the superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri, the anterior and lateral part of the fusiform gyrus, as well as the deep temporal white matter including the temporal isthmus. Despite extensive hypointensities in the left temporal lobe, the corresponding inferior horn seems only slightly enlarged. The left-sided amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation, a major portion of the parahippocampal gyrus and the lateral bank of the collateral sulcus (fusiform gyrus) appear unaltered. Transverse T>-weighted images. The T-weighted images reveal bilateral, completely homogeneous hyperintensities in the frontoorbital white matter. They are sharply demarcated on three sides: (i) laterally by the inferior frontal and anterior insular cortex; (ii) posteriorly by the nucleus accumbens, the anterior putamen and the head of the caudate nucleus; (iii) medially by the frontomedial cortex. The polar and anterior frontolateral cortex, however, is part of the hyperintensive area. The same holds true for the anterior radiation and the genu of the corpus callosum. In more dorsal parts of the frontal white matter, the area of high SI shrinks until, on a section through the body of the caudate nucleus, it is restricted to a wedge-shaped area involving the upper portion of the frontal polar cap, to the gyral stalks of both superior frontal gyri and to that of the second frontal gyrus on the right side. MOG In contrast to the T, -weighted images, there is no doubt that a small area of high SI also affects the right temporal pole, especially its basolateral aspect. The corresponding inferior horn is hardly widened. On the left side, the hyperintensive area, largely coincides with that in the T, - weighted mode. Further evidence is provided that a substantial part of the left parahippocampal gyrus, especially the anterior portion, seems preserved. On the other hand, the left anterior hippocampus may be at least partially altered. The left inferior horn is most likely considerably enlarged. The remainder of the brain appears inconspicuous. Summary of MRI findings. The MRI, carried out 18 years post-injury, reveals extended frontotemporal tissue damage which can be attributed to the blunt head trauma Patient B. B. suffered in 1975. In comparison with Patient A. A. (see above) , the virtually symmetrical frontal lesions are considerably larger, affecting not only the medial and lateral fronto-orbital cortex (anterior BA 11 and 12) and the frontal polar cap (BA 10) , but also the fronto-orbital white matter. As with Patient A. A. , gliotic tissue repair reaches far beyond the true lesion area, involving some parts of the frontolateral cortex (possibly even BA 9/ 64, 46 and 47/12) , a large portion of the deep frontal white Retrieval of old memories 1383 matter compartment, and the anterior radiation/genu of the corpus callosum. Although tissue damage to the left polar (BA 38) , anterior lateral and basal (BA 20, 21, 22 and 36) temporal cortices, and anterior temporal white matter is substantial, the tissue alteration in the right temporal pole (BA 38) appears relatively insignificant. Nevertheless, a bilateral lesion of BA 38 can be assumed. It should be emphasized that the left temporomesial structures (including the amygdaloid complex and the anterior parahippocampal gyrus) are largely spared. However, the left anterior hippocampus may be partially damaged. Patient C. C. Patient C. C. had 10 years of schooling, plus some junior college. He describes himself as self-educated and is currently unemployed (disabled) ; previously he was a car mechanic. He is currently medicated with anti-convulsants. He talks easily, confidently, consistently and realistically about his early life. Neuroradiological examination MRI revealed extensive bilateral frontal damage; however, the temporal lobes were totally unaffected (Fig. 3) . MRI was Fig. 2 Patient B. B. (A) T>-weighted horizontal sections. (B) T, -weighted coronal sections. Spared mediotemporal structures: gyrus semilunaris, ambiens; amygdala; head of the hippocampus (arrows) ; body of the hippocampus; parahippocampal gyrus (arrowhead) . For abbreviations, see Table 1. 1384 N. E. A. Kroll et al. carried out in January 1996 (i. e. 19 years post-injury) using a 0. 5 T scanner. MRI comprised coronal and transverse T, - weighted (TR 500; TE 20) 5-mm sequences. Coronal and transverse T, -weighted images. A section through the optic chiasm demarcates the posterior border of a large tissue area of low signal intensity in the right frontal lobe. The cortical contours of the entire polar cap, the inferior frontal gyrus (with the exception of a small strip of its opercular portion) , the anterior insula and the orbital and frontobasal cortices are no longer discernible. This also holds true for the underlying frontal white matter and for a major portion of the head of the caudate nucleus, the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the anterior putamen/nucleus accumbens. The destruction of the anterior substantia innominata and other sublenticular structures can be assumed. Less marked hypointensities involve the frontodorsal white matter expanding into the gyral stalks of the first and second frontal gyri. A small hypointensive strip, largely restricted to the cortical band, seems to involve the right temporopolar region and the anterior temporal operculum. On the left side, a significantly less hypointense tissue area is primarily focussed on the frontoorbital structures. The cortex of the gyrus rectus, and of the adjacent orbital gyrus, is affected. A hypointense tissue zone reaches from the inferior polar cap through the orbital white matter posteriorly to the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, presumably involving the most anterior parts of the left neostriatum and, in particular, the head of the caudate nucleus. In comparison with an age-matched group of controls, the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles, the frontal interhemispheric fissure and the frontal sulci appear mildly (to moderately) widened. The concavely sunken dorsolateral convexity of the right frontal lobe should be emphasized. The remainder of the brain appears inconspicuous. Summary of MRI findings. The MRI, carried out 19 years post-injury, reveals extended tissue damage in the right frontal lobe due to a, presumably haemorrhagic, contusion and surgical debridement following the patient s motorcycle accident in 1977. Frontopolar, ventrolateral, orbital and basal frontomedial cortices (corresponding with BA 10, 11, 12, 44, 45, 46 and 47) , the anterior insular region and a substantial compartment of the frontal white matter appear largely destroyed. The partial destruction of the right neostriatum and of some sublenticular nuclei, as well as the interruption of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and sublenticular pathways interconnecting the septal region with mediobasal temporal structures, may play an additional role in the lesion pattern. In contrast, the mildly hypointense areas in the frontodorsal white matter, reflecting gliotic tissue repair following regional traumatic oedema or axonal degeneration, may be of minor importance. The lesion of the right anterior temporal operculum appears quite insignificant compared with the much more extended temporal lesions in Patients A. A. and B. B. The left frontal lesion is less substantial regarding both its extent and the degree of tissue damage. It is centred on parts of BA 10 and 11 and the underlying fronto-orbital white matter which, together with the head of the caudate nucleus, may be the only bilaterally damaged brain structures in this patient.

Patient A. A. scored within normal range on all three tests. Patient B. B. had some difficulty with attentional tasks which had a more cognitive load. He was slowed by the verbal interference in the Stroop Test and by the need to maintain dual alternating sequence on Part B of Trail Making, and he was more than a standard deviation below average on the d2-test. However, he was able to complete all three tasks accurately and without undue prompting or redirection. Patient C. C. was quite slow on the Trail Making Task (Part A = 50 s, Part B = 98 s) . Part of his difficulty might be due to his poor eyesight. On the d2- Test, where tunnel-vision is not a handicap, Patient C. C. scored at the 46th percentile. Although Patient C. C. was able to read all 112 words under the time constraints of the Stroop test, he was only able to name 39 of the colours, an extremely low score. Intelligence and conceptual ability Intelligence All three patients were of normal intelligence on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (Patient AA: verbal IQ (VIQ) = 96, performance IQ (PIQ) = 115, full scale IQ (FSIQ) = 102; Patient B. B. : VIQ = 116, PIQ = 89; FSIQ = 104; Patient C. C. : VIQ = 106, PIQ = 94; FSIQ = 100) . Cognitive flexibility/rule generation In the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (original version) , Patient A. A. reached only two categories, Patients B. B. and C. C. six. In the Fibonacci series (see Markowitsch et al. , 1993c) , Patients A. A. and C. C. discovered the rule by the end of the first five number-string. Patient B. B. required three full sequences of five to figure out the rule. In the Category test (long version) (see Lezak, 1995) , Patients A. A. and C. C. behaved normally, Patient B. B. was mildly impaired. Concept comprehension In the Concept Comprehension test (Cronin-Golomb, 1986) , none of the patients had any problems with the concrete concepts. With the abstract concepts Patients A. A. and B. B. made two errors, and Patient C. C. one error (which seemed to be more likely a misinterpretation than a true error) . Application of a Test of Simple Calculations (Markowitsch et al. , 1993c) and a Transformation test (writing out numbers; Tegn r and Nybiack, 1990) resulted in a nearly error-free performances from all three subjects. In the Cognitive Estimate Questions (Shallice and Evans, 1978) , all three made adequate judgments. In the Tower of Hanoi test with four disks, Patient A. A. required 22, Patient B. B. 16, and Patient C. C. 25 moves; our healthy controls averaged 23. 1 moves (minimum number of moves required to solve the problem is 15) . Language Language and word-fluency abilities of the three patients were average on the Boston Naming Test, Sentence Comprehension Test, and Controlled Oral Fluency Test, with the exception of Patient B. B. who scored in the Low Average range of the Boston Naming Test. Skill learning and priming Four tests were used to measure non-declarative memory abilities. In a Mirror Reading Task, subjects attempted to read mirror-images of words as quickly as possible. Words were presented in nine blocks of 40 with blocks two to eight containing 20 new words and 20 words that were repetitions of new words from the previous block. Block nine contained 20 words from block eight and the 20 words from block one that were not repeated in block two. All patients improved over trials in this skill-learning test and appeared quite similar to the control subjects. In an Incomplete Pictures test (Henke et al. , 1993; Kessler et al. , 1993) subjects see a fragmented picture and attempt to name the object represented. Additional pictures are presented, each one more complete than previous one in the series, until the subject reports seeing the correct object. The number of pictures needed before the subject reports the correct object is recorded. The version we used had one practice- and 10 test-objects with seven possible steps for each object. Each subject received three trials (the second trial being 15 min after the first, and the third 5 days later) . All three subjects showed normal perceptual priming performance. Similarly, the normal priming pattern (same modality score > different modality score > baseline score) was found in a Word Fragment Completion test, in which subjects first see or hear a list of 20 eight-letter words (two lists presented visually, two auditorily) and, after each, sees a list of 40 eight-letter word fragments (20 old , 20 new ) . Learning and memory Subjective Memory Questionnaire (Bennett-Levy and Powell, 1980) . Patient A. A. usually rated himself well within the lower half of the normal range. The tester had, however, the impression that Patient A. A. was either being overly hard on himself or tended to overestimate how well other people can do things. Patient B. B. usually rated himself within the upper half, rating himself as being only really bad at remembering telephone numbers. The tester, however, had the impression that Patient B. B. was overestimating his own abilities on at least some measures. For example, Patient B. B. rated himself as average in remembering spatial routes, yet he always had difficulties in finding his way from the testing room, and his sisters reported that he had always had difficulties in learning new routes (note that this difficulty apparently preceded his accident) . Patient C. C. usually rated himself as very good or at least good , with a few exceptions. Wechsler Memory Scale Revised Patient A. A. was in the normal range, only his Delayed Recall Index was borderline (85) . This decline over time was most evident in his memory for the short stories. Patient B. B. was able to learn the new verbal material presented in the short stories for immediate recall with only minor distortion, but the clarity of his memory fell off rapidly with delay. Patient C. C. was in the normal range. Table 3 summarizes the patients results on the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised.

Subjects first received three study test blocks of 12 word pairs (A B) , with mild pre-experimental associations (e. g. lion hunter ) . Then they receive three study test blocks of 12 new word pairs consisting of the same stimuli, but new responses (A-C, e. g. lion circus ) . The results are presented in Table 4 along with those of the prefrontal patients and normal controls tested by Shimamura et al. (1995) . In general, all three patients performed similarly to normal controls, learning the second list quickly with no intrusions from the first list. Verbal learning The California Verbal Learning test entails the learning of categorized lists, each list consisting of 16 words taken from four semantic categories, four words per category. The test involves five presentations and free recall tests with List A, followed by one presentation and a free recall test with List B, followed by free recall and recognition testing with List A. Consecutive recall of words from the same category (semantic clustering) reflects the extent to which an examinee has actively imposed an organization on the list based on semantic features. All three subjects are noticeably impaired in both the recall and recognition portions of this test which requires both semantic organization and list discrimination to do well. The main results for the three patients on the California Verbal Learning test are given in Table 5. Picture recognition In a Picture Recognition test, 10 pictures of male and female faces were presented; after a 3-day delay, these were presented again together with 30 distractors (cf. von Cramon et al. , 1993) . Our controls scored 9. 1 hits and averaged 2. 3 false alarms. Patient A. A. had 9 hits and 2 false alarms. When two of the 30 distractors were presented twice (once early in the test and then again at the end) , Patient A. A. immediately spotted these as within list repetitions . Patient B. B. had only 3 hits, but he had 6 false alarms, and did not respond to the within list repetitions . Patient C. C. had 9 hits and 6 false alarms, and noticed the two within list repetitions . Thus, Patient A. A. had normal hit and false alarm rates, Patient B. B. had both fewer hits and more false alarms than any of our control subjects, and Patient C. C. had a normal 1388 N. E.

All three patients reproduced the Rey Osterrieth Figure normally both under immediate and delayed conditions. Behavioural memory As in the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (Wilson et al. , 1985) , we hid three objects, moving the second object after hiding the third, and asked the subject to remember where they were hidden. All patients recalled all three objects and their locations after 1 h; Patients A. A. and C. C. did so without, and Patient B. B. , with some hesitation. After one week Patient A. A. could describe the task, the objects and their places, Patient B. B. had difficulties recalling them, and Patient C. C. was about intermediate between Patients A. A. and B. B. Semantic retrograde memory Several tests were given to assess semantic retrograde memory abilities: a headlines memory test (kindly provided by A. Shimamura) ; a Time magazine news test; a transient events test; a general knowledge test (kindly provided by K. Schmidtke, see Markowitsch et al. , 1993a) ; and a famous faces test. Headlines memory test This test was updated by us for the time period 1986-1992. It has three forms (A, B and C) , each consisting of 38 Table 6 Performance of the patients in the Headline Memory Test Decade/period 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980-4 1985-9 1990s Questions (n) 18 24 20 25 18 9 AA.

First, a recall test without feedback is given, then later a four-choice recognition test of the same items. Forms B and C are used in later sessions. (Unfortunately, although the test relates to the question of when the event happened, the subject may have learned of it later, e. g. a movie may be re-shown on television, a news show may relate a current event to a previous event. In fact, for some of his answers, Patient A. A. suggested that his memory of these older events was not from the original event itself, but from seeing something related to it recently on TV. ) Table 6 gives the outcome of the Headlines Memory Test for each of our patients and for our healthy controls. Transient events test This test (from M. O Connor, personal communication) includes 40 questions, one per year from 1950 to 1990. Each question is phrased in a way that maximizes the individual s chance of answering correctly. The most salient aspect of an episode is embedded in the question, so, rather than asking for the name of the school teacher who died in the in Table 8, along with the patients answers. The reason for giving this test was to have some indication as to the attention they were paying to current news stories to compare how well they remembered news stories of the past. Their results seem to indicate that they are, if anything, somewhat more aware of current affairs than is the general American public. General knowledge of the world This test included capitals, currencies, automobile brands, famous people and animals (see Markowitsch et al. , 1993a) . Their correct-recall scores were: Patient A. A. >90%, Patient BB. 84%, and Patient C. C. 86%. On recognition tests for the questions incorrectly recalled, Patients A. A. and C. C. recognized the correct answers for all of the remaining items and Patient B. B. recognized the correct answers for all but two of remaining 16%. Famous faces test Pictures from news magazines were obtained from 1936 onwards, and from three contexts: cultural (movie stars, singers, authors, etc. ) ; political (military and political leaders) ; and sports. Two points were given for saying the person s name upon seeing the face. One point if either (i) the person was described in some detail, and/or (ii) the name was supplied after various hints (occupation, first name) . In addition to our 18 healthy control subjects, five control patients were tested, each of whom had_ unilateral hippocampal damage and some indication of anterograde amnesia. Note that the faces from the very early magazines represent a kind of baseline for famous people our subjects would have learned about in school or in later life, while the faces from 1956 onwards represent faces that our subjects should have been seeing in the concurrent news media (Table 9) . Autobiographical retrograde memory The following tests were applied: Old Memories, a Crovitz- form test, Twelve Significant Events, Autobiographical 1390 N. E. A Kroll et al.

As most of them had had at least some college education their averages might be higher than those which would have been found with a group more representative of the social/educational class of our subjects. Both recall and recognition scores are from totals of 10 questions per time period. Thus a recognition score of 5 represents chance performance. Patient A. A. s recognition responses for 1955-74 were accompanied by his saying Guessing or Just saw that on TV . After 1975, he was more likely to say I remember that. Patient C. C. explained his low scores by saying that he had never paid that much attention to current affairs.

In order to have a solid basis for asking Patients A. A. and B. B. about their personal pasts, two of each of their sisters were interviewed, and relevant details from their pasts were recorded in detail. Unfortunately, Patient C. C. did not have family members living in the reachable area. Old Memories Test In the Old Memories Test, there was a huge discrepancy between Patient A. A. s memories from the recent past and those from the time before his brain damage. He had no problems remembering the first meeting with the examiner and details of the testing procedure. On the other hand, he had only very few, isolated memories from his childhood and youth, at least some of which had been told to him after his injury. Of those isolated events he seemed to remember, all seemed to be of a quite emotional nature, e. g. burning his family s house and consequently being spanked with a razor strap by his father, and when he had to move to the front of the class in grade school because his eyesight had deteriorated, and he could no longer see the board from the back of the room (later he suggested that he had been told of the moving to the front of the class incident) . He could neither remember his favourite special toy from his childhood, even after several hints were added, nor a number of his close associates of his youth. He was very concerned about not being able to remember any interactions with one younger sister, though both of his older sisters interviewed told how he used to defend her at school. We asked a number of questions from his personal past, including some related to his previous occupation. He remembered very little and, from those few items he did remember, he was frequently uncertain as to whether he had been told about them after his accident or whether he remembered the actual event. However, it seems that he has some isolated memories from his pre-trauma phase. He termed these items as little bits and pieces that don t really connect with each other. He also had the impression that things from the very recent past seem more likely that they really happened to me . On the other hand, he was able to describe in some detail various tasks that he had performed while in the navy. Two of Patient B. B. s sisters (one older and the other his twin) were interviewed extensively to get an idea about events in the patient s early life. Patient B. B. is not as introspective as Patient A. A. and has a tendency to joke and confabulate in order to give what appear, on the surface, to be answers to questions about his early life. Many of these confabulations are quite obvious. For example, he brags about having been the favourite travelling companion and beer-drinking buddy of his commanding officer while he was stationed in Germany, supposedly because of his command of the German language. When the interviewer started speaking to him in German, Patient B. B. s German proved to be virtually non-existent. Patient B. B. appears to have much more information about his early life than does Patient A. A. , although it is not clear how much may have been re-learned after his injury, but there also appear to be many holes in his memories. Many incidents described by his sisters were not remembered at all by Patient B. B. He did, however, seem to have a good grasp of names of early friends, and names of many of the locations which were significant to his childhood, at least for that period of his life after the age of ten. It was not possible to interview any of Patient C. C. s family members, but he talks quite normally about his early life. His statements made a consistent story and those statements that were possible to verify were reasonably accurate. Crovitz-form test In the Crovitz-form test (cf. O Connor et al. , 1992; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) , 10 high-frequency nouns are administered and the patient is asked to describe personal experiences of a unique episode relating to each word. The instructions were: Relate personally-experienced life events from any time-period evoked by each of the following words. . . and Now estimate the date of this occurrence. The first 10 words constitute the unconstrained condition where the subject is allowed to relate memories from any 1392 N. E. A. Kroll et al. age. The second 10 words constitute the early condition where the subject is asked to relate memories from before the age of 17 years. The final 10 words constitute the middle condition where our subjects were asked to relate memories from between the ages of 20 and 30 years. The whole procedure was repeated 7 days later. Under the unrestrained time condition Patient A. A. produced no memories from the time prior to his injury. When there was a restraint to the time before the age of 17 years, he gave five short answers on five events ( got a car ; there was a tree beside our home ; shot my dad s shotgun ; stepped on nail ; killed my brother s pet pigeon ) . For the time period between the ages of 25 and 35 years, he had even fewer memories. When this whole testing procedure was repeated a second time, he presented exactly the same early memories, but did add a few new details. Under the unrestrained time condition, Patient B. B. produced only one memory from the period prior to his accident, and that had a definite story tone to it. When asked for early memories, the earliest memory he produced was from the age of 10 years. While his early memories were ostensibly the same across sessions, the details were often dramatically different. His unrestrained and middle memory reports tended to be different across sessions. Under the unrestrained time condition, Patient C. C. produced one memory from the age of 4 years, one from the age of 12 years, one from the age of 16 or 17 years , and five recent memories (he claimed to be unable to produce memories for the words happy or successful ) . On the second test, one of the recent memories was replaced by an even more recent memory of something that had happened to him on the way to the testing session. The remaining memories under this condition were basically the same. Under the early condition, Patient C. C. produced nine memories (his response to clumsy was simply: I wasn t clumsy then, not until my accident. ) . In the second session, one of the words produced a different memory. In the middle condition, he produced nine memories, but one was a bit fanciful (involving a rather unlikely fight scene) . The fanciful one was not repeated in the second session. Under all conditions, the details and perspectives changed on some memories from the first to the second session, but these changes were not in conflict. Twelve Significant Events Each subject was asked about 12 biographical events. Patient A. A. s answer to the question What is your first memory? was Needing a shave in the military hospital (immediately after his brain damage) . He did not remember the name of his first grade teacher, nor any toy that he received during childhood. When asked for his first memory, Patient B. B. started telling about an event that occurred to him in Korea. This turned out to be a misunderstanding. He thought he was significant auto- being asked to talk about the first thing that came to mind. When asked to try to remember something from early childhood, he reported a story from fifth grade (when he was ~10 years old) . Of the six questions designed to elicit early childhood memories, Patient B. B. could not answer the two specifically asking for the first two years of school and answered the other four with memories about fifth and sixth grade. When asked for his first memory, Patient C. C. responded being in a tree on a corner in Chicago, ~3. 5 years old, hiding from his older brothers. He was also able to answer questions easily about his first toy, the first time he drove a car, his first girl friend, his first colour TV set, etc. Autobiographical memory interview The autobiographical memory interview of Kopelman et al. (1990) is divided into three sections, Childhood, Early Adult Life and Recent Life, each of which is then subdivided into semantic and autobiographical questions. The section on Recent Life in Kopelman s original version, assumes that the patient s trauma and resulting hospitalization has been recent. Our patients had had their traumas ~20 years previously. Consequently, we modified the autobiographical memory interview to have four sections, Childhood, Early Adult Life, Immediately After Trauma and Recent Life, but kept the general format as similar as possible to the original version. The autobiographical memory interview is probably not measuring memory for Patient A. A. the way it was meant to measure memory. Many of the items, especially many of the episodic memories, were things that he has re-learned since his accident. He was sometimes uncertain as to whether these were original memories or re-learned memories. At other times, he seemed more certain that they were re-learned. Sometimes he switched with the same memory from one meeting to the next, being certain one time that it was an original memory, and equally certain at another time that it was a re-learned memory. Patient B. B. could not relate any incidents about his life prior to fifth grade. His scores for events after this time were quite high, although, as with most of his answers, it was difficult to separate true memories, re-learning and confabulations. Patient C. C. scored very high on the autobiographical memory interview. He lost a few points in childhood by not being able to name three friends before starting school ( I was very lonely then. ) and a few points because he couldn t name his grade-school teachers ( I went to Catholic School; they were all called Sister ! ) , but otherwise got practically every possible point. Table 10 provides a summary of the autobiographical memory interview subscores and Table 11 provides a summary of the principal neuropsychological test results.

B. s autobiographical memories. Patient B. B. has a tendency to confabulate and the autobiographical memories are impossible to check. He was not to be able to remember many of the details of his childhood related by his sisters. Exact score depends on criteria used. Patient A. A. suggested that many of these memories were probably re-learned after his trauma. patients with combined and dominantly left-hemispheric temporopolar and prefrontal damage and in one chronic patient with bi-hemispheric prefrontal damage. The principal finding is that combined temporofrontal damage, but not substantial prefrontal damage alone, results in marked retrograde memory deficits while leaving intelligence and anterograde memory relatively unimpaired. All three patients manifested average values in intelligence and general memory, were able to describe concrete and abstract concepts, to build up strategies, to show normal priming, and to behave normally in several standard learning tasks. In the quite demanding California verbal learning test, however, all three were impaired; none of them seemed to be able to take full advantage of the potential semantic organization in the word list. Their general knowledge of the world was good, but they demonstrated retrograde memory impairments in several other tests. Impairments were obvious in the Headlines Memory Test, the Transient Events Test, and the Famous Faces Test. Although, of course, it is not possible to know if these subjects had much interest in current events when they were young. With respect to retrograde autobiographical memory, Patient A. A. was severely impaired in all four tests applied, Patient B. B. was moderately impaired, and Patient C. C. s memory was intact. These findings confirm and extend previous results from single cases with retrograde memory impairments. First, the brain damage is centred around the inferolateral prefrontal and anterolateral temporal cortices, as had been observed previously (N. Kapur et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993a, b) . Secondly, the patients had a traumatic aetiology for their brain damage, a finding stressed decades ago for cases with retrograde memory disorders (Russell 1935, 1971; Russell and Nathan 1946; Whitty and Zangwill, 1977) . Thirdly, Retrieval of old memories 1393 Patients A. A. and B. B. are able to learn information anew and store that information long-term, a finding again paralleling that of cases L. T. and E. D. of N. Kapur etal. (1992) and Markowitsch et al. (1993a, b) . It has been suggested that whenever the relevant brain damage is predominantly right-sided, episodic old memories are affected, whereas semantic old memories are affected when the damage is predominantly left-sided (Markowitsch, 1995b) . This relationship holds for L. T. and E. D. , as well as De Renzi and Lucchelli s (1993) case, who suffered mainly right-hemispheric damage, and for the cases of De Renzi et al. (1987) and Grossi et al. (1988) , who suffered mainly left-hemispheric damage. Exceptions are the more cursorily described patients (Yoneda et al. , 1992, 1994; Hokkanen et al. , 1995) , who appeared to suffer autobiographical memory loss after left-hemispheric brain damage) . Patients A. A. and B. B. had bilateral damage which may explain their substantial deficits in both the episodic and the knowledge systems. The distinction between episodic and semantic memory may need to be viewed more on a continuum since semantic information may _ include generalized, repeated episodic information (Hodges, 1994) , and generalized (i. e. episodic plus semantic) encoding deficits in brain-damaged patients (Verfaellie and Cermak, 1994) may hold for retrieval as well. The episodic memory system may be more sensitive to brain damage than the knowledge system since episodic information is unique (Damasio, 1990) , while semantic memories may derive from episodic events with generalization and repetition (Hodges, Test Patient AA.

Retrograde amnesia is a multi-faceted phenomenon which can accompany various the gaps with semantic memory and will be re- learning the past through interactions with relatives. The role of the frontal cortex in retrieval Results from studies in patients with selective prefrontal damage usually do not indicate significant retrieval deficits. Only the active, effortful engagement in ecphorizing information may be disturbed (Jetter et al. , 1986; Gershberg and Shimamura, 1995) . Other features of mnemonic information processing which are altered after prefrontal damage include aspects of metamemory and memory for the temporal order of events (Shimamura etal. , 1990) . Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex is viewed as active in the monitoring of environmental stimulation (Shallice, 1982; Knight, 1984) , and in the application of strategies (Shallice and Burgess, 1991) . All of these functions have, however, a closer affinity to the dorsolateral than to the orbitofrontal aspects of the frontal lobes. Damage to the orbitofrontal region is assumed to induce changes in personality and emotional behaviour (Rohrenbach and Markowitsch, 1997) . Subcortically, the mediodorsal thalamus contributes substantially to memory processing, both with respect to encoding and retrieval (Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Markowitsch, 1993a, 1995a) . It is not surprising that a number of reports point to anatomical behavioural interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus and_ the prefrontal cortex. Goldenberg et al. (1991) found a lasting hypometabolism after transient global amnesia which initially had resulted in medial thalamic dysfunction. Related to this, Baron etal. (1994) noted prefrontal hypometabolism in transient global amnesia. Hennerici et al. (1989) , Pepin and Audary-Pepin (1993) and of the temporal lobe. One of his major findings was the appearance of what he called psychical responses , i. e. reproductions of Retrieval of old memories 1395 past personal experiences (Penfield, 1958) ; The subject re- lives a period of the past, although he is still aware of the present (Penfield, 1958, p. 23) . While he attributed these to the (lateral) temporal cortex, Gloor et al. (1982) and Fish et al. (1993) later emphasized that the stimulation of limbic regions was responsible. Halgren et al. (1978, 1985) were also able to elicit numerous responses of this kind in epileptic patients. Furthermore, Halgren et al. (1985) found that the disruption of medial temporal lobe activity for >1 s during recognition also resulted in deficits, suggesting that the stimulated structures might also be engaged in retrieval. (It should, however, be noted that there was only a small delay period between original encoding and retrieving, so that consolidation might not have been completed for these stimuli. ) An additional source for an involvement of the lateral temporal lobes in memory retrieval comes from studies on semantic dementia. Patients with semantic dementia frequently have damage predominantly in these regions and show an inability to retrieve world knowledge information (Hodges et al. , 1992, 1994; Hodges and Patterson, 1995) . Furthermore, there seems to be some indication for a hemispheric asymmetry, with left temporal damage being more closely related to semantic retrograde amnesia and right temporal lobe damage to a retrieval deficit of public figures (cf. also Evans et al. , 1995; Greene and Hodges, 1996) . In summary then, case descriptions of epileptic patients with temporal lobe involvement indicate a role of lateral temporal portions in memory retrieval. Why is there successful retrieval of memories acquired after the temporofrontal damage? As is also demonstrated by Patients A. A. and B. B. , patients with selective temporofrontal damage are still able to acquire new information after the insult and subsequently recall it from long-term memory. This recall must therefore occur via routes independent of the damaged temporofrontal areas. While we do not know the reason for this, speculations on the plasticity of the nervous system which may lead to rewiring or rerouting of information acquired after brain damage appear appropriate (Treadway et al. , 1992) . Another idea, formulated by Squire et al. (1993) , is that the process of consolidation may last for years and may therefore allow a recall via limbic regions over this time period. One might also assume the existence of hierarchically ordered recall systems, similar to the models proposed for memory encoding after damage of relevant bottleneck structures (Markowitsch, 1988) . With respect to the differential retrieval of information acquired after brain damage (but not before brain damage) , the additional requirement is that the process of information consolidation implies the immediate establishment of a retrieval path. In the intact brain this retrieval path would principally and primarily involve the temporofrontal junction areas. In the brain with damage to this region an immediate 1396 N. E. A. Kroll et al. retrieval path would be established to other, intact structures, lower in hierarchy, and less accurate and precise in retrieval. Several authors have proposed the idea, implicitly or explicitly, that the storage of memory content is composed according to landmarks (e. g. around an important event such as the second world war) . This could then result in the inability to recall events which occurred prior to the landmark of the brain damage, while not affecting those stored thereafter (Treadway et al. , 1992; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) . This view might also be in accordance with Wolpaw s (1971) hypothesis that brain damage which is especially traumatic (the dominant aetiology for retrograde amnesia) may disrupt the association between memories due to the missing link (temporofrontal junction area) which is necessary for the organized triggering of (frontal portion) and access to (temporal portion) the engrams. The temporofrontal junction area is composed of the inferolateral prefrontal cortex (portions of BAs 10, 11, 12 and 47) and the temporopolar cortex (BA 38 and possibly immediately adjacent areas) . This region is intimately interconnected via the ventral branch of the uncinate fascicle (Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992) and both the prefrontal and the temporal portion (BA 38) receive afferents from the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus (Markowitsch et al. , 1985) . As our present findings confirm, this region may constitute a unity with respect to its involvement in ecphorizing (Calabrese etal. , 1996) information from the past.

        "other": "1896; Lashley, 1950; Squire, 1987) . It is likely that a number of network-like interacting brain structures subserve mnemonic processing. Indeed, a number of nodal points, or bottleneck structures, for the encoding of mnemonic information into long-term storage have been described. These can be clustered into a medial diencephalic, a medial temporal lobe, and a basal forebrain system (Markowitsch, 1995a) . Information is usually first encoded as an episode, i. e. an event that is specific to time and locus. The resulting episodic old memories are composed of information from our own past to which we can fix a date or a locus which are not necessarily of particular significance (Tulving, 1995) . Disturbances in the recollection of such events occur from many causes, including dementia, transient global amnesia, direct interference (via electrical or chemical means) , thiamine deficiency, focal brain damage or psychogenic amnesia. Oxford University Press 1997 Repetition of information may induce other forms of memory. For example, the knowledge system (frequently referred to as semantic memory ) represents our knowledge of the world, including grammar, calculus, persons of history and geography. Other memory systems represent abilities, e. g. , to drive a car or to play polo ( procedural memory ) , or to be prepared to react on a later occasion to the same stimuli ( priming ) (Tulving, 1995) . An alternative classification includes episodic and semantic memory within a single declarative memory system (Squire, 1987) . There is disagreement over whether patients with anterograde can be just as difficult; people have individual preferences and interests so that, in the absence of pre-tests, their pre-morbid knowledge is largely unknown. (iii) Some autobiographical events may have been transferred into the knowledge system over time and with repetition. (iv) It may be impossible to know the conditions under which knowledge was obtained. Greene and Hodges (1996) gave the example of seeing a politician while on holiday in London and seeing the same politician on the television news. (v) The mode of testing (e. g. recall versus recognition) can influence the outcome (e. g. Chatterjee et al. , 1993; von Cramon etal. 1993) . (vi) In some cases the memory disturbance may be quite selective, for example only affecting the memory of names of people, famous animals, buildings, and product names (Ellis et al. , 1989; Hittmair-Delazer etal. , 1994; N. Kapur etal. , 1994b; Reinkemeier et al. , 1997) . (vii) Finally, there are continued debates on possible gradients in retrograde amnesia (Sanders and Warrington, 1971; Mair etal. , 1979; Butters, 1984; Squire et al. , 1989; Gaffan, 1993) (see below) . Forms of retrograde amnesia Time and content-specific forms of retrograde amnesia have been reported in numerous studies. The reported subdivisions and results depend in part on the patients aetiologies, and in part on the respective nomenclature and fine tuning in the subdivisions applied. Time-specific memory problems have been noted most regularly in temporal sequencing and ordering. These have been reported in patients with basal ganglia Challenger explosion, the subject is provided with the name Christa McAuliffe and asked what the name brings to mind. Two specific facts about each event have been identified as critical for a correct answer. Concerning the Christa McAuliffe example, the individual must mention that she was a school teacher and that she was involved in the shuttle explosion in order to receive a score of 2 on the free-recall portion of the test. If the subject can provide only one key fact, she/he receives a score of 1 . If no correct information is elicited, the score is 0 . If the subject does not obtain a full score of 2 , a pair of recognition questions are administered. These questions are in the forced choice format and are arranged Retrieval of old memories 1389 in a hierarchical fashion so that the first question provides more general information (e. g. Did she die in the Challenger explosion or was she a news anchorwoman who filed a sexual discrimination suit? ) , while the second question focuses on specific details (e. g. Was she an elementary school teacher or a psychologist? ) . Results are given in Table 7 for each of our patients and for O Connor s control subjects. Time news test Time magazine reported the results of a general news test that they had just given people in various countries. The example questions that they reported, and the percentage of the American people knowing the answer, is given : No idea Our added questions (5) | Why was Dan Rostenkowski in the news lately?

Furthermore, the ecphory (triggering stimulus) required by episodic memories may often need a synchronized activation of affect-coding structures of the limbic system (amygdala) (Markowitsch, 1996) . ( Ecphory is used by Tulving, 1983, to describe the process by which retrieval cues interact with stored information during the reconstruction of the information in question. ) The lateral temporopolar-orbitofrontal cortices may not be the locus of the engrams, but appear to be a necessary mediator (Markowitsch, 1995b) . This fact has been stressed for decades. Penfield wrote in 1968 (p. 839) : This should not suggest to us that the engram and its thread of facilitation are localized in the temporal cortex beneath the surgeon s electrode. Indeed it suggests only that there is a scanning mechanism, in the temporal cortex, that is capable of activating the thread of facilitation at a distance. Single unit results from human patients suggest that a large proportion of neurons in the lateral temporal cortex are dedicated to. . . the initial retrieval from memory (Haglund et al. , 1994, p. 1513) . Emphasizing the initial retrieval is in line with our view that the lateral temporal cortex is not the principal storage site of episodic memory, but the one which triggers cortical storage sites to provide memory output. This interpretation seems also to be corroborated by the outcome 1394 N. E. A Kroll et al. Table 11 Overview of the principal neuropsychological testing results in the patients kinds and loci of diseases (e. g. Albert et al. , 1981; Hodges and Gurd, 1994) , and which can occur after damage to quite divergent brain loci (e. g. N. Kapur et al. , 1992; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Markowitsch et al. , 1993a; Ogden, 1993) . Consequently, retrograde amnesia may either be the consequence of widespread cortical damage, as in cases with dementia, where the stored representations or engrams are actually lost (Hodges et al. , 1992) , or in cases with hypoxia-induced widespread cortical dysfunction (Markowitsch et al. , 1997) . Or, as in the present cases, it may (like anterograde amnesia) be a disconnection syndrome which can occur after interruption of major memory processing pathways in the temporofrontal cortex. For this kind of damage then, the engrams may still exist, but access to them is interrupted due to the specific locus of cortical damage (Markowitsch, 1995b) . One of our reviewers asked us to explain, given that this distribution of injury is relatively common, why is isolated retrograde amnesia is so rarely reported. There are probably a number of reasons contributing to this. For example, only modem medicine may enable these patients (with weeks of coma) to survive and still regain their other intellectual and motor-sensory abilities. Another contributing factor could be that doctors may not usually test for it. Retrograde amnesia is a variable phenomenon which may often be mistaken for a confused state, especially as the patient is able to fill in some of Szelies et al. (1991) similarly found prefrontal dysfunction after focal thalamic damage. In conclusion then, the prefrontal cortex contributes to memory retrieval both by providing the impetus or trigger for an active search of the engrams (Markowitsch, 1995b, 1996) and by its capacity as a temporal organizer. As mentioned in the Introduction, autobiographical memory is composed of personally significant knowledge and temporal knowledge (Anderson and Conway, 1993) . The temporal structuring or temporal ordering of information is apparently necessary for its successful ecphory and retrieval. Results from single cases with prefrontal damage strongly support this view (Dall Ora et al. , 1989; Della Sala et al. , 1993) . The role of the temporal cortex in retrieval Descriptions of memory related changes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy provide one major source for the idea that the temporal lobes are memory-sensitive structures. However, as the major cause of temporal lobe epilepsy lies in prolonged febrile seizures in infancy or in birth complications (Penfield, 1975; Miller et al. , 1993) , it can be assumed that the brain of most temporal lobe epileptics has undergone changes from the early postnatal stage onward. Consequently, it is likely that there is a considerable rewiring and functional shift in the brains of such patients. This makes an interpretation of memory-related changes difficult, whether or not there has been a surgical intervention. Nevertheless, we will discuss data from this approach.

        "case_report": "VERBAL MEMORY DETERIORATION AFTER UNILATERAL INFARCT OF THE INTERNAL CAPSULE IN AN ADOLESCENT Hans J. Markowitsch', Detlev Y. von Cramon , Elisabeth Hofmann , Claus-Dieter Sick and Petra Kinzler* (University of Bochum; City Hospital Miinchen-Bogenhausen; *Neurological Rehabilitation Centre for Children and Adults, Gailingen; University of Konstanz) Distinct memory disturbances in patients with otherwise largely intact intel- lectual functions usually result from quite specific brain damage. Structures and fibre systems of the limbic system seem to be most directly involved in the pro- cessing of mnemonic information related to distinct events or facts (Amaral, 1987; Markowitsch and Pritzel, 1985; Mayes, 1988; Mishkin and Appenzeller, 1987; Squire, 1987) . This had led to the speculation that one or several of the stages of memory encoding, storage, or retrieval are mediated via circuits in- terconnecting limbic brain regions and that memory deficits are most severe, global, and long lasting if more than one of those circuits is disrupted (Mish- kin, 1982; Sarter and Markowitsch, 1985; Warrington and Weiskrantz, 1982) . Among the circuits which are currently discussed in this respect are the Pa- pez circuit (Papez, 1937) , interconnecting the hippocampal formation and the mammillary bodies via the fornix, the mammillary bodies with the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract or tractus Vicq d Azyr, and the an- terior thalamus with the cingulate cortex via the thalamocortical radiations and with the hippocampal formation, via the cingulum, or directly with the subi- cular cortex as part of the hippocampal formation via thalamocortical fibres (Irle , 1988) . We herein report a case wherein marked and lasting memory disturbances were observed after an infarct, damaging mainly the genu of the left internal capsule. CASE REPORT Patient A 15 year old, left handed, young man was in good health until an acute collapse during a tennis match. Prior to this event an inflammatory (but probably unrelated) process in the region of the left eye-lids had occured. Neurological examination disclosed a slight hemipa- resis of the right side and a pronounced initial disturbance of consciousness. After improve- ment a minor Broca aphasia was diagnosed. Computer tomography reveaied an infarct in the region of the left internal capsule which extended up to the caudate nucleus and was later confirmed in further CT and MR-tomo- graphy (Wilson et al. , 1988) . A Ti-weighted magnetic resonance tomography (Magnetom, 1. 0 Tesla, SE mode) of the head with horizontal (5 mm thickness, 2 mm distance) , coronal (4 mm thickness, directly bordering each other) , and sagittal images (5 mm thickness, 1 mm distance) , performed four years after his infarct (i. e. , at the age of 19 yrs) , revealed three discrete vascular lesions (Fi- gures la and 1b) . For the description of the anatomy of the anterior perforating arteries see Rosner, Rhoton, Ono and Barry (1984) . (1) A tiny lesion of less than 3 mm diameter in the medio-basal portion of the head of the left caudate nucleus. The vascular microlesion (lacune?) lies most likely within the territory of Hebner s recurring artery. (Coronal section through the head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen; upper left section in Figure 1a) . (2) A triangular pseudocystic lesion centred on the genu of the /eft internal capsule. The brain structures involved were the anterior thalamic peduncle the inferior thalamic peduncle fornix (column) the stria terminalis the anterior commissure the globus pallidus (medial part) . The basal nucleus of Meynert and the diagonal band (bandeletta diagonalis of Broca) were apparently spared. The infarction area was situated within the territory of the anterior perforating arteries. It is highly likely that it belonged to the supply area of the C4 branches of the anterior perforating arteries which arise from the apex of the internal carotid artery. These branches may also supply the most medial segment of the globus pallidus which oth- erwise belongs to the territory of perforating branches of the anterior coroidal artery. (Co- ronal section through the interventricular foramen of Monroi, the infundibulum and the amygdaloid body; lower left scan in Figure 1a) . (3) A pseudocystic lesion within the putamen sparing only the very anterior portion; the cranial extension of that lesion reaches into the body of the caudate nucleus and the adjacent corona radiata. This lesion was due to an infarction of the posterior group of the M1 per- forators (lateral striate arteries) . (Coronal section through the mammillary bodies; upper left scan in Figure 1b) . Verbal memory and unilateral brain damage 599 As a consequence of the considerable tissue loss in the territory of several branches of the anterior perforating arteries the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle was grossly en- larged, its floor lowered. The contour of the left caudate nucelus appears flattened. There was a striking asymmetry of the mammillary bodies with the left one hardly visible. It is no- teworthy that the left anterior temporal horn (of the left lateral ventricle) and the caudal portion of the left insular cistern were also clearly widened. The enlargement of both spaces might be due to the substantial damage to the lenticular nucleus. The enlargement of the in- ferior temporal horn could also be interpreted as an indirect hint to lesions within anterior hippocampal structures although there was no direct evidence available that the anterior choroid artery or hippocampal branches of the posterior cerebral artery were actually in- volved. Amygdala and uncus hippocampi appeared intact. The hippocampal sulcus was not obviously widened. Angiography disclosed the existence of an intracranial occlusion of the left internal car- otid artery. Laboratory chemical investigation (blood culture, virology, mycology, antinu- clear factors, angiotensin 1 converging enzyme, immunology) were negative. Three weeks la- ter an extra-intracranial bypass was performed between the superficial temporal artery and a cortical branch of the medial artery. Three months after the stroke, the patient was transferred to a neurological rehabilita- tion centre. At this time his paresis had largely disappeared and he was able to take long walks (up to 2 kms) . The Babinksi reflex was positive on his right side and there was a postopera- tive peripheral facialis nerve damage. His sensory functions were normal. His aphasic dis- turbance was no longer detectable on the Aachen Aphasia Test. Psychological tests such as Raven s Progressive matrices and a reduced German form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WIP; Dahl, 1986) revealed average intelligence (IQ of about 106 points) . The patient com- plained of (long-term) memory disturbances and word finding problems. From his average performance at high school before the infarct it can be concluded that his IQ had not changed significantly before and after the stroke. Rehabilitation training in mathematics, German language, memory and concentration carried out during the next half year disclosed persis- tent memory problems so that the originally good prognosis, for his successfully finishing high school, formulated by the neurosurgeons, was discarded. Otherwise the patient was normally responsive and socially well adapted; he was concentrated and worked patiently and promptly. Control Subjects Eight healty subjects of average education and intelligence and juvenile age were used as acontrol group. They were used to compare the patient s test results with those of non-brain damaged adolescents. Memory-related Tests Nine months after his stroke, when the patient was still in the Rehabilitation Centre, he was given a battery of tests, some of which were similar to those used in the Rivermead Be- havioural Memory Test battery (Wilson, Cockburn and Baddeley, 1984) . The patient s word finding problems had completely disappeared at the time of testing. Of the total two dozen or so tests and questionnaires we administered, we will describe only those which are of direct relevance to the patient s verbal long-term memory deficits (cf. Table I) . The other tests used were sensitive to perceptuo-spatial functions, flexible adapta- tion, or short term memory, that is to abilities where the patient performed in the normal range. The principal tests employed to study the patient s memory problems can be subdi- vided into four groups: (1) tests of remote (retrograde) memory, (2) tests on remembrance of specific, itemized information (remembering a name, a short route, a message) , (3) tests on learning and remembering words, sentences, or texts, and (4) tests on nonverbal information with a delay component. (1) Tests of remote memory. As tests for old memories (a) a questionnaire and (b) the Crovitz-type remote memory test (Crovitz and Schiffman, 1974; Zola-Morgan, Cohen and 600 HJ. Markowitsch and Others Fig. 1 - T1W coronal magnetic resonance scans (Magnetom, 1. 0 Tesla, SE mode) done 4 years after an infarct in the territory of the left anterior perforating arteries. Figure part A gives the more anteriorly, and figure part B the more posteriorly situated sections; within each part, top left to bottom right is from anterior to posterior. As to the verbal memory impairment the triangular lesion centred on the genu of the left internal cap- sule - second row, left scan - presumably disrupting the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncle, the for- nix (columns) , the stria terminalis, the anterior commissure, and injuring the medial portion of the glo- bus pallidus, seems to be most relevant. Squire, 1983) were used. In the latter test, which originally had been proposed by Galton (1879) , 10 words of a rather general nature (e. g. , flag, bird, window, ticket) are presented and the subject has to associate each word with a specific, personal event of his or her past; the association given should include the time and locus of the event as exactly as possible. In the (a) questionnaire, orientation and remote memory were determined for the period prior to the illness, at the start of rehabilitation and at present, using a 5-point scale (Ben- nett-Levy and Powell, 1980; Herrmann, 1982; McMillan, 1984) . (2) Remembrance of specific, itemized information. The first group of tests was adapted from the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. The subjects were (c) given a portrait and told the first and last name of the shown subject as well as the city he or she lived in (c; re- Verbal memory and unilateral brain damage 601 membrance of a name) ; (d) they were shown a route through the testing room and were told to take an envelope and to deposit it a determined place (d; short route and message) . (3) Learning and remembering of words, sentences, or texts. We used (e) paired-associate learning with 8 pairs of words under classical conditions (e. g. , car - trumpet) and in a mod- ification in which (a different set of) words was embedded in sentences of high imaginative contents ( The car sounds like a [trumpet] ) . A similar version of these two paired-associate task forms had been used previously (Vogel, Markowitsch, Hempel and Hackenberg, 1987) . As a further verbal test, a (/) prose text composed of 23 logical units was given and had to be recalled immediately and after a delay of about one and half hour. Finally for this sec- tion, we used another classical learning task list learning. A list of words was presented and tested in the modification proposed by Buschke and Fuld (1974) under the name (g) se- lective reminding task. In this task a list of 10 words has to be repeated for up to 10 sessions and per session each word which the subject fails to pronounce is repeated ( selectively re- minded ) . All words used belonged to the category animals . With this test, words which are remembered over sessions can be separated from those only mentioned from one session to the next, allowing a separation of short and long term remembered words. 602 HJ, Markowitsch and Others (4) Nonverbal information with delay. The selective reminding task of Buschke and Fuld (1974) was modified by Muramoto (1984) so that instead of words (A) the subject has to re- member the position of 10 small objects located under film cups. The subject receives a set of 10 identical objects and 5 additional ( distracting ) objects and has to locate the objects in front of the cups which he or she assumes the original to lie under (cf. Fig. 1 of Mura- moto, 1984) (h; Muramoto task) . Nonverbal information processing was furthermore tested bu using (i) the tower of Hanoi problem (e. g. , Spitz, Webster and Borys, 1982) under im- mediate conditions (4 sessions) and after a one hour delay (2 sessions) . In our version 4 discs of differing diameters had to be replaced in a number of one-by-one steps in order to build a pyramid again. RESULTS (1) Tests of remote memory In answering the (a) questionnaire on his memory the patient acknowledged great problems in describing the course of the previous day, in learning new things, and in the availability of previously learnt knowledge. Remembering dates, faces, and the location of working instruments were other fields where the patient felt to be significantly below his premorbid level. When asked what he considered to be his most severe difficulty, he answered to think over what had been and happened prior to my injury . The evaluation of a corresponding scaled questionnaire given to the clinic staff was in remarkably high concord- ance with his own answers, indicating that the patient had a realistic estimation of his impairments. The cue-based (b; Crovitz-type) remote memory test also revealed major difficulties. The patient gave only examples from within a narrow time range and made only general statements of his remote experiences. Table I provides a survey of the other results obtained. Generally, this table as well as the following description reveal that the patient had considerable dif- ficulty in all tests in which a delay was interposed between the presentation of the material and its recall. (2) Remembrance of specific, itemized information The patient s memory problems were already apparent at tests of basic, ev- ery-day experience. Thus, he failed to (c) remember a previously induced name and (d) to remember a route and message after delay, while he had been able to follow this route immediately after demonstration. He received 5 points for the route under immediate recall which corresponds to the median value of the con- trol group, but only 1 point under the delay condition where the control group still had 5 points. Similarly, for the message the control group had identical me- dian values under immediate and delayed recall, while the patient deteriorated from 4 to 2 points. (3) Learning and remembering of words, sentences, and texts (e) Paired associate learning revealed a major discrepancy for the two testing conditions as is illustrated in Figure 2. In the unrelated word-word version, the patient was quite poor, while in the context-embedded sentence variant he per- formed at a level quite close to that of the control group, gaining a ceiling value in the last session.

Under the delayed recall condition, on the other hand, he was unable to give any information whatsoever on the story content. The last test given in this section, (g) Buschke s verbal list learning task, again demonstrated the markedly poor verbal long term memory of the patient (Figure 3) . (4) Nonverbal information with delay In comparison to the previously mentioned Buschke version of the selective reminding task, the patient had no major problems with (A) the nonverbal, vis- uo-spatial version of Muramoto. While Table I shows a comparatively low me- dian value for the five test sessions, Figure 3 reveals that he was gaining in per- formance over sessions and was substantially better in this task than in its ver- bal version. In (i) the tower of Hanoi test, the patient had no major problems at the be- ginning (sessions 1 - 4) , though his performance was a little inferior to that of Verbal memory and unilateral brain damage 605 the control subjects (Table I) . After a delay period of about one and a half hours he was unable to do anything with the test, saying that he had no knowledge of what do to with it. Only after re-explaining the rules, was he able to solve the task with 20 moves. DISCUSSION The patient s behaviour, measured nine months after the stroke and there- fore after a substantial recovery period (Skilbeck, Wade, Hewer and Wood, 1983) , appears unusual for several reasons. He was an intelligent and healthy adolescent; his brain injury as far as indicated by repeated CT and MR brain imaging and repeated electroencephalographic recordings was unilateral and circumscribed. The damage, however, resulted not only in the expected symptomatology of transient hemiparesis and speech problems, but also in selective verbal long term memory problems, which were only partly ameliorated by providing various kinds of recall or recognition cues. While there was evidence for mnemonic im- provement over time, when comparing the severity of his memory problems from immediately postoperatively to the time of testing (and with an interview with his mother more than one and a half year after surgery) , his problems were still considerable, especially when taking into account his age, the kind and ex- tent of damage, and his premorbid level of education. The importance of cuing or helping with strategies is evident from the re- sults in paired associate learning under word vs. sentence conditions and from the respectable performance in the sixth session of the tower of Hanoi problem after his failure in the fifth one (after the delay) and the experimenter s repeat- ing of the rules. These results suggest that it is less likely to be the storage ca- pacity of the patient than his encoding and/or retrieval stages that are im- paired. We consider the combined damage of pathways of the Papez circuit and of the basolateral limbic circuit as responsible for his mnestic problems: The trian- gular lesion centred in the genu of the left internal capsule (cf. point 2 of the ev- aluation of the last NMR-tomography) seems to have injured the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncle, probably the fornix column, and the stria termin- alis; as a possible consequence of the likely fornix damage the left mammillary body might be reduced in size. Therefore the information flow within the left hemisphere was interrupted between a number of limbic target structures. Kooistra and Heilman (1988) recently reported data from an old patient with most likely quite similar fibre damage in the left internal capsule and severe ver- bal memory deficits; the authors attributed his deficits to the combined disrup- tion of the ventral amygdalofugal pathways and of fibres between the medio- dorsal thalamus and the prefrontal cortex. While in our case these same fibres were damaged as well, there may have been some additional fibre damage which was not existent in Kooistra and Heilman s case or had not been visible in their CT-scan. On the other hand, it is debatable to what extent, for instance, the un- ilateral fornix involvement might have contributed to the deficit, as fornix le- 606 HJ. Markowitsch and Others sions seem to have quite variable consequences on memory performance (e. g. , Garcia-Bengochea and Friedman, 1987; Grafman et al. , 1987; Tucker et al. , 1988) , depending at least in part on the level of the fornix transection. In this respect the case reported by Grafman et al. (1987) of a 39-year-old soldier with a penetrating brain wound and isolated memory impairment has some resemblance to our case as well. The case had a transection of the col- umns of the fornix (and possibly of the left stria terminalis) with no basal fore- brain or temporal lobe involvement and minimal (ieft dorsoanterior) thalamic damage. As in our case, he had damage within the caudate nucleus, though in their case this was bilateral. His intellectual behaviour was above-average, but with marked verbal long-term memory impairment. Picture, but not semantic, cues helped with encoding in a paired-associate learning task. While Grafman et al. discuss a possible contribution of the caudate involvement in their patient s me- mory deficits (cf. Phillips and Carr, 1987; Richfield, Twyman and Berent, 1987; Stein et al. , 1984) , they favour the role of the fornix cerebri in these deficits, as other cognitive and linguistic skills were intact. In our patient too, we are inclined to discard the relevance of the small un- ilateral damage in the left basal ganglia, as he behaved quite normally in tasks such as the tower of Hanoi problem (without delay between trials; cf. Figure 3) , or the visual-spatial reminding task. Furthermore, a parallel between Grafman et al. s and our case can be drawn with respect to the possible memory mechan- isms impaired. The description of the recall deficit of Grafman et al. s patient as being the likely result of combined postperceptual information-processing deficits in- cluding an abnormally rapid decay of information from working memory when interference immediately follows stimulus presentation and an impaired pro- cessing route that normally allows rapid and efficient encoding, elaboration, and/or recall of verbal-semantic information (p. 1167) , fits the observations made on our patient quite closely. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that in our patient the fornix (and stria terminalis) damage was unilateral and that the damage of the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncle is likely to have made a major contribution to his memory deficit. (The anterior thalamic peduncle bi- directionally connects the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus with the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, and the inferior thalamic peduncle supplies the me- diodorsal nucleus with fibres from orbitofrontal, insular, temporal, and amyg- dala regions) . The anatomical and behavioural results obtained in the present case further stress the relevance of the structures of the Papez circuit and of the basolateral limbic circuit in mnestic processing and what seems more important em- phasize the contribution of the white matter within these systems in this endea- vour (cf. Cramon, 1990; Cramon et al. , 1985, 1986; Markowitsch, 1988) . Posner, Petersen, Fox and Raichle (1988) recently reviewed positron emis- sion tomographic results which indicate that the anterior left frontal lobe is re- lated to the semantic network supporting the type of word associations in- volved in the generate and monitoring tasks (p. 1629) . An impaired thalamic access to this structure may, together with an interrupted access to the moti- Verbal memory and unilateral brain damage 607 vation-flavouring amygdala (Sarter and Markowitsch, 1985) , be regarded as responsible for the observed verbal memory defect. The unilateral damage of the fornix column and of the mammillary bodies may have enhanced this de- fect. Lastly, we wish to comment on the enlargement of the temporal horn: while this might be interpreted as indicative for hippocampal damage and therewith provide further evidence for the enduring verbal memory deterioration, we did not find any (other) indication for hippocampal damage and consequently re- ject such an interpretation, though there is, of course, no final neuroradiolog- ical proof for the nonexistence of a neuronal damage. ABSTRACT After an infarction in the territory of the anterior perforating arteries, a 15-year-old, previously healthy, left-handed patient developed considerable verbal long term memory disturbances which could be followed up and tested for more than nine months. An exten- sive memory test battery was used to determine spared and impaired functions. The patient had remote memory disturbances with respect to personal events for the last 5 years and problems in all verbal task tested which required remembering items over time periods ex- ceeding an hour. The patient was indistinguishable from control subjects on short-term memory tests and on a number of nonverbal learning and recognition tests. The crucial lesion for the observed deficits in the genu of the left internal capsule was assumed to have disrupted the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, fornix (column) , stria terminalis, anterior commissure and the medial part of the globus pallidus. This infarct, therefore, most likely damaged travers- ing fibres which intercommunicate within the Papez circuit and the basolateral limbic circuit and which in part provide access to cortical memory representing areas.

More recently emphasis has been placed on the basolateral limbic circuit, which basically consists of the structures of the or- bitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and their connecting fibre systems (Sarter and Markowitsch, 1985; van Vulpen and Verwer, 1989) . In Livingston and Escobar s (1971) original proposal of this circuit (cf. their Fig. 4) , however, reference is also made to the uncinate fasci- culus, the anterior temporal cortex, the stria terminalis and the ventral amyg- dalofugal pathway. Warrington and Weiskrantz (1982) considered a disconnection of the fron- tal and temporal lobes as likely to result in amnesia and Mishkin (1982) hy- pothetised that amnesia results most likely out of a combined interruption of two pathways, one involving the hippocampus and the anterior thalamic nu- clei, and the other the amygdala and the magnocellular portion of the medi- odorsal nucleus of the thalamus.

D. Henley, MA; Martin N. Rossor, MD, FRCP; Elizabeth K. Warrington, DSc, FRS Background: Encephalitis associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC-Ab) is char- acterized by epilepsy, behavioral changes, and antero- grade memory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals abnormal signal predominantly restricted to the mediotemporal lobes. Objective: To determine the temporal extent and po- tential reversibility of retrograde amnesia in 3 patients with VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis. Design: Case report. Setting: Clinical. Patients: Three patients diagnosed as having VGKC- Ab-associated encephalitis underwent cognitive testing before and after immunotherapy. Main Outcome Measures: [n addition to standard neu- ropsychological tests, retrograde memory was assessed using 2 novel tests. Memory for past newsworthy events was assessed using a public events test; test material was divided into epochs of 5 years and spanned approxi- mately 25 years. This was complemented by a famous faces test in which patients were required to identify individu- als from the recent and remote past. Results: All 3 patients were found to have temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia dating back more than 20 years. Magnetic resonance imaging in all patients re- vealed high-signal abnormalities predominantly affect- ing the hippocampi. Subsequent testing performed after immunotherapy revealed subjective improvement but no evidence of a temporal gradient in the recovery of past memories. Conclusions: Encephalitis associated with VGKC-Ab re- sults in extensive and temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia that is partially reversible with immuno- therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging high-signal abnor- malities were primarily restricted to the hippocampi. These data are supportive of theories postulating a role for the hippocampus in the storage and retrieval of all past memo- ries, irrespective of age, rather than theories of memory consolidation that propose an involvement of the hip- pocampus only in the temporary storage of memories.

Downloaded From: https: //jamanetwork. com/ by a Harvard University User on 11/26/2021 involvement of the hippocampus in this condition. While the hippocampus is universally acknowledged to play a criti- cal role in memory function, the extent of this role re- mains a subject of intense debate, and one of the major is- sues concerns the involvement of the hippocampus in the storage and retrieval of remote memories. This is exem- plified by the conflicting theories of hippocampal func- tion, which differ in terms of the temporal extent of the hippocampal involvement in retrograde memory. Theo- ries of memory consolidation* contend that the hippo- campus acts as a temporary memory store for new memo- ries, while permanent memories are stored instead in the neocortex. Consolidation of memories over time results in a progressive transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex. Hippocampal damage is predicted to re- sult in a temporally graded loss of retrograde memory, with greater loss of more recent, less consolidated memories. Opposing theories propose that the hippocampus is involved in the storage and retrieval of past memories, irrespective of the age of the memory. Warrington and Weiskrantz considered the hippocampus as the point of interaction of episodic and semantic memory systems. Given that memory for contemporary events and recall of remote events requires interaction between the 2 sys- tems, disconnection of the 2 systems resulting from hip- pocampal damage would disrupt retrieval of episodic memories independent of the age of the memories. More recently, Nadel and Moscovitch developed the mul- tiple trace theory, which posits that experiential recall of episodic memories results in the formation of a trace, or pattern, of synaptic activation within the hippocam- pus. Subsequent recall produces multiple traces stored within the hippocampus such that it is always involved in the storage and retrieval of memories regardless of the age of the memories. Accordingly, hippocampal dam- age would also be predicted to result in the loss of re- cent and remote memories in the form of temporally un- graded retrograde amnesia. The issue of retrograde amnesia occurring in the con- text of VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis is explored by analysis of 3 affected patients who were noted to have im- paired retrograde memory in addition to the characteris- tic clinical features of this disorder. Two of these patients (patients KC] and KC2) were included in the review ar- ticle by Vincent et al, and patient KC1 was described ina separate report. * Patient KC3 is 1 of several patients de- scribed in a separate study on spatial memory. PATIENT KCl Patient KC] was a right-handed woodcarver aged 52 years at the onset of his illness. He was initially seen in Janu- ary 2002 with confabulation, generalized seizures, com- plex visual hallucinations, and impairment of episodic memory associated with topographical disorientation. In April 2002, he was transferred to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, England. The initial VGKC-Ab titer was found to be 4005 pmol (ref- erence range, <100 pmol) . Figure 1. T1-weighted image of patient KC1 after treatment. Initial informal questioning revealed that patient KC1 had no memory of past events occurring in his personal life or in the public domain dating back more than 10 years from the onset of his illness. When questioned about news events of the prior 2 decades, he was able only to remember that Princess Diana had died and that there had been a terrorist attack on the Twin Towers but was unable to provide further details. He was treated initially in June 2002 with oral predni- sone. He underwent a course of plasma exchange in Oc- tober 2002 but developed an anaphylactic reaction, and cor- ticosteroid therapy was recommenced. Immunotherapy resulted in a progressive decrease in the VGKC-Ab titer to 453 pmol in September 2002 and to 180 pmol in March 2003. Concurrent with this decrease in antibody titer, there was gradual subjective improvementin his episodic memory. The initial 2002 brain MR imaging revealed high sig- nal within both hippocampi with additional diffuse ce- rebral atrophy and associated enlargement of both lat- eral ventricles. Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated in December 2003 and in June 2004; bilateral hippocam- pal atrophy was noted on the 2003 MR images, and the 2004 MR images did not reveal any change in the de- gree of diffuse cerebral atrophy or in the hippocampal atrophy (Figure 1) . PATIENT KC2 Patient KC2 was a right-handed finance officer aged 43 years at the time of his initial presentation. He was seen in October 2001 with a 1-year history of progressive im- pairment of episodic memory affecting at first his ability to recall details of important work-related events, as well as difficulty in remembering the names and faces of ac- quaintances. Subsequently, he began to get lost in famil- iar places. By early 2002, he started to confabulate, and he became increasingly aggressive and irascible, with oc- casional inappropriate behavior.

Investigations performed at this stage in- cluded brain MR imaging, which revealed abnormal high signal within both hippocampi (Figure 2) . The possibility of retrograde memory impairment was detected during his initial clinical inpatient assess- ment. Patient KC2 made major mistakes when recalling information about the public figures in the famous faces test; he thought that Bill Clinton had resigned from the US presidency following his scandals and that John Major had never been prime minister of England. Among more recent events, patient KC2 thought that George W. Bush had won the 2000 US election with a landslide victory and was unaware of the vote recounts associated with the election victory. The diagnosis of VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis was confirmed in October 2002 with a raised VGKC-Ab titer of 1471 pmol. Patient KC2 underwent a course of plasma exchange followed by oral prednisone therapy. The VGKC-Ab titer decreased to 1058 pmol in March 2003. Figure 2. T1-weighted image of patient KC2 before treatment. This was associated with subjective improvement in his episodic memory. Subsequent brain MR imaging, performed in late 2002, did not reveal any difference in the degree of signal abnor- mality except for additional mild bilateral hippocampal at- rophy. There was no evidence of volume loss in the para- hippocampal gyri or in the other temporal lobe structures. PATIENT KC3 Patient KC3 was a right-handed market trader aged 57 years at the time of initial assessment in 2004. In June 2004, he began to experience panic attacks manifesting as episodes of anxiety associated with a cold clammy sen- sation and an increase in respiratory rate. By August 2004, he began to show memory prob- lems that included difficulty in recalling events during a recent holiday. These new symptoms prompted admis- sion to his local hospital, where initial brain MR imaging demonstrated abnormalities in both temporal lobes (Figure 3A) . In November 2004, he was admitted to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Further ques- tioning revealed that his loss of memory regarding pre- vious events extended back at least 2 years. He was also noted to have marked impairment of memory for famil- iar routes suggestive of a disorder of spatial memory (this is explored further by Hartley et al ) . Results of basic serum investigations were normal except for a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, with sub- sequent osmolality studies confirming a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor- mone. The serum sodium level normalized within 1 week without any associated change in the patient's cog- nitive abilities. A VGKC-Ab titer of 4164 pmol confirmed the diag- nosis of autoimmune encephalitis. Patient KC3 was treated with plasma exchange followed by oral prednisone therapy. The VGKC-Ab titer fell to 799 pmol 2 weeks into treatment with prednisone. The stereotyped panic at- tacks were identified on video electroencephalographic telemetry as simple partial seizures, and his panic at- tacks disappeared within a month of initiation of anti- epileptic medication.

Initial volumetric brain MR imaging revealed abnor- mal high signal restricted to the hippocampi and amyg- dalae bilaterally with no evidence of abnormal signal within the parahippocampal gyri or the remainder of the temporal lobes. Subsequent MR imaging performed 8 weeks after the initial imaging revealed mild volume loss affecting the right hippocampus only, with no other de- tectable abnormalities (Figure 3B) . NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS The results of general neuropsychological testing for all 3 patients are summarized in Table 1. Although some tests, such as the Recognition Memory Test, ' were applied to all 3 patients, there were some differences in other tests applied, reflecting the fact that patients were assessed ini- tially in different hospitals for clinical purposes. Cognitive Abilities The 3 patients had been assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised\"' before treatment or after treat- ment (Table 1) . Except for patient KC1, who was very impaired at his first assessment, scores within the aver- age range were recorded for all 3 patients. Patient KC] was anomic at the first 2 assessments but had improved by the third assessment. There was no evidence of ano- mia in patient KC2 or in patient KC3.

Retrograde Memory Memory for Public Events. The test consisted of 38 ques- tions relating to news events dating back to 1981. Every effort was made to select discrete events equivalent in terms of salience for 5 periods. Seven events were probed for each 5-year period except for 1986 through 1990, for which there were 10 events (Teble 2) . Two points were given for a correct response and 1 point for a partially correct response. Two age-matched control subjects were also tested. Figure 4 shows in graphic form the performance of the 3 patients across the various periods. Patient KC1, who was initially seen with the most severe retrograde amnesia, was found to have virtually no memory for any public event dating back to 1981, and he failed to dem- onstrate any recovery after immunotherapy. In particu- lar, there was no memory of the more remote events. Pa- tient KC2 was shown to have only partial impairment of events occurring within 3 years of his illness but more severe loss of more distant events, thus providing some evidence of a reversal in the pattern of relative vulner- ability of more recent events. After treatment, there was subjective improvement in all periods sampled except for the most remote years (1981-1985) . Patient KC3 was least impaired on this task, but again there was no evidence ofa temporal gradient; although weak by comparison with the control subjects, his performance was similar across all periods. There was some subjective improvement af- ter treatment. Memory for Famous Faces. The ability to identify and name faces of well-known personalities was assessed. The test consisted of 10 contemporary personalities and 10 personalities who were no longer in public view but who had been prominent 5 to 10 years earlier (Table 3) . If the patient was unable to name the personality, he was asked to identify the person by description (eg, John Ma- jor, the previous prime minister of England) .

Subsequent testing of ret- rograde memory function performed after immuno- therapy revealed subjective improvement that varied across individuals. Using public events questionnaire, there was no evidence of improvement on subsequent test- ing of patient KC1, who had the most severe memory loss. After treatment, patient KC2 was able to recall more in- formation relating to all but the most remote periods. By contrast, patient KC3 exhibited improved ability to re- call information from all but the most recent periods. The absence of any temporal gradient to the retrograde memory impairment was also noted on the famous faces test. The test failed to reveal any difference in the ability of the 3 patients to identify famous individuals from the contemporary period and from a period dating 5 to 10 years back from the date of testing. The loss of recent and remote memories documented in this study expands the range of clinical features of VGKC- Ab-associated encephalitis and provides evidence that the memory deficit in this disorder is more extensive than pre- viously acknowledged and incorporates anterograde and retrograde amnesia. As with the loss of anterograde memo- ries, immunotherapy resulted in partial recovery of retro- grade memory function, indicating a degree of reversibil- ity in this acquired cognitive deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging in all 3 patients re- vealed abnormal high signal predominantly affecting the hippocampi. Subsequent imaging revealed resolution of the abnormal high-signal changes and development of mild hippocampal atrophy. These findings are similar to those documented in previous studies** of VGKC-Ab- associated encephalitis in which the initial signal change on MR imaging is noted primarily within the mediotem- poral lobes. Similarly, the evolution of MR imaging changes is consistent with that noted in a serial MR imaging study of limbic encephalitis in which patients with VGKC-Ab were noted to have unilateral or bilat- eral mediotemporal lobe swelling at the time of the ini- tial imaging, with resolution of swelling and hippocam- pal atrophy observed on subsequent imaging. Extensive investigations have been undertaken on the role of voltage-gated potassium channels. Within hip- pocampal neurons, voltage-gated potassium channels have been found to modulate action potential conduction and neurotransmitter release'* and to control dendritic spike initiation and repolarization. * The involvement of the hippocampus in VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis and the probable pathogenic role of VGKC-Ab are rein- orced by the demonstration of heavy immunostaining of the dentate gyrus with antibodies from a patient with limbic encephalitis and a high titer of VGKC-Ab, ! as well as by the documentation of limbic seizures and im- paired learning in potassium channel knockout mice. '*' The subacute impairment of episodic memory in VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis and the evidence for hippocampal involvement are consistent with the rec- ognized role of the hippocampus in anterograde memory function. However, as discussed herein in the introduc- tion, the role of the hippocampus in retrograde memory function remains a matter of debate. In this study, MR imaging revealed abnormalities predominantly affect- ing the hippocampi in all 3 patients with retrograde am- nesia. In patient KC2 and in patient KC3, MR imaging did not reveal any additional abnormalities beyond the mediotemporal lobes; in patient KC1, MR imaging re- vealed a degree of generalized cerebral atrophy, the se- verity of which remained unchanged on subsequent imaging after treatment. Therefore, VGKC-Ab- associated encephalitis with damage primarily affecting the hippocampi is marked by temporally ungraded loss of remote memories. This deficit is partially reversible following immunotherapy, with no evidence of a tem- poral gradient in the recovery of retrograde memories. These findings are in keeping with theories propos- ing that the hippocampus is involved in the storage or retrieval of episodic memories, irrespective of their age, such as the disconnection theory of Warrington and Weiskrantz and the multiple trace theory of Nadel and Moscovitch. Of these 2 possibilities, the recovery of re- mote memories after treatment would support a re- trieval hypothesis and would be difficult to explain in terms of a role for the hippocampus only in the storage of long-term memories. In either instance, the absence of a temporal gradient in the retrograde amnesia is dif- icult to reconcile with theories based on the concept of memory consolidation. Studies that attempt to establish a causal association be- tween hippocampal dysfunction and the occurrence of ret- rograde amnesia are dependent on the selectivity of the ippocampal damage. Historically, studies of retrograde amnesia have tended to investigate patients with hippo- campal damage as part of more extensive brain patho- ogic conditions (as in cases of herpes encephalitis or post- temporal lobectomy) or patients in whom selective ippocampal damage has occurred as a consequence of an- oxic-ischemic brain injury, with attendant disputes about the possibility of hidden pathologic features (ie, other brain regions affected by the anoxic insult but undetectable in vivo by current neuroimaging techniques) . The investi- gation of patients with VGKC-Ab-associated encephali- tis represents a novel approach to assess retrograde am- nesia in the context of hippocampal damage.

Downloaded From: https: //jamanetwork. com/ by a Harvard University User on 11/26/2021 In summary, the demonstration of extensive retro- grade amnesia in 3 patients with VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis expands the range of cognitive deficits iden- tified with this condition. Considered in light of the evi- dence of damage predominantly affecting the hippo- campi, the lack of any temporal gradient in the retrograde memory loss or in the pattern of recovery after immu- notherapy is supportive of the notion that the hippo- campus is critically involved in the storage and retrieval of remote and recent memories. Further studies of the selectivity of hippocampal involvement in VGKC-Ab- associated limbic encephalitis may provide additional in- sights into the neuroanatomical locus of remote memory.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Introduction Obesity is recognized by the World Health Organization as a systemic global epidemic, leading to multiple comorbidities and subsequently increased mortality, morbidity, and health care costs [1]. Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective and safe solution for obesity and its complications. While traditional bariatric proce- dures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [2-7] are associated with malabsorption syndrome and nutritional deficiencies, restrictive procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy are thought to carry a very low risk of such complications. However, nutritional complications are increasingly recognized following such procedures and can be devastating. Thiamine deficiency is a good example as it is consid- ered a rare complication of such surgeries [8-18]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported cases of Korsakoff syndrome following gastric sleeve surgery in a non-alcoholic patient. Case A 36-year-old man with a history of treated hypothyroidism underwent a sleeve gastrectomy procedure for morbid obesity. Preoperatively, he was neurologically and functionally normal, weighing about 140 kg with a BMI of 48 kg/m?. Three months * Corresponding author. E-mail address: AlanoodAsiri@gmail. com (A. A. Asiri) . https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. orcp. 2021. 04. 006 postoperatively, he was brought to our hospital with progres- sive memory impairment and inability to walk for ten days. He noticed numbness, paresthesias, and muscle cramps in his arms and legs. Short-term memory was affected as he could not recall events occurring earlier in the day. He could not provide detailed information about the events happening three weeks prior to the presentation. For the last month, he had severe vomiting and food intolerance, causing reduced oral intake and an inability to toler- ate vitamin supplements. He was seen in another hospital and was given IV fluids. CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable, with no evidence of surgical complications. There has been no alter- ation in the level of consciousness, headache, or fever. He did not have any antecedent infection or vaccination. He does not use illicit drugs and doesn t drink alcohol. His weight on admission was 95 kg (BMI of 33 kg/m2) . He was alert but disoriented to time and place. He had apparent anterograde and retrograde amnesia with impaired registration and short-term recall. He did not exhibit clear confabulation but had no insight into his current condition. Cra- nial nerve examination was normal, including extraocular motility. Motor examination showed muscle weakness on both sides. When graded using the MRC scale, upper extremity arm muscles scored 3-5, worse at deltoids and finger extensors, while lower extrem- ity muscle strength ranged from 2 to5, worse at hip flexors and on the right side. Deep tendon reflexes were obtainable only at the biceps but absent elsewhere. Pinprick perception was reduced in both legs up to the fourth thoracic dermatome.

Systemic examination showed evidence of dehydration without skin, cardiac, respiratory, or abdominal abnormalities. Blood tests, including blood count, PTT, creatinine, electrolytes, TSH, and T4, were normal. He has an elevation of the transaminases, GGT, and direct bilirubin, which eventually normalized a few days later. Copper folate, zinc, and vitamin B12 were normal. He tested negative for ethanol, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Spinal cord MRI with contrast was unremarkable. Brain MRI revealed T2 hyperintensity in the dorsal midbrain involving the colliculi (see Fig. 1) . No restriction was noted on the diffusion- weighted images or blooming artifacts on susceptibly weighted sequences. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced peroneal nerve potentials bilaterally with prolonged distal latency and nor- mal conduction velocities. The other motor potentials, sensory response, F-waves were within normal. Needle EMG showed den- ervation and reduced recruitment in multiple proximal and distal muscles, but no fibrillation potentials were detected. The over- all finding is consistent with a chronic, predominantly axonal polyradiculopathy. There was no evidence of a leak around the surgical site. The picture was consistent with an amnestic syndrome and polyneuropathy that is likely secondary to thiamine deficiency. The typical MRI findings support this. Unfortunately, Thiamine level measurement was not performed due to a lack of reagent in our laboratory. However, empirical IV thiamine (500 mcg every 8 h) was commenced in the emergency room. Due to concerns o autoimmune polyneuropathy, he was also treated with a course of IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) . The cognitive and muscle symp- toms gradually improved, but he had significant residual memory impairment at discharge. Discussion The clinical presentation, along with the MRI findings in this patient, is consistent with the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency, in particular with Wernicke s encephalopathy (WE) progressing into irreversible Korsakoff syndrome. We believe that that thiamine deficiency is a consequence of poor diet and supplement intake in addition to the vomiting that complicated the surgery. In this case, because thiamine levels couldn t be measured, we considered other diagnostic possibilities such as autoimmune encephalitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) , stroke, tumor, and infection. Stroke was considered, but the lack of diffusion restriction made it unlikely. MRI pattern was not suggestive of a tumor (such as tectal glioma) or infection. Autoimmune encephali- tis is unlikely as the patient did not have focal CNS findings, seizures, or T2 changes in the medial temporal lobes or other typi- cal areas, which are required for the diagnosis [19]. NMOSD could present with intractable vomiting. However, lack of enhancement in MRI, subacute time-course, absence of prior relapses, in addition to presentation with amnesia are all unusual for NMOSD. More- over, polyneuropathy, which is a significant problem in this case, can not be explained by this syndrome. The thiamine deficiency will also explain his polyneuropathy. The timing, nerves involved, and progression resembles the patient described by Koike et al. , who reported 17 patients with polyneuropathy caused by Thi- amine deficiency [20]. The possibility of postsurgical autoimmune polyneuropathy was strongly considered given the recent surgery and the non-length-dependent pattern of his neuropathy. How- ever, this entity has always been reported to occur within one month of the surgery [21], unlike this case. Unfortunately, the delay in the diagnosis and lack of awareness by the patient, his family, and other healthcare providers lead to the development of Korsakoff syndrome. Despite receiving high- dose parenteral thiamine supplementation, the improvement was suboptimal, and the patient remained disabled. His devastating condition might have been preventable with adequate vitamin sup- plementation and the active seeking of nutritional deficiencies and neurologic manifestations in his follow-up clinic visits. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential diet-derived vitamin that functions as a coenzyme for normal brain physiology. Neurolog- ical complications following bariatrics surgery, although rare, are usually encountered in the context of lack of postoperative vitamin supplementation [22, 23]. While preoperative thiamine deficiency ranges from 2% to 29% [24, 25], postoperative thiamine deficiency is underrecognized, and thiamine is not routinely checked, especially following a restrictive surgery. Classically, neurological presenta- tions of thiamine deficiency are classified into two syndromes, depending on the timeframe, either acute or chronic. In the acute form, Wernicke s encephalopathy classically presents with the well-known triad of ocular dysfunction, gait ataxia, and mental 294 Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Harvard University from ClinicalKey. com by Elsevier on December 01, 2021.

The chronic form, Korsakoff's syndrome, is described as profound, permanent amnesia that is dispropor- tionate to other cognitive function [27]. About 90% of the causes leading to clinical thiamine deficiency are related to alcohol mis- use. Less common causes include inadequate nutrition, persistent vomiting, hemodialysis, sepsis, malabsorptive gastrointestinal con- ditions, and overwhelming sepsis. To our knowledge, there only a few published cases that resem- ble this case. Gasquoine et al. reported a young female who presented with symptoms of WE fifteen weeks following sleeve gastrectomy. While she received adequate thiamine supplementa- tion after her diagnosis, her residual memory impairment persisted. That patient suffered chronic alcohol use, arguing that she had a superimposed chronic alcohol use-related Korsakoff syndrome that was made worse after the gastric sleeve [28]. Multivari- ate logistic regression analysis in one study showed that higher preoperative BMI, nausea, and vomiting were independent risk fac- tors for the development of thiamine deficiency. Vomiting alone was found to be present in 90% of patients who had developed WE after a restrictive bariatric procedure, similar to this patient [29]. In conclusion, this case highlights many valuable lessons to healthcare providers who take care of patients with obesity. Patients undergoing restrictive bariatric surgeries are not immune from nutritional deficiencies. Physicians and surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion regarding vitamin deficien- cies, especially in high-risk groups such as alcoholics, patients with rapid weight loss, or those who develop hyperemesis and nau- sea. Vomiting post-bariatric procedures is a serious problem. In patients with postoperative vomiting, physicians tend to focus on excluding surgical complications such as leaks or perforation and might not address the symptom itself. First-line providers such as primary care doctors or emergency physicians must be able to recognize the neurological syndrome in any patient who under- went bariatric surgery and rapidly intervenes. Providers should educate their patients and family members about the impor- tance of vitamin supplementation, recognition of symptoms, and the need to seek F, laccarino L, Bugiardini E, Dadone V, De Toni Franceschini L, Colombo C.

A 50-year-old right-handed man devel- oped severe amnesic syndrome and collecting behavior after total removal of a craniopharyngioma. He had very poor results on tests of learning, recall, and recognition for both verbal and nonverbal tasks. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed damage to the bilateral mammillary bodies and fornices, and N- isopropyl-p-[!T]iodoamphetamine single photon emission com- puted tomography showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the bilateral frontal lobes, predominantly in the right, and regions around the third ventricle. The present case suggests that damage to the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle associated with surgery for craniopharyngioma may result in amnesic syndrome and collecting behavior. Generally, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach is the optimum choice for the removal of craniopharyngioma without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, but the risk of neuro- psychologic disturbances must be kept in mind. Key Words: craniopharyngioma, surgical treatment, cognitive sequelae, amnesic syndrome, collecting behavior (Cog Behav Neurol 2007; 20: 126-130) raniopharyngioma is a primary brain tumor arising from the suprasellar region and usually occurs in the first decades of life. Surgical treatment for craniophar- yngioma carries the risk of damage to the memory-related brain structures around the third ventricle, including the thalamus, mammillothalamic tract, and basal forebrain. Neuropsychologic studies in adult patients suggested that surgical treatment could improve the memory and executive dysfunction. ! Memory and frontal function is preserved in most patients except those treated via a pterional approach. * A few studies in children have reported cognitive sequelae after craniopharyngioma surgery.

CASE REPORT A 50-year-old right-handed man with a 12th grade education, a trustworthy city employee, was admitted to a ospital because of headache. Computed tomography demon- strated an intracranial tumor extending from the suprasellar region to the third ventricle, which was removed totally via the rontobasal interhemispheric approach 1 month later. No postoperative radiation therapy was administered. The histolo- gic diagnosis was squamous-papillary type craniopharyngioma. Ventricular drainage was placed via the bilateral anterior horns of the lateral ventricles for 12 days because of postoperative emorrhage in the third ventricle, which arose beside the pituitary stalk and just beneath the optic chiasma, and ydrocephalus. The hydrocephalus caused transient semicoma, ut he was alert and no clinical signs associated with ydrocephalus, such as slowing of mental capacity, frequent alling, and incontinence, were detected despite removal of the drainage. * Panhypopituitarism as a sequela of the surgery was treated with hormone replacement therapy. The patient was soon discharged with marked disorientation, severe amnesia, and confabulation. Confabulation disappeared about 1 year ater. However, he was admitted to our hospital because of persistent and unchanging amnesia and behavioral problems including hyperphagia and affective incontinence, which pre- vented his reinstatement for 2 years. On admission, the patient was alert and cooperative, but demonstrated marked amnesia and collecting behavior. He forgot having eaten immediately after meals, and insisted that he had not had food. Confabulation was no longer present. He brought back toilet paper each time he visited the toilets, and collected the paper in his locker. Physical and neurologic examinations revealed no abnormalities except for bitemporal hemianopsia. The results of routine laboratory tests were within the normal ranges. Pituitary hormone levels were well controlled by replacement therapy. Detailed neuropsychologic examina- tions were performed during the following month.

Language His spontaneous speech was fluent, and neither dysprosody nor paraphasia were detected. Auditory comprehension, repetition, confrontation naming, read- ing, and writing were all intact. His aphasia quotient was 98 by the Western Aphasia Battery (Japanese edition) . Frontal Function Frontal executive function was slightly defective, as shown by the following findings: 5 categories achieved on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, slightly longer time on the Trail Making Test Part A and Part B than the norms, 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Amnesic Syndrome After Craniopharyngioma 56. 4 seconds and 110. 2 seconds, respectively, and verbal fluency for animals of 11 words. Memory The patient had severe anterograde amnesia with preserved retrograde and procedural memory as follows. The Wechsler Memory Scale Revised showed general memory index was 54, verbal memory index 64, visual memory index 50, delayed recall index <50, and attention/concentration index 105. Recognition memory test for both faces and words did not exceed the chance level. Retrograde amnesia was examined using the autobiographical memory interview (AMI) , which showed that incidents recalled were 9/9, 9/9, and 1/9, and personal semantic memory was 21/21, 19. 5/21, and 8/21 for childhood, early adult life, and recent life, respectively. His recall was impaired only for recent life. * However, there is almost no doubt that retrograde memory was preserved, because the recent life questions in the AMI consist of almost premorbid episodes, and additionally he sometimes recalled a traffic accident which had occurred 2 months before the surgery. Procedural memory was examined with the Tower of Hanoi test, which revealed normal procedural learning, although he had no recall of the task. Confabulations were never observed in either spontaneous speech or the confabula- tion battery. ? Others Praxis and calculation were intact. No construc- tional disorder or unilateral spatial neglect was noted. NEUROIMAGING Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a cystic structure of residual craniopharyngioma in the third ventricle, which compressed the body of the fornix (dashed arrow) and reduced its thickness, and presumably induced the dilation of the anterior horns of the bilateral lateral ventricles (Figs. 1A, D) . However, this structure had not enlarged after surgery. The bilateral crus of the fornix were thinned and partially destroyed on the left (dashed arrow) (Fig. 1B) . Cystic change was detected in the right mammillary body and atrophy in the left (arrow) (Fig. 1B) . No abnormal areas were detected in the thalamic structures, the medial temporal lobe, or the basal forebrain except for a small infarct in the right thalamic polar artery territory (Figs. 1C, D) . N-isopropyl- p-[']]iodoamphetamine single photon emission com- puted tomography (SPECT) showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the bilateral frontal lobes, predominantly in the right, and regions around the third ventricle (Figs. 2A-C) . DISCUSSION Our patient showed amnesic syndrome character- ized by marked anterograde amnesia and collecting behavior after total removal of a craniopharyn- gioma. However, he had no retrograde amnesia and confabulation. Unfortunately, we have no premorbid 127 Tizuka et al neuropsychologic data, but he did not show any signs of amnesia, and could perform his work without problems before surgery, so we believe that his cognitive and behavioral impairments developed immediately after the surgical operation. MR imaging revealed no atrophy of the hippocampus, amygdala, or entorhinal cortex, and SPECT showed no reduction of cerebral metabolism in the temporoparietal association cortices and the posterior cingulate cortex, which are both well-established findings in patients with Alzheimer disease. MR_ imaging also showed no atrophy or abnormal intensity in the hippocampal formation, which are characteristics of mesial temporal sclerosis. ! '? These findings indicate that his symptoms were not induced by any degenerative disease. Surgical approaches to the removal of craniopha- ryngioma depend on the location of the tumor. Intrasellar tumors located in the subdiaphragmatic portion can be treated via a transsphenoidal approach. However, this procedure is less suitable for pituitary adenoma, because of the strong adhesion between the craniopharyngioma capsule and the pituitary stalk or the diaphragma, or FIGURE 1. Sagittal (A) and coronal (B) T1-weighted, and axial (C) and coronal (D) T2-wighted brain MR images. MR images showed a cystic structure of residual craniopharyngioma in the third ventricle, which compressed the body of the fornix (dashed arrow) and reduced its thickness, and presumably induced the dilation of the anterior horns of the bilateral lateral ventricles (A, D) . However, this structure had not enlarged after surgery. The bilateral crus of the fornix were thinned and partially destroyed on the disturbance owing to infarction of perforating vessels. '>!> MR imaging revealed a right anterior thalamic lesion in our patient, which was probably owing to occlusion of the thalamic polar artery caused by the surgery. Right anterior thalamus infarction of the polar artery territory is characterized by anterograde visuospatial amnesia without retrograde amnesia, anomia, low verbal fluency, and frontal lobe dysfunction including impairment of executive function, abulia, and depression. Although these findings partially accord with the symptoms of our patient, functional recovery of the polar artery occlusion is generally good except for amnesia and abulia. ' Therefore, the thalamic small lesion was not solely responsible for his symptoms. The amnesia in our patient may have involved effects on the basal forebrain that was adjacent to the surgical approach. However, our patient never learned any of the features of his attending physician, whom he met every day for a month. No cues stimulated recall or recognition. Therefore, damage to the basal forebrain was unlikely to account for his amnesia. ! Our patient had damage to the fornix and mammillary bodies. Localized damage of these structures in or adjacent to the hypothalamus may cause amnesia. Damage to the unilateral or bilateral fornices can result in severe anterograde amnesia with less impairment of retrograde amnesia and recognition, indicating that the retrieval process of memory is preserved in amnesia induced by fornix injury, which is not exactly similar to our patient. '*? At the same time, whether damage to the mammillary body can cause amnesia has been contro- versial. There is a previous case of marked anterograde amnesia without retrograde amnesia caused by cranio- pharyngioma, but the presence or absence of recognition memory impairment was not described. ?! Another case of marked verbal memory impairment included recognition memory that followed a penetrating bilateral mammillary bodies injury caused by a snooker cue, which entered 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Cog Behav Neurol * Volume 20, Number 2, June 2007 FIGURE 2. N-isopropyl-p-['231] iodoamphetamine SPECT scans of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on the anterior surface (A) , inferior surface (B) , and axial slice (C) at the level of the third ventricle. The SPECT data were collected in 64 x 64 matrices, and were reconstructed in sections parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane with 8-mm thickness. Z-score maps were produced with the easy Z- score Imaging System (Daiichi Radioisotope Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) using SPM99 (The Wellcome Department of Neurology, London, UK) to implement anatomic standardiza- tion and smoothing algorithms. On the basis of rCBF images of 20 healthy subjects, normative mean and SD images were constructed. The voxel value of the patient was converted to a Z score [Z = (individual value mean in the healthy subjects) / SD in the healthy subjects]. A Z-score map showing voxels exceeding the threshold of Z score >1. 7 (1-tailed P<0. 05) was plotted on the standardized anatomic space. The regions of decreased rCBF included the bilateral frontal lobes, especially in the right, and regions around the third ventricle. Right column indicates the color bar of Z score. L indicates left side. hrough the left nostril. 2? The retrograde amnesia was very mild, and nonverbal memory was relatively pre- served. 2? We suppose that this apparent difference in severity between verbal and nonverbal amnesia results rom the laterality of damage in the mammillary bodies. The patient also had significantly increased appetite, just ike our patient, which suggested damage to the hese reasons, we think that the amnesia of our patient was mainly induced by damage to the bilateral mammil- ary bodies, and possibly also by the damage to the our patient differed from the memory deficits in children hat is characterized by good performance on recognition asks. > Apparently, the difference may be related to the damaged area. In contrast with the MR imaging findings, SPECT revealed hypoperfusion of the thalamus surrounding the he third ventricle and the hypofunction of the medial halamic nucleus including the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) . The MD has strong reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex. In particular, the medial part of the MD is linked with the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices. This lesion is likely to induce apathy, abulia, and 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Amnesic Syndrome After Craniopharyngioma disinhibition, resulting in failure to inhibit inappropriate behaviors. ?? Lesions associated with collecting behavior are located in the mesial frontal region including the right polar sector and the anterior cingulate cortices. *4* Though collecting behavior caused by MD lesion has not been reported, such a remote effect is presumably caused by the hypoperfusion in the right mesial and dorsal prefrontal regions, which may be involved in the development of collecting behavior, as well as the mild executive ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. *!: ?* For all of bilateral fornices. Interestingly, the amnesia pattern of hird ventricle. This finding reflects both the dilation of dysfunction in our patient. The frontal dysfunction is unlikely to result entirely from the operation procedure. Therefore, damage to the structures surrounding the third ventricle caused by the craniopharyngioma and the surgica procedure were probably jointly responsible for the amnesic syndrome and frontal dysfunction in our patient. Craniopharyn- gioma surgery and third ventricle tumor surgery both carry the risk of memory deficits. 77> The present case suggests that damage to the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle associated with surgery for craniophar- yngioma may result in amnesic syndrome and collecting behavior. Generally, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach is the optimum choice for the removal of craniopharyngioma without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, but the risk of neuropsychologic disturbances must be kept in mind. .

This approach allows access to the third ventricle through the lamina terminalis to remove craniopharyngioma tissue from the lower and anterior third ventricle, as well as through the opticocarotid triangle and the prechias- matic space. Tumors extending from the sellar and suprasellar region to the third or lateral ventricle with the risk of iatrogenic damage to the optic pathway and the hypothalamus can be treated via a frontobasal interhemispheric approach. The basal interhemispheric approach combined with translamina terminalis provides a good view of the structures of infundibulohypophyseal axis, and tends not to require strong retraction of the frontal lobes. Furthermore, the arteries and veins cour- sing along the exposed dorsal and medial surfaces of the frontal lobe and over the corpus callosum can be preserved, in contrast to the pterional approach. Gen- erally, the basal interhemispheric approach is a valid choice for the removal of craniopharyngioma without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, and is rarely associated with transient mild memory with 168 patients.

Snyder', Sheliza Ali?*, Joanna Sue**, Ayse Unsal?*, Crystal Fong? and Zhi ui Deng? Abstract bilateral thalamic and rostral midbrain infarction. and rehabilitation concerns that may be overlooked. Background: The artery of Percheron is an uncommon anatomic variant which supplies the bilateral paramedian thalami and rostral midbrain. While infarction of its vascular territory can result in a wide range of symptoms, paramedian thalamic syndrome is classically described as a triad of symptoms including vertical gaze disturbances, fluctuating level of consciousness, and amnesia. There is minimal evidence to date to characterize the long-term cognitive consequences of infarction of the artery of Percheron utilizing neuropsychological assessment. Case presentation: We describe a 40-year-old female patient initially presenting with dizziness, confusion and falls with unremarkable head CT scans. Subsequent MRI, more than 24h after symptom onset, identified evidence of leuropsychological testing was administered at 4 months post- stroke, with follow up testing at 1 year. The patient was found to have profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, which did not change significantly over the first year of rehabilitation, and which was not easily identifiable in everyday encounters due to her relatively intact working memory and social skills. Conclusions: As early diagnosis of infarction of the artery of Percheron is challenging, patients have frequently missed the time window for acute management of ischemic stroke. Moreover, this case study highlights the need for further research in deciphering the role of the paramedian thalamus in memory and cognition, as well as the importance of standardized neuropsychological testing for the artery of Percheron stroke patients to identify safety Keywords: Artery of Percheron, Paramedian thalamus, Neuropsychological assessment, Anterograde and retrograde amnesia Background The artery of Percheron (AOP) is an uncommon ana- tomic variant first described by G rard Percheron in 1973. It refers to a single arterial trunk originating from one of the proximal posterior cerebral arteries to supply bilateral paramedian thalami and rostral midbrain [1]. The AOP is thought to occur in up to 33% of the * Correspondence: dengz22@mcmaster. ca ?Regional Rehabilitation Centre, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Canada Division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the article BMC population, with a majority of individuals having inde- pendent hemispheric vascularization of these structures (2]. Infarction of this artery is often characterized by a triad of symptoms including altered level of conscious- ness, memory deficits, and supranuclear and _ vertical gaze palsies [3]. Rarer clinical presentations have been described, including patients presenting with severe bradycardia, parkinsonism and convulsive seizures [4 6]. Infarction within the vascular territory of the AOP is an important differential diagnosis to consider in an indi- vidual presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with fluctuating level of consciousness (LOC) , especially The Author are still an area of controversy [1, 8]. The paramedian region is postulated to contribute to arousal, memory, personality and behavior based on vari- ous case reports describing sequelae such as reduced level of alertness, amnesia, apathy, and disinhibited behavior following bilateral infarction of this territory [3, 8]. Thus, neuropsychological assessment is an important compo- nent of initial testing of individuals with AOP infarction to determine degree of deficit in various cognitive do- mains. To our knowledge, only one case study of AOP in- farction with neuropsychological assessment at two timepoints exists, and it describes a dramatic improve- ment of behaviour and cognition from 3 months to 1 year post-stroke [9]. Here, we present a case of a patient who similarly suffered bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction, but with a profoundly different outcome of severe amnes- tic syndrome and other cognitive deficits as identified by neuropsychological testing at 4 months and 1 year. Case presentation Our patient was a 40-year-old right-handed woman with a previous history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) , reportedly related to oral contraceptive use and not managed medically. Otherwise, her past medical his- tory was unremarkable for stroke risk factors. She awoke one morning complaining of dizziness and shortly there- after began to act strangely, including missing a step while walking and getting into a low-impact collision while driving her son to work. She was alert and speak- ing clearly following this event, and her son suggested that she walk the short distance home. A couple of hours later, the patient was dysarthric and confused. She was subsequently found with evidence of trauma likely due to falls, including contusions on her feet, shin, and face for which she was not able to provide a history. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was documented to be between 8 and 10 by Emergency Medical Services. Upon arrival at the ED, our patient s GCS deteriorated to 6 (motor 4, eyes 1, verbal 1) and she was temporarily intubated. Neurological exam was significant for subtle anisocoria with right pupil dilation, but both pupils were equally reactive to light and there was no gaze deviation. Initial medical workup including lumbar puncture and electroencephalography was unremarkable. CT head with- out contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. Page 2 of 6 A repeat CT head with angiogram performed the same day were also unremarkable. Finally, a brain MRI with angiogram the following day demonstrated evidence of acute infarcts in the bilateral thalami and midbrain (Fig. 1) with angiographic findings suggestive of occlusion of the right artery of Percheron (Fig. 2) . Unfortunately, our pa- tient was past the time window for thrombolysis. She was managed conservatively and then admitted to a local re- habilitation centre for post-stroke rehabilitation once medically stable. Investigations for stroke etiology, includ- ing coagulopathy screen, ultrasound for DVT, and trans- thoracic echocardiogram with contrast bubble study for intracardiac shunting, were unremarkable. A thorough vasculitis workup was not performed given the lack of evi- dence of brain angiitis on imaging or clinical signs of a systemic rheumatologic disease. She was ultimately transferred to an Acquired Brain In- jury (ABI) Rehabilitation Program 59 days following her initial presentation. Her admitting neurological examin- ation revealed slightly reduced left-sided strength in both her upper and lower extremity without other focal neuro- logical deficits. Meanwhile, significant cognitive impair- ment was identified, specifically involving her memory and executive functioning. Regarding functional status, she was using a wheelchair regularly for safety and cogni- tive reasons but was physically able to perform transfers and climb stairs with supervision, she was alert but not oriented, she was occasionally incontinent of urine, and she displayed lack of judgement and some impulsiveness. A trial of neurostimulants (amantadine up to 100 mg BID and methylphenidate up to 15 mg BID) aimed at improv- ing her cognition did not lead to any functional benefit. As an inpatient on the ABI unit, our patient under- went several days of standardized neuropsychological as- sessment at four months following her initial event. A battery of tests was administered over several sessions, which assessed her intellectual functioning, processing speed, attention, working memory, visuospatial function, memory, and executive functioning. She was noted to have a profound memory deficit, with performance in the lowest percentile on nearly all tests of immediate re- call, delayed recall, and recognition (i. e. she was unable to recall or recognize either verbal or visual information after delays of approximately 20 to 30min) . While she tended to perform in the low average to average range on tests of working memory, she could not encode these memories into long-term storage. Moreover, consistent with a severe anterograde and retrograde amnesic syn- drome, she self-reported an inability to form any new episodic memories or recall any events which occurred before her stroke, including the inability to recall mem- ories of her childhood. While she also performed poorly on tests of executive function, it was difficult to deter- mine the true extent of these deficits as her ability to Snyder et al.

Importantly, her relatively intact basic attention, working memory, and social skills made it extremely difficult for those around her to determine the extent of her memory im- pairments. At 1 year follow-up, the patient s neuro- psychological assessment showed mild improvement in her visual memory functioning, but her other memory scores remained weak and consistent with her previous assessment (Table 1) . Prior recommendations including 24-h supervision, repetition of information, provision of one-step instructions, and gradually increasing physical and mental activity were still being employed by her family with good tolerance of these strategies. Discussion and conclusions AOP infarction is an often-delayed diagnosis due to vari- ous factors. First, the AOP is an uncommon anatomic variant and its stroke syndrome is not commonly en- countered. Next, ischemia of this region can present in a variety of ways and is not limited to the classically de- scribed paramedian thalamic syndrome [3]. Finally, MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis of AOP infarction, while CT is routinely used as first-line imaging for standard stroke diagnosis [7]. In our case, MRI was per- formed more than 24h after the patient s initial symptom onset that identified restricted diffusion within the thalami and midbrain bilaterally. The early recogni- tion of thalamic stroke syndromes as a cause of de- creased LOC and coma is essential since hyperacute AOP infarction can be treated effectively with intraven- ous heparin and thrombolysis [10, 11]. This case emphasizes the need for neuropsychological as- sessments at various time points following AOP infarction to identify the true extent of cognitive impairment. While there have been cases where AOP infarction led to an amnestic presentation similar to Korsakoff syndrome with its pathog- nomonic symptom of confabulation, our patient s profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia was not immediately obvious to caregivers due to her strong social skills and rela- tively intact working memory [12]. The extent of her deficit was only identified when she completed neuropsychological testing, which also allowed for appropriate care recommen- dations and prognosis to be delivered. Although our patient did not show significant recov- ery, Krolak-Salmon et al. described a case of AOP infarc- tion with memory impairment 1 month post-stroke, but complete recovery after 1 year [9]. While recovery trajec- tory has not been specifically analyzed in this population, a major study of anterior circulation ischemic strokes showed that functional outcome was best predicted by neurologic improvement at only 2 days post-infarction Snyder et al. BMC Neurology (2020) 20: 370 Page 4 of 6 Fig. 2 Angiographic findings suggestive of occlusion of right artery of Percheron. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (a) and CT angiogram (c) demonstrated normal opacification and diameter of the vertebrobasilar arterial trunk, excluding top of the basilar artery syndrome. There was slight asymmetry of the posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) with relative narrowing of the right P1 segment compared to the left (yellow arrows in a and ) , raising the possibility of incomplete P1 occlusion or stenosis and occlusion at the level of the perforating branches of the right PCA, namely artery of Percheron. However, the filling of the more distal part of the right PCA appeared normal, likely due to the contribution from a robust posterior communicating artery (yellow arrows in b) . Magnetic resonance venogram (d) demonstrated normal opacification and filling of the internal cerebral veins (yellow arrows) and intracranial venous sinuses, excluding deep cerebral venous infarct 13]. Accordingly, our patient s outcome may be more representative of the typical stroke patients. Regarding memory impairment, researchers have noted that patients with damage to the dorsomedial and intrala- minar thalamic nuclei, which are impacted by AOP infarc- tion, may present with similar memory difficulties as those with bilateral hippocampal damage [14]. On the other hand, prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction is associ- ated with executive function impairments [15] and some researchers have proposed that the memory deficits seen in AOP stroke are secondary to impairments in executive function, supported by the correlation between thalamic substructures and PFC [16]. Increasing evidence indicates interconnections between the PFC and the dorsomedial thalamus, although the mechanism of PFC-thalamic func- tional connectivity underlying higher cognitive function is not completely understood [17]. While there may be a re- lationship between our patient s executive function and memory, given the severity of her memory deficits (i. e. , anterograde and retrograde amnesic syndrome) , it is un- likely that her executive abilities would fully account for all aspects of her memory impairment, such as her inabil- ity to form basic episodic memories. Limitations of the current study include differences be- tween administration of neuropsychological assessment at 4 months and 1 year after stroke. Particularly, the initial assessment was completed over several days, whereas follow-up was obtained in 1 day and included self-report measures of behaviour and personality as opposed to ex- tensive clinical interviewing. Although testing was com- pleted in different settings (inpatient versus outpatient) and there was some variation in the measures utilized, both were conducted by licensed neuropsychologists and similarly trained psychometrists. Future studies may take a more experimental approach by having a standard as- sessment protocol at each timepoint. In closing, AOP infarction is an important differential diagnosis to consider when a patient presents with fluctu- ating consciousness characteristic of stroke but initial head CT is normal, since early diagnosis and management may significantly improve clinical outcome. We described a case of a 40-year-old female presenting with profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia who missed the time window for thrombolysis following AOP occlusion. Neuropsychological assessment at 4 months and 1 year post-stroke showed limited improvement over time. Snyder et al.

Performances that span across ranges represent variability within that domain. Simple visuospatial functioning and inhibition were tested at the 4 month timepoint only. Importantly, her relatively intact social skills and working memory prevented appreciation of the true extent of her memory deficit in the absence of neuropsychological test- ing. Thus, this case study emphasizes the need for thor- ough neuropsychological testing to document areas of impairment and to identify strategies for rehabilitation and safety in AOP stroke patients. It also supports the role of the paramedian thalamic territory in executive function and memory as has been described by previous works, but additional research is needed to decipher the functions of specific thalamic nuclei, such as the dorsomedial nucleus, in moderating these cognitive domains.

(From the Division of Behavioral Neurology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Neurology, and the ?Department of Anatomy, University of lowa College of Medicine, lowa City, lowa, USA) SUMMARY The anatomical basis and cognitive profile of diencephalic amnesia remain unclear. We report a two-part study. First, we studied 4 patients with bilateral medial thalamic infarctions using magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. All patients were followed for more than 1 year. Using a stereotactic method, we plotted the lesions in an atlas delineating the probable structure involved. Secondly, in 2 monkeys, using autoradiography, we traced the pathway from the amygdala to the dorsomedial nucleus, paying particular attention to the intrathalamic course of the amygdalothalamic projections. Our findings were (1) patients develop amnesia when infarctions are located anteriorly; (2) in patients with amnesia, the lesions can be small and strategically located, probably interfering with both hippocampal- related neural structures such as the mamillothalamic tract, and amygdala-related neural structures such as the ventroamygdalofugal pathway; and (3) a specific component of the latter is situated lateral but immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract in the monkey, enabling both structures to be damaged bilaterally by small mirror image lesions. The amnesia is characterized by deficits in anterograde verbal and visual learning and in retrograde amnesia, but motor learning is preserved. We raise the possibility that bilateral diencephalic lesions may interfere particularly patients with bilateral thalamic infarcts, all in the interpeduncular profundus arterial territory. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and comprehensive neuropsychological testing in the chronic stage. Using a technique first described by Archer et al. , (1981) and validated in a postmortem study by Graff-Radford et al. (1985a) , we localized the lesions anatomically. We then attempted to relate the patients performance on memory tests to the location of the lesions. Secondly, because it was important to know as accurately as possible the course of the amygdalothalamic projections, we traced this pathway in the nonhuman primate. These monkeys received tritiated amino acid injections in the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, and the pathway from the amygdala to the dorsomedial nucleus was studied using autoradiography. Of special interest was the intrathalamic course of this pathway relative to the mamillothalamic tract, that is, could both these pathways be damaged by small strategically located mirror image lesions? Another important issue is the pattern of amnesia in patients with diencephalic infarcts. It has clearly been established that patients with medial thalamic infarcts may develop an anterograde verbal and visual amnesia (Winocur et al. , 1984; Graff-Radford et al. , 1985b; von Cramon et al. , 1985; Rousseaux et al. , 1986; Gentilini et al. , 1987) . What is little explored is the pattern of retrograde amnesia and these patients performance on motor learning tasks. In this paper we will attempt to address these issues and discuss the implications of our findings in relation to the possible role of the diencephalon in memory. CASE REPORTS Case | A 68-yr-old right-handed retired teacher was in excellent health until June 20, 1982 when she was suddenly found to be confused. She was admitted to hospital obtunded and remained somnolent for the first 10 days.

There was a past history of borderline diabetes, but no history of hypertension or smoking. Examination revealed a supranuclear vertical gaze paresis. A CT scan 10 days after admission showed bilateral enhancing medial thalamic infarctions. The patient was discharged and lived in her own home with permanent live-in help because of a significant memory impairment. The family noted a personality change in that she was less inhibited. Over the next 5 yrs she was seen several times in the neurology clinic and underwent neuropsychological testing. Her memory deficits remained stable. On September 25, 1987 she underwent MRI which confirmed the bilateral thalamic infarcts and no other lesions (fig. 1) . She also had neuropsychological testing which revealed a stable pattern of amnesia. Case 2 A 19-yr-old left-handed woman had the sudden onset of confusion in April 1986 and was admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals. She had no previous illness but was on contraceptive pills. She was intermittently drowsy, had right emotional facial weakness, mild drift of the right arm, and normal sensation LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO Jesn AyeIGIT JooYDS Me pseneH Aq ZL LOSE/L/L/E L L/elolue/uleiq/woo' dno-olwepece//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq 4 N.

She remained confused and drowsy for the first week in hospita!, CT showed bilateral medial thalamic infarctions. Echocardiography and arteriography were normal. MRI in October 1986 revealed bilateral thalamic infarcts without other lesions (fig. 2) . Over the next year she underwent neuropsychological evaluation three times, the last time in July 1987. Since her stroke her family have noticed that she is socially uninhibited and laughs inappropriately. Examination in July 1987 showed full eye movements, a decreased right nasolabial fold, and decreased swing of the right arm while walking. The patient s family noted that she had to be reminded many times to complete certain tasks. Case 3 At the end of January 1987 a 57-yr-old right-handed farmer was found by his wife to be snoring and was difficult to arouse. For 2 h she tried to wake him and then called the ambulance. He awoke briefly some hours later in hospital but became somnolent again and remained so for several days. Two weeks later he was transferred to the University of lowa Hospitals. There was no history of hypertension, diabetes, LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO Jesn AyeIGIT JooYDS Me pseneH Aq ZL LOSE/L/L/E L L/elolue/uleiq/woo' dno-olwepece//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 5 Fic. 3.

Except for increased somnolence neurological examination was normal. MRI revealed bilateral medial thalamic infarctions (fig. 3) . Echocardiography showed an atrial myxoma. Cerebral angiography was normal. The patient underwent cardiac surgery and the atrial myxoma was successfully removed. He was seen in the neurology clinic in May and October 1987 and March 1988, and underwent neuropsychological evaluation and a repeat MRI of the head. The patient has returned to farming and he and his family deny any memory deficit. Case 4 A 56-yr-old right-handed factory worker had a sudden onset of unresponsiveness, lasting 2h, on February 5, 1987. He was taken to the local hospital, regained consciousness, and no focal neurological deficits were found. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or cardiac disease. There was a past history of bladder cancer resected in 1980 without recurrence. CT, EEG, ECG and cerebral angiography were normal. MRI showed a small left occipital and bilateral thalamic infarctions (fig. 4) . On referral to the neurology clinic at the University of Iowa on March 4, 1987 he was found to have down and upbeat LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO JasN AyeIgI] jooyDS meq pPeMeH Aq JL LOGE/L/L/EL L/elome/ulesq/woo dno-olwepecey/: sdyy Woy papeojumoq 6 N.

Repeat MRI was performed in May 1987. The patient has returned to his usual activities and he and his family note no memory deficit. METHODS Neuroradiological study All 4 patients underwent MRI in the chronic stage of the disease, coincident with neuropsychological testing. The scanner was a Picker International Superconducter with an 0. 5 Tesla magnet. Images were obtained in sagittal, axial and coronal planes using both Ti and T2 weighted imaging methods.

Archer et al. (1981) originally described this method using CT and we confirmed its accuracy in a postmortem study (Graff-Radford et al. , 1985a) . The method is based on the Schaltenbrand and Wahren Atlas (1977) and the rationale is to find the 3-dimensional location of the lesion in relation to the anteroposterior commissure line (AP line) , i. e. , how far is the lesion (1) ahead of or behind the commissures; (2) above or below the AP line; and (3) lateral to the midline.

Neuropsychological study The first 3 patients were tested in the first month after onset and all 4 patients were tested in the chronic stage. In the chronic stage Case 1 was tested several times, finally 6 yrs after the stroke; Case 2 more than 1 yr after her stroke; Case 3 6 and 12 months after his stroke; and Case 4 3 and 12 months poststroke. The neuropsychological examination probed the following: orientation, intellect, speech and language, visuospatial and visuoperceptual processing, executive control , and memory. With regard to memory, the following functions were tested: anterograde verbal, anterograde visual, retrograde memory and motor learning. A complete list of the neuropsychological tests is given in Tables | and 2. RESULTS Neuroradiological study Axial and coronal slices showing the lesions, together with the centre of these slices drawn on the midsagittal view, are shown in figs | 4. Fig. Sa (left side) and B (right side) show the results of plotting the lesions on the sagittal sections in the Atlas 5. 15 mm from the centre of the third ventricle (Plate 39 in the Schaltenbrand and Wahren Atlas) . The lesions in Cases 1 and 2 are situated more anteriorly and involve the mamillothalamic tract, and the pathway from the inferior thalamic peduncle to the dorsomedial nucleus. The latter is true on both sides for Case | and on the left for Case 2. Case 2 also has involvement of the anterior nuclei bilaterally. In Case 3 there are large lesions affecting mainly the dorsomedial nuclei bilaterally. Case 4 has small bilateral lesions in the lower part of the dorsomedial nuclei. In both Cases 3 and 4 the mamillothalamic tract is spared. Cases 1 3 involve the midline nuclei bilaterally.

The lesion in Case / is small but strategically located, probably damaging the mamillothalamic tract (Tm. th) and interrupting fibres from the inferior thalamic peduncle (Pd thif) . In Case 2 the lesion also damaged the mamillothalamic tract. In addition, the anterior nuclei are damaged. Fibres from the inferior thalamic peduncle are probably only partly interrupted as they head for the superior part of the dorsomedial nuclei. The anterior part of the dorsomedial nuclei is damaged. In Case 3 the dorsomedial nuclei are damaged bilaterally but the mamillothalamic tract is preserved. The lesions in Case 4 may have partially interrupted fibres coming from the inferior thalamic peduncle but the mamillothalamic tract probably was spared.

In passing through the ventral anterior nucleus they assume a position immediately lateral to the mamillothalamic tract. Neuropsychological study Table 3 presents the overall results of the neuropsychological tests and Tables 4 and 5 give the detailed scores of the memory testing. Figs 7 and 8 show the results on the remote memory tests and motor learning tests, respectively. None of the patients had a significant global decline in intellectual functioning or was aphasic, and in all patients visuospatial abilities were normal in the chronic stage. (The IQ scores for Case 2 were in the borderline range, but were considered to be normal given the patient s educational and occupational background. ) In all patients executive control function (as measured by the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) was mildly to moderately impaired. In addition, by family report and clinical observation, all patients demonstrated personality changes, characterized primarily by disinhibition and lack of motivation. Tables 4 and 5 show that Cases 1 and 2 have severe anterograde verbal and visual memory deficits; Cases 3 and 4 have milder deficits evident only on delayed tasks. Case Fic. 6.

She is also defective on both the Warrington recognition tests. Case 2 scored normally on the recognition component of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. She also scored normally on the Warrington Recognition Memory Test for words and faces. In contrast, Cases 3 and 4 at the chronic stage scored in the normal range on all the verbal and visual memory tests except for those requiring delayed recall. The latter are the most difficult types of memory task, indicating that these 2 patients have a milder memory deficit than Cases 1 and 2. An exception to this general pattern is that Case 3 is defective on the Warrington Face Recognition Test. All patients showed good motor learning (fig. 8) . Fig. 7 shows the scores on the remote memory test, 7A showing scores on the Boston Famous Faces test for spontaneous recall and 7B the scores using semantic and first name cues. Fig. 7c shows the results in recognition of recent events for Albert s test. Fig 7p and E show recall and recognition scores on Squire s test of famous events. All patients, but especially Case 1, benefited from cues on the Boston Famous Faces test and in the recognition format on the Squire s test. Only on this latter test on the recognition format does Case 1 show a temporal gradient scoring better in the 1950s compared with the 1980s. These scores require qualification by the description of the performance of Case 1 on some of the tests as well as an analysis of 2 taped interviews, one in 1982 and another in 1988 and her answers in a written questionnaire about events in her personal biography. First, on the recognition of famous faces it is noteworthy that the patient frequently was able to give the correct last name when given cues including the person s first name (fig. 7A, B) . She also accurately identified by name all members of her family when shown pictures of them. Secondly, in the interviews and biographical questionnaire the patient gave accurate information about her personal life, such as her date of birth, names of her schools LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO JasN AyeIgI] jooyDS meq pPeMeH Aq JL LOGE/L/L/EL L/elome/ulesq/woo dno-olwepecey/: sdyy Woy papeojumoq 14 N.

When the interviewer said, No, it s later than that she then replied Oh, Ronald Reagan . When asked what her daughter did, she said that her daughter was the head nurse in Orthopaedics in a specific hospital (which she named) in Des Moines. The examiner pointed out that it was after that and the daughter had moved. The patient then gave the correct name of the current hospital in California to which her daughter had moved. When asked to name her grandchildren, she named the first 4 and when prompted that there may be another, she named the youngest. Another important point is that she gave no indication of learning about new events since her stroke. For example, she could not recall undergoing a colonoscopy even when the examiner tried to prompt her about this. Case 2 was too young for the standardized remote memory tests to be of significance, LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO JasN AyeIgI] jooyDS meq pPeMeH Aq JL LOGE/L/L/EL L/elome/ulesq/woo dno-olwepecey/: sdyy Woy papeojumoq 16 N. R. GRAFF-RADFORD AND OTHERS but she performed well on a personal history questionnaire. Cases 3 and 4 performed normally on the remote memory tests and the personal history questionnaire. In summary, Case | has a severe anterograde visual and verbal memory loss. Case 2 is also impaired but less so than Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 are only mildly impaired and not at all disabled by the deficits demonstrated in the laboratory. Motor learning was preserved in all patients. Remote memory loss was present in Case 1 as seen on spontaneous recall, probably normal in Case 2 (in view of her recall of biographical data) , and normal in Cases 3 and 4. These findings on formal memory testing are in keeping with the observations of how the patients functioned in society after their stroke. Case 1 was completely disabled, Case 2 needed some supervision, and Cases 3 and 4 resumed their previous activities without any supervision. DISCUSSION Our findings support the notion that a significant anterograde amnesia resulted when there was damage to diencephalic neural systems related closely to both the hippocampus and amygdala, specifically the mamillothalamic tract and ventroamygdalofugal pathway to the dorsomedial nucleus (as in Case 1) and the mamillothalamic tract, anterior nuclei, anterior part of the dorsomedial nuclei, and superior part of the ventroamygdalofugal pathway (Case 2) . (Note that the preservation of the ventral part of the ventroamygdalofugal pathway and most of the dorsomedial nuclei might account for this patient s better performance than that of Case 1. ) When only one of these systems was damaged, a milder, clinically insignificant memory loss occurred (as in Cases 3 and 4) . The role of damage to the midline nuclei or their medial temporal connections cannot be determined. The second part of our study showed that the hippocampal and amygdala pathways are adjacent to each other anteriorly in the thalamus of the monkey (fig. 6c) . Our plottings of the infarcts revealed that the lesions causing amnesia were also anteriorly located and involved the region where these pathways course adjacent to each other. In contrast, the lesions that did not cause a clinically significant amnesia were situated more posteriorly in the thalamus. It should be noted that the size of the infarct did not necessarily influence the occurrence of amnesia. Case 1 had the second smallest infarct and had the worst amnesia, whereas Case 3 had the second largest infarct and had a subclinical memory deficit. Furthermore, lesions involving dorsomedial nuclei alone did not cause a clinically significant amnesia. CT findings in reported cases of infarction-related diencephalic amnesia Von Cramon et al. (1985) summarized the CT findings of 11 diencephalon infarcts reported to cause amnesia; 6 were their own cases and 5 were from the literature. They noted that anteriorly located lesions cause amnesia, whereas posterior lesions do not, and concluded that the internal medullary lamina and the mamillothalamic tract were the critical sites of the lesions causing amnesia. Since then there have been several reports. LZ0Z 49q0}99 6Z UO JasN AyeIgI] jooyDS meq pPeMeH Aq JL LOGE/L/L/EL L/elome/ulesq/woo dno-olwepecey/: sdyy Woy papeojumoq DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 17 Gentilini et al. (1987) evaluated 8 cases with bilateral medial thalamic infarcts. All had acute CT scans between 4 days and 3 months, making it difficult to distinguish oedema from the chronic lesion. Case 5 could not be tested and Case 6 was an alcoholic. Case 2 had no acute verbal amnesia and the left-sided lesion was located posteriorly. Cases 4 and 8 recovered from their acute amnesia by 3 months; again the lesions were posterior. Case 1 had a documented amnesia at 3 months. The right lesion is clearly anterior but we are uncertain about the lesion on the left. Case 3 remained chronically amnestic according to the family and the lesions are probably anterior. Case 7 remained amnestic for several months in hospital; again the lesions are anterior. In essence it seems from the study that anteriorly located lesions are necessary for chronic amnesia. With posterior lesions, amnesia does not occur or the patients recover from it. This is in keeping with the authors conclusion that the damage to the mamillothalamic tracts, anteriorly located structures, is related to the amnesia. Mori et al. (1986) reported a case of left thalamic infarction and amnesia. Again the lesion was situated anteriorly and involved the mamillothalamic tract. Rousseaux et al. (1986) reported 5 cases of medial thalamic infarcts, 3 bilateral and 2 unilateral. They concluded that anterior medial thalamic lesions are more likely to cause amnesia than posterior lesions. Kritchevsky et al. (1987) reported 1 mainly left-sided and 1 right- sided thalamic infarct without chronic amnesia. The lesions were in the dorsomedial nucleus and did not involve the mamillothalamic tract, that is, they were posteriorly situated. There are 2 relevant postmortem studies. Castaigne et al. (1981) reported the postmortem findings of 28 cases with paramedian thalamic infarction. Cases 2, 5, 7, and 13 had chronic amnesia and Cases 2, 5, and 7 had neuropsychological testing documenting this. Cases 5 and 7 had additional posterior cerebral territory infarctions which might have contributed to the memory deficit by involving the medial temporal area. The infarcts in Cases 2 and 13 involved the mamillothalamic tract (on the left in 2 and bilateral in 13) . Again this suggested that anterior thalamic lesions are associated with amnesia. Bogousslavsky et al. (1986) reported a haemorrhagic thalamic infarct which did not involve the mamillothalamic tract and caused amnesia acutely. Because the amnesia was only noted acutely and the infarction was haemorrhagic, it is possible that there were pressure effects on anterior structures contributing to the deficits. In summary, there are numerous reports of chronic amnesia from thalamic infarcts and the lesions are situated anteriorly. There are also several reports of thalamic infarcts without amnesia and the lesions are situated posteriorly. This is in keeping with the 4 patients we report here. Primate studies formation, whereas damage to the dorsomedial nucleus or its connections is likely to impair neural systems related more intimately with the amygdala. At present, it is uncertain which system or systems that damage to the midline will affect. Dense amnesia following lesions of the diencephalon and its connections Lastly, we will summarize the occurrence of a dense amnesia in anatomically well documented lesions of the diencephalon and its connections, either in isolation or in combination. We will do this for man and monkey. Table 7 summarizes these findings. We should admit at the outset that whether there is a dense amnesia or not is a judgement we have made on the available data which is deficient in many instances; the patients with isolated fornix (Woolsey and Nelson, 1975) , anterior thalamic (Mark et al. , 1970) and mamillary body lesions (Victor et al. , 1971) , for example, had no formal neuropsychological testing but were all felt not to be amnestic. It would surprise us if on formal testing some deficit in memory functioning could not be documented in such cases. This is why we have used the term dense amnesia which we believe would be clinically obvious to the patients families and their doctors. Furthermore, the monkeys with isolated lesions often showed mild impairment on memory tests compared with controls, but again these deficits were significantly less severe than monkeys with combined lesions. Mair et al. (1979) and Mayes et al. (1988) carefully studied patients with Korsakoff s syndrome in the postmortem studies of the two groups of Korsakoff s patients quoted above, damage to midline nuclei and mamillary bodies may be sufficient to cause amnesia. Again hippocampal and amygdala pathways could be involved. In summary, patients and monkeys with isolated damage to one of the nuclei in the thalamus, or one of the medial temporal connections to these nuclei, are usually reported not to have a dense amnesia. In contrast, combined lesions invariably cause significant amnesia. The diencephalon and memory Thus from an anatomical point of view, we can conclude that (1) lesions located anteriorly in the thalamus are more likely to cause amnesia; (2) our tracing the ventroamygdalofugal pathway to the dorsomedial nucleus in the monkey showed that this pathway is lateral and adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract; (3) the lesions causing amnesia in our patients are likely to have interfered with pathways to the diencephalon both from the hippocampal formation (mamillothalamic tract) and amygdala (ventroamygdalofugal pathway) . In contrast, in the 2 patients without significant amnesia the mamillothalamic tract was spared. All these observations support the idea that simultaneous damage to diencephalic nuclei and/or their connections related both to the hippocampal and amygdala is likely to result in a dense amnesia. Other structures, however, such as hypothalamus, basal forebrain and medial frontal area have strong connections both to the medial temporal area and the thalamus and it is possible that pathways from these structures to the thalamus may also have been LZ0z 49q0}99 6Z UO Jasn AyeIgI jooyDS meq pseneH Aq JLLOGE/L/L/EL L/eloque/ulesq/wioodno-olwepede//: sdyyy wo papeo|umoq 20 N. R. GRAFF-RADFORD AND OTHERS damaged by the infarctions and contributed to the amnestic state. In view of the experimental evidence in the monkey that damage to the ventroamygdalofugal pathway (at a site less likely to interfere with the above-mentioned pathways) and the fornix is sufficient to cause amnesia (Bachevalier et al. , 1985b) , it is likely that interference in these two pathways by the lesions in our patients is also probably sufficient to cause amnesia without invoking damage to other pathways as mentioned above. If it is true that damage both to amygdala and hippocampal systems in the diencephalon is necessary to cause a dense amnesia, it implies a certain parallel redundancy of the memory system which allows at least partial compensation when only one of the anatomical systems is damaged. This has been proposed by Mishkin (1982) and the findings in this paper are in keeping with this argument. There is, however, some contradictory evidence. Patient R. B. of Zola-Morgan et al. (1986) who had anoxic damage only in the hippocampal formation, had a clinically disabling amnesia. His memory did show mild improvement with time. In contrast, H. M. , who probably has damage both to the hippocampus and amygdala bilaterally, had worse amnesia than R. B. (Zola- Morgan et al. , 1986) and has not improved with time. With regard to the diencephalon, the evidence to date is that damage to the diencephalic-related hippocampal structures alone (fornix: Woolsey and Nelson, 1975; Moss et al. , 1981; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1985; Bachevalier et al. , 1985a; mamillary bodies: Victor et al. , 1971; and anterior nuclei: Mark et al. , 1970) does not necessarily cause a disabling amnesia. However, as pointed out earlier, the studies in man lack good neuropsychological measures of the amnesia and thus further studies in this area will be of great importance to clarify what at this time seem to be contradictory data. The pattern of amnesia in our patients shows, as has that in others, that damage to the diencephalon may cause a marked anterograde verbal and visual amnesia. This is one of the first demonstrations of preserved motor learning in amnestic patients with thalamic infarctions (Nichelli et a/. , 1988) . Case 1 had a temporal gradient (worse in the 1980s, better in the 1950s) on the Squire test of Recognition of Famous Events. This pattern differs from that described by Sanders and Warrington (1971) in a group of amnestics of mixed aetiology but is similar to several studies on patients with Korsakoff s syndrome (Squire et al. , 1975; Albert et al. , 1979) . Winocur et al. (1984) studied retrograde memory in a patient with bilateral thalamic infarction and did not find the temporal gradient as seen in our Case |. Thus because this pattern is seen in only | patient in our study and on only | test, and because of the contradictory available data, we do not believe any strong conclusion can yet be drawn from this finding. There is some evidence from our observations in Case 1 and in the literature that the diencephalon may play a role in temporal orientation and the temporal sequencing of events. The first patient s memory was greatly improved when the examiner told her where in time she was; for example, as mentioned above, during an interview in 1982 she claimed Lyndon Johnson was President and when the examiner said it was Jater than that, she correctly named Ronald Reagan as President. In 1956, Spiegel et al. reported that patients undergoing dorsomedial thalamotomy LZ0z 49q0}99 6Z UO Jasn AyeIgI jooyDS meq pseneH Aq JLLOGE/L/L/EL L/eloque/ulesq/wioodno-olwepede//: sdyyy wo papeo|umoq DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 21 often suffered from chronotaraxis , i. e. , disorientation for time. This occurred in 19 of 30 cases, 4 additional patients were disorientated for time and place, and 7 were not disorientated. In most instances the disorientation was short-lived. The transient nature of most of these cases makes it likely that other stuctures are also important in temporal orientation. In fact, we have observed that damage in the basal forebrain may result in disorientation-sensitive amnesia. For example, one of our patients (Damasio et al. , 1985) , after sustaining damage in the basal forebrain from a ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm, during an interview several weeks after this haemorrhage denied being married. When orientated to this he correctly recalled a flood of information including his wife and children s names and their ages. Experiments in Korsakoff s syndrome also support the notion that the diencephalon may be important in using time as a clue to remembering. Huppert and Piercy (1976) showed that patients with Korsakoff s syndrome are markedly impaired when required to make explicit judgements of temporal context . These patients had greater difficulty identifying if they had seen pictures 10 min or | day before, than if they had seen the pictures at all. In another experiment, Squire (1982) came to a similar conclusion regarding Korsakoff s patients which he wrote were disproportionally impaired in the ability to make judgements about the temporal order of recent events . He felt the deficit might be specific to the Korsakoff s patients because the same problem was not detected in a diencephalic amnestic (Case N. A. ) and ECT patients who may have temporal lobe dysfunction after ECT. An alternative possibility is that Case N. A. , who has an asymmetric diencephalic lesion may be better able to sequence events than Korsakoff s patients, who usually have bilateral lesions. Thus this finding of impaired judgement of temporal order may apply to diencephalic amnestics with bilateral lesions including Korsakoff s syndrome. This remains to be confirmed in future studies. Squire argued that this deficit was possibly related to frontal damage in Korsakoff s patients. All our patients had lesions which could compromise dorsomedial nucleus connections with the frontal lobe, which is in keeping with Squire s notion. Parkin and Leng (1988) also argued that Korsakoff s patients are particularly poor at making temporal discriminations. This was based on the performance of a group of Korsakoff s patients performances on a learning task requiring recency judgements. In conclusion, we have found that patients with bilateral medial thalamic infarcts in the interpeduncular profundus territory develop chronic amnesia when the lesions are anteriorly situated. This is in keeping with several other studies. These lesions can be small and strategically located to interfere both with the hippocampal-related neural systems such as the mamillothalamic tract and amygdala-related neural systems such as the ventroamygdalofugal pathway. A specific component of the latter that connects the amygdala to the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus is situated lateral but immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract in the monkey. On review of the animal and human data of anatomically well described lesions affecting the diencephalon and its connections, together with the data from this study, we believe that, as in the temporal lobe, damage to diencephalic nuclei and/or their connections related both to the amygdala and hippocampus is more likely to cause a dense amnesia. We raise the possibility that the LZ0z 49q0}99 6Z UO Jasn AyeIgI jooyDS meq pseneH Aq JLLOGE/L/L/EL L/eloque/ulesq/wioodno-olwepede//: sdyyy wo papeo|umoq 22 N. R.

        "other": "with temporal aspects of memory. INTRODUCTION The clearest examples of chronic anterograde amnesia in animal and man occur with lesions in either the medial temporal area (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Corkin, 1984) or the diencephalon (Victor et al. , 1971) . For the medial temporal lobe, the evidence in the monkey indicates that amnesia is worse when both the hippocampal formation or its connections and the amygdala or its connections are damaged (Mishkin, 1982) . Since the hippocampal formation and the amygdala have powerful connections with the diencephalon, an important question is, are the diencephalic nuclei and/or the connections of both these medial temporal structures affected when amnesia occurs with diencephalic damage? While this has been suggested (Aggleton and Mishkin, 19835) , the answer remains unclear for many reasons. (1) The diencephalon contains many nuclei and projections in a compact space so that lesions in this area that cause amnesia often damage several nuclei and/or their connections, making it difficult to determine the responsible structures. One of the ways of sorting this out is to have control cases with diencephalic damage but without amnesia. However, only a few such patients have been reported (Kritchevsky et al. , 1987) . (2) Reports often have either good neuropsychological Correspondence to: Dr Neill R. Graff-Radford, The Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA (Present address) .

GRAFF-RADFORD AND OTHERS documentation of amnesia (Mills and Swanson, 1978; Schott et al. , 1980; Speedie and Heilman, 1982; Goldenberg et al. , 1983; Guberman and Stass, 1983; Winocur et al. , 1984; von Cramon et al. , 1985; Rousseaux et al. , 1986; Gentilini et al. , 1987) or good anatomical description of the lesions based on autopsy or stereotactic plottings (Castaigne et al. , 1981) but only a few studies have both (Mair et al. , 1979; Barbizet et al. , 1981; Mori et al. , 1986) . Further, in some studies, memory is only tested acutely (Dehaene, 1982; Swanson and Schmidley, 1985; Bogousslavsky et al. , 1986; Meissner et al. , 1987) , and thus a chronic amnesia has not been established. The subicular cortex, which is the principal output sector of the hippocampal formation, has powerful projections to the mamillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei via the fimbria-fornix. The mamillothalamic tract connects the mamillary body to the anterior thalamic nuclei. While these are classic features of neuroanatomy, the linkage between the amygdala and dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, although known to exist experimentally, is more difficult to characterize. In particular, its spatial relationship to the mamillo- thalamic tract is unclear, although von Cramon et al. (1985) have speculated that it may course in the internal medullary lamina medial to the mamillothalamic tract. In an attempt to focus on the anatomical questions that have been raised about diencephalic amnesia, we report a two-part study. First, we studied 4 posterior commissures are identified on the midsagittal slice. (The anterior commissure is located below the juncture of the fornix and corpus callosum while the posterior commissure can be localized at the point where the cerebral aqueduct forms. ) The anterior commissure/posterior commissure line (AC/PC line) is drawn between the commissures. Next, lines marking the centres of the horizontal and coronal slices containing the lesion are superimposed by the computer on this midsaggital slice and from where these lines intersect, a line perpendicular to the AC/PC line is drawn. Measuring the distance from the anterior commissure to where the perpendicular line intersects the AC/PC line gives the distance of the centre of the coronal slice to the anterior commissure. The distance above or below the AP line of the centre of the axial slice is obtained by measuring the perpendicular height above or below the AP line of intersection of the centres of the coronal and axial slices. The medial/lateral dimension of the lesion is measured on both the axial and coronal slices and the distances from the centre of the third ventricle to the most medial centre, and most lateral part of the lesion are noted. At these 3 distances the dimensions of the lesions are measured anterior/posterior in the axial slice (s) and superior/inferior on the coronal stice (s) . The lesion is then plotted on the three sagittal plates in the Schaltenbrand and Wahren Atlas corresponding to the medial, middle, and lateral distances of the lesion from the midline. Note that the AP diameter is plotted in the same plane as the axial slice and the superior/inferior diameter the same plane as the coronal slice. The planes of the axial and coronal slices in relation to the AP line are obtained by measuring the angles these slices make when they intersect the AP line on the midsagittal view. In all instances the magnification factor of the MRI and magnification of the Atlas are taken into account. A way to check the accuracy of the above method is to take advantage of the fact that the MRI image is plotted on a grid system such that the location of anterior/posterior limits of the lesion on the axial slice, and the superior/inferior limits of the tesions on the coronal slice, can be transferred to the midsagittal slice on the anteroposterior and superoinferior grids, respectively. On the midsagittal slice, perpendicular lines are dropped from the top grid delineating the anteroposterior limits of the lesion and horizontal lines are drawn from the posterior grid delineating the superior/inferior limits of the lesion. The lesion is located where the perpendicular and horizontal lines intersect. This location in relation to the AP line can be measured and plotted in the Atlas. Anatomical study The basolateral nuclei of the amygdala in 2 monkeys were injected with tritiated amino acids and autoradiography was used to detect the anterograde axoplasmic transport. TABLE |.

        "case_report": "doi: 10. 1111/nen3. 12065 PICTURES IN NEUROLOGY Amnesia as a result of symmetrical infarction of the bilateral fornices A 51-year-old school teacher without risk factors for stroke developed sudden memory impairment. He was alert and well oriented without any focal neurological deficit. How- ever, his recent memory was disturbed. His Miyake mem- ory test was 2-7-7, and his Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28 points. He showed moderate anterograde amnesia and mild retrograde amnesia spanning a few days. His diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on admission showed small hyperintense lesions restricted to the column of the bilateral fornices. The lesions showed gadolinium enhancement on Tl-weighted images 2 weeks after hospitalization (Fig. 1) . We diagnosed infarction of the bilateral fornices, which has rarely been reported. '! The embolic source could not be determined despite further examination. It is most likely that the artery responsible was the subcallosal artery. ? The patient s amnesia gradually improved, and 8 months after onset, he was reinstated as a school teacher. Acknowledgment The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Markowitsch!, D. Yves von Cramon?, and Uwe Schuri* ! Physiological Psychology, University of Bielefeld, and 2 Neuropsychology, City Hospital Munich-Bogenhausen, Germany ABSTRACT The case of a patient with above-average intelligence and educational background, high motivation, and an approximate IQ-MQ difference of 40 points is documented. The patient has been examined repeatedly for nearly a decade. Extensive neuroradiological material of his focal bilateral brain damage in the dorsal diencephalon is available. A widespread range of cognitive tests was used to inves- tigate his actual performance on all relevant aspects of intelligence, attention, subjective memory, immediate retention, learning, skill and problem solving abili- ties, concept formation, cognitive flexibility, priming, constructional ability, retro- - grade memory, and long-term retention. The total of more than 50 tests included German-language forms of the revised Wechsler Memory Scale and of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. The patient s short-term memory and attention were, in spite of his advanced years, average or well above average. He gave a number of examples of still intact skills and implicit memory abilities, though there was no uniformity in his performance on implicit memory tests (e. g. , with respect to stored vs. new implicit information) . He had no awareness of his severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia, documented over a large range of verbal and figural tests. Taken together, the results from our patient confirm the principal dichotomy be- tween declarative and nondeclarative mnestic functions, but give evidence for some restrictions as well. They furthermore demonstrate that focal diencephalic damage may result in profound anterograde and selective retrograde amnesia, es- pecially with respect to data-based material, and that disconnecting portions of the medial and basolateral limbic circuits has devastating consequences on memory. There is marked disagreement with respect to the possible contributions of indi- vidual structures nuclear and fiber systems to the various stages of long-term information processing. The central nuclear masses of interest are the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and the mammillary bodies; sometimes Mayes et al. concluded that its locus corresponds to that of the paratenial nucleus. ) A refined analysis, however, revealed some further damage, especially in one patient. Particularly, signs of cortical atrophy were detected in one patient and reduced nucleolar volumes in layers III and V of the frontal cortex in both. In recent years several studies (e. g. , Cramon, Hebel, & Schuri, 1985; Graff- Radford, Tranel, Van Hoesen, & Brandt, 1990) and reviews (Cramon, 1992; Cramon & Markowitsch, 1992; Markowitsch, 1988) have emphazised the impor- tance of fiber systems such as the mammillothalamic tract and the internal med- ullary lamina. From the first case reports on amnesic patients (e. g. , Bonhoeffer, 1901; Claparede, 1911) it was known that global amnesia is not quite as global and complete as literally suggested, but nonetheless only recent evidence has pro- vided hints for a systematic classification of dense versus usually less affected areas of information processing in so-called amnesics. The results from the present case should be of further help in analyzing the relevant facets or dimensions of memory which are affected by dorsal diencephalic damage. In particular, we were interested in finding out whether there might be a discrepancy between general or everyday memory and more artificial, specific forms of memory, whether there might be a dissimilarity between different forms of priming, whether there is a preservation of long-term memory, whether the patient is conscious of his deficits, and whether the patient s short-term memory and other kinds of cognitive behavior, which are independent of long-term mnestic processing, are preserved. We had the opportunity of studying over an extended period a patient with above-average intelligence, above-average educational background (a former medical professor) , high motivation and with his marital partner constantly available or present. He had an approximate IQ-MQ difference of 40 points. CASE REPORT On February 10, 1982, A. B. , a right-handed 67-year-old retired professor, had the sudden onset of confusion and subsequently developed a dense retrograde Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 629 and anterograde amnesia. Neurological examination, EEG and CSF shall have been unremarkable at that time. He had no previous illness except for a TIA in August, 1973. There were no descriptions or signs of a chronic arterial hyperten- sion. On his first admission to our hospital (6/1983) the patient appeared alert and in good health. The neurological examination, the EEG, blood studies, including clotting studies, were normal. Doppler sonography hinted at an aplasia/closure of the left vertebral artery. Over the left posterior cerebral artery only a weak signal could be detected. The basilar artery revealed atherosclerotic changes without hemodynamically relevant stenosis. Cardial sources of emboli could not be found in transthoracic echocardiography. A 24-hour electrocardiogram was normal. We personally examined A. B. on an irregular basis from May, 1983 to April, 1991. Throughout this entire period there were no obvious changes in his medi- cal status. This was also confirmed by the patient s wife and his general practi- tioner. In reexamining in 1988/90 various cardiological and angiological param- eters (including a transesophageal echocardiography) , we confirmed the above mentioned findings. METHODS Neurological and Neuroradiological Examinations CT scans were performed in June, 1983 (approximately 17 months postonset, at the patient s age of 68) . Eight mm slices were obtained parallel to the fronto-occipital (FO) line. On April 9, 1991 (about 9 years postonset at the patient s age of 75) A. B. had an MRI scan, performed on a Philips Gyroscan 515. Serial T1-weighted 3 mm coronal images (TE 20; TR SE 461) through both thalami were obtained perpendicular to the FO-line. In addition, 3 mm axial slices were performed using the inversion mode (TE 30; TR IR 1900; TI 400) . Figure 1 reveals symmetrically located, columnar lesions in the polar region of both thalami afflicting all thalamic levels at least on the left side. The lesion pattern can be considered typical of infarctions in the territory of the polar ( premammillary ) thalamic artery/arteries. On the left side, the lesion area appears much larger than on the right. It cannot be excluded that this lesion extends beyond the thalamic boundary to the knee of the internal capsule. At the caudal level the lesion areas on both sides come close to the bank of the third ventricle. In the more cranial sections, the lesion areas are separated from the third ventricle by a normodense band of some diameter which can be allocated to normal thalamic tissue supplied by medial branches of the posterior choroidal arteries. If this is the case the anterior thalamic nuclear complex, which is completely supplied by this vessel, should be spared on both sides. The left lateral ventricle is slightly widened. The Septum-Caudate distance measures 15 mm on the left and 11 mm on the right. The Cella-Media-Index amounts to 0. 24, The maximum width of the third ventricle is 12 mm. The caudal part of the left sylvian fissure/ insular cistern is obviously enlarged without any clear indication of focal lesions other than the thalamic ones. The remainder of the brain appears inconspicuous. MRI scans (Fig. 2) document that the thalamic lesions detected 8 years earlier and those found in 1991 are in concordance. The T1-weighted images reveal low-intensity lesions of comparable size and location in both polar thalami. The larger lesion column on Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 630 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. Fig. 1. Original CT scans from June, 1983 illustrate symmetrically located lesions in the polar region of both thalami. The left-sided lesion is much larger than the right- sided one. The lesion pattern appears typical of infarctions in the territory of the polar (premammillary) arteries. For details see text. the left has a length of 10 mm and a diameter of approximately 5 mm. On the right side the considerably smaller lesion measures 5 mm and 1-2 mm respectively. The coronal slices illustrate the characteristically curved infarction areas which are clearly indicative for the supply area of the polar and paramedian group of thalamic arteries. At the caudal thalamic level the basal portion of the medio-dorsal thalamic nucleus are most likely damaged, but also other smaller midline nuclei (e. g. , parafascicular nuclei) and adjacent fiber projections (e. g. , the internal medullary lamina) . At the uppermost lesion level the distance from the center of the thalamic lesion columns to the sagittal plane measures about 15 mm on the left and about 10 mm on the right side. Thus, again the internal medullary lamina may be lesioned, as well as, mainly on the left side, the ventral group of the thalamic nuclei. In addition, other intrathalamic fiber projections (e. g. , the mammillothalamic tract and the anterior/inferior thalamic peduncles) could be Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 631 Fig. 2.

For details see text. afflicted. The axial IR images show that the bi-thalamic lesions obviously do not cross the border of the thalamus, thus presumably sparing the adjacent internal capsule. The central part of the left lateral ventricle is now considerably enlarged whereas other parts of the ventricle appear unchanged by comparison. The Cella-Media-Index now varies between 0. 27 and 0. 30. The Septum-Caudate distance and the maximum width of the third ventricle, however, have not changed. The insular cistern is slightly widened on the left side as the left slice in the upper row of Figure 2 demonstrates. The width of the sylvian fissures lies within values for age-matched controls. We now find multiple tiny low-intensity lesions predominantly in the left hemisphere. They involve the head of the left caudate nucleus, the anterior limb of the left internal capsule as weil as the putamen and the subinsular white matter on both sides. It seems plausible that the left-sided lesions constitute a substantial contribution to the enlarge- ment of the central part of the left lateral ventricle and to the widening of the left insular Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 632 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. cistern. Regarding the fact that the widening of the left sylvian fissure/insular cistern was already visible on CT scans from 1983, we cannot exclude that at least some of these presumably vascular microlesions might have appeared together with the thalamic infarction (s) . The case history gives no indication of additional clinical events since February 10, 1982. Individuals Used for Comparison For several of the tests (10, 20, 28, 30, 31, 36, 41-45) the patient s performance was compared with that of a 30-year-old high school teacher with a unilateral infarct of the left mediodorsal thalamic region, dating back 6 weeks from the time of testing. This patient was included as the locus of his damage was similar, but limited to one hemisphere. Furthermore, the (42) Incomplete Pictures Test was given to a number of control subjects for standardization and to 4 healthy control subjects for comparison with the patient s performance. These 4 control subjects were also involved in tests 41-45. Lastly, the results in the (49) Famous Faces Test were compared with those of 10 control subjects matched with respect to age. Tests We used a battery of tests which was intended to cover a wide range of aspects of learning, memory, and problem solving (Table 1) . In addition, sensory and language functions and number processing were checked. Intelligence, Attention, Subjective Memory (Tests 1-8) The tests specified in Table 1 were used to measure intelligence and attention. A German- language adapted version of the (8) Subjective Memory Questionnaire (SMQ) (Bennett- Levy, & Powell, 1980) was given. Memory Test Batteries; Immediate Retention Tests (Tests 9-20) As overall tests a modified German-language form of the (9) Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT; Wilson, Cockburn, & Baddeley, 1984; Hempel et al. , 1992) and a German-language adaptation of the (10) revised Wechsler-Memory-Scale (WMS-R; Wechsler, 1987; Deisinger & Markowitsch, in press) were given. The tests for immediate retention are widely described (Lezak, 1983) . Learning (Tests 21-29) Of the learning tests specified in Table 1, the (26, 27) Recurring Figures and Words tests might measure implicit memory as well, though Grafman et al. (1990) termed them to be explicit memory tests. In the (28) learning of a mathematical rule measure the patient was tested with five series or until he correctly formulated the underlying rule (Nichelli, Gahmanian-Behbahani, Gentilini, & Vecchi, 1988) . The (29) nonverbal selective remind- ing task was given as described in Muramoto (1984) . Skill Tests (Tests 30-33) (30, 31} Skill acquisition. A small table (30) calculator which is included in the German RBMT was given repeatedly. The subject s task was to reproduce a motor sequence which was explained verbally and demonstrated manually at the same time, namely to add or substract four numbers in altogether nine steps (finger presses) . The test was given on seven occasions distributed over four days. A (31) puzzle was used several times in a colored and a black form (five pieces) . The (33) mirror drawing task was performed by using a computer-controtled monitor on which the numbers 1-20 were distributed. These numbers had to be connected in sequence by using a mouse turned 180 . Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 633 Table 1.

The (45) sentence completion consisted of idioms which were embedded in sentences (examples: They sweat blood and water. , They sank with man and mouse. ) and of similarly structured sentences with two nouns which, however, were not related in an idiomatic way (example: They cook beef and vegetables. ) First, a list of all first words of the two-noun combina- tions was given and the patient had to add any word which came to mind (baseline) . Then he was shown sentences which for the sentences containing idioms gave the first, but not the second word. The subject had to write the second noun in the empty place. Furthermore, the non-idiom sentences were read aloud and repeated five times. Thereaf- ter, the same list of first words was given and the patient was asked to complete it under priming conditions. After 24 hr this list was administered a third time. The reading of the non-idiom sentences was repeated in the third session before asking the patient to com- plete the word pairs by adding the second word. (46) Phrases completion. The third verbal priming test measured the ability to recall linguistic idioms (examples: hot iron , long face ) (cf. Schacter, 1985a, 1985b) . Here, the first word of the phrase was given and a second word had to be added by the patient. Then, sentences with the common phrases and sentences with unusual combinations (ex- ee, amples: dark iron , seventh face ) were presented. After that the patient again had to complete the same list received before. Retrograde Memory and Long Term Retention (Tests 47-51) In order to further evaluate old memories he was given a (47) questionnaire which in- cluded detailed items for a number of occasions to which he had to provide answers from the period of his childhood and for the period of his last 5 years (K. Schmidtke, in preparation) . Also developed by Schmidtke was a multiple-choice version of a (48) fa- mous persons test in which altogether 40 famous persons from the time period between 1960 and the present had to be identified out of four choices per person. For the (49) famous faces test we used 120 photographs of famous individuals covering the 55-year period from 1936 to 1990.

The patient could not distinguish between pleasant and unpleasant odors (loss of olfactory hedonia) . Visual abilities, including visual- spatial abilities, were normal. The same was true for auditory functions. Language and Language-related Functions; Number Processing There was no aphasia according to the Aachener Aphasie Test (Huber, Poeck, Weniger, & Willmes, 1982) . The linguistic abilities, however, were supposedly below the (high) premorbid level. In spontaneous speech, short (elliptic) utter- ances prevailed. In responding to passive sentences, the patient often missed the agent . He did better in judging comparative constructions. Formal testing could not reveal any dyslexic or dysgraphic errors. Aside from his limiting memory deficit difficulties in drawing inferences may be the reason for his very poor comprehension of story paragraphs. Number processing was intact, errors in complex arithmetic tasks were due to his inability to store provisional results. In principle, operational procedures were available. Intelligence (Tests 1-3) ; Attention (Tests 4-7) The patient received the following T values in the German short version of the WAIS, 57 (information) , 63 (similarities) , 58 (picture completion) , 52 (block design) , and an IQ of 118 in the short vocabulary-intelligence test. In the Raven Progressive Matrices Test his value was 122. In the attention tests there was no indication for a reduced speed of informa- tion processing. In the divided attention test he concentrated on the reaction to peripheral visual stimuli (PR 98) , while his result in the tracking task was below average. Bearing in mind his age of 74 years, his overall performance appeared to be average or even above average. Subjective Memory (Test 8) ; Memory Test Batteries (Tests 9 and 10) In the SMQ the patient throughout judged his memory as good , the only excep- tions being memories for movie titles and dreams ( bad ) and for birthdays and jokes ( intermediate ) . The frequencies in which these acknowledged problems might occur, were rated as very rare . The patient stated, however, that he had always had difficulties in this area. (9) Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. In the RBMT, the patient behaved particularly poorly, gaining only 24 out of 150 possible points. His general orientation was already quite reduced, that is, he could not give the proper year, month, or day, nor the locality, his age, nor the name of the president of Ger- many. He did not gain any points on most of the subtests; only in the tests on picture and face recognition, was he significantly above chance indicating some kind of priming or feeling-of-knowing phenomenon. Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 636 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. In the (10) WMS-R the patient s results were not consistent, though his over- all general memory score was very low (65; control patient score was 71) . His ability to attend and concentrate was, on the other hand, particularly high (131; control: 102) . The values for verbal memory (45. 5; control: 74) , visual memory (79; control: 82) , and for delayed recall (54; control: 71) were low or even very low (all scores age-corrected) . Though all aspects of longer memory demonstrated his profound inability to hold or reproduce information long-term, his short-term memory abilities were in contrast remarkably high. Test results for the mental control subtest gave the maximal value (6) ; digit span forward with 11 out of 12 points had an exception- ally high value for a person of his age and also digits backward with 9 of 12 possible points was an impressively high value. Similarly, testing visual memory span forward gave the maximal score (14) and testing backward gave 6 (of 12 possible points) . Thus, his values in digit span forward and visual memory span forward were both beyond the 99th percentile. In contrast to these high values, his figural memory was quite poor. He iden- tified only 2 out of 10 figures. For the two stories he received just 4 (of 25) points for the first and 2 (of 25) points for the second story. Visual paired associate learning was similarly poor with 3 (of 18) points; in verbal paired associate learning he received 10 out of 24 possible points. In visual reproduction (copying four drawings immediately after having seen them) the patient was, compared to his performance in other subtests, much better (19 out of 41 points) . In this test he could draw the principal Gestalts of the first three simpler figures, but was quite poor with the more complicated, fourth one, indicating that he reproduced the drawings from his short-term memory. Particularly poor was his performance in delayed recall or reproduction subtests. He had no idea of the contents of the previously learned stories; he did not even know he had heard them. Giving him clues failed to refresh any memory. Visual and verbal paired associate recall resulted in 0 (of 6) and 2 (of 8) points and visual reproduction after delay provided no points. As in delayed story recall, the patient had no knowledge that he had made any drawings at all before. The results of the WMS-R therefore demonstrated a clear dissociation between short- and long-term memory functions with the patient performing significantly above average in short-term tests and well below average in longer term and especially in long-term memory. The unilateral thalamus-damaged patient appeared to do much better in most of the tests. His behavior in verbal memory was still much better than that of the bi-thalamic patient, but in visual memory and general memory he had very simi- lar scores. His ability to attend/concentrate was good, but his score was much lower than that of the old patient. In delayed recall the young patient was sub- stantially better than the old one. Comparing the values of the two patients, their general behaviora) similarity is quite impressive. However, their comparison makes all the more obvious the Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 637 very high ability of attention and concentration of the old patient, and his very poor verbal memory and delayed recall ability. Immediate Retention (Tests 11-20) In the tests on immediate retention the patient s performance was similar to that of the two memory test batteries. His digit span was 7, in a word span test he was able to repeat 4 short and 3 long nouns, 5 phonologically similar nouns, and 5 abstract nouns. His free recall of a short word list (13) was within normal range; in the larger word lists and the story (Tests 14-16) his performance deteriorated drastically: 3 (Test 14, trial 1) , 3 (Test 15, trial 1) , and 4 units in the (76) 57-unit story. In the (17) block tapping task, on the other hand, he again was able to repeat 6 correct blocks. Recognition of (18) Benton s figures was an average score of 11 and he recognized 36 faces in the (19) face recognition test, which is only slightly subaverage, considering his age. (Diesfeldt, 1990, reported for nor- mal subjects under 80 years of age a mean of 41. 5 422. 5 SD. ) The patient was quite good at copying the (20) Rey-Osterrieth figure (with 34 points at the 80th percentile) , but totally unable to draw it without seeing the pattern. For comparison, the young diencephalic damaged patient gained 20 1/2 points from drawing the figure from memory and was therefore approaching the level of the 40th percentile. Learning (Tests 21-29) In the (21) 8-pair PA task he was clearly deficient, manifesting a performance of 0, 1, 2, and 3 correct responses in the four trials given. In the (22) AVLT and the (23) CVLT his performance was clearly subaverage as well, with for the (22) AVLT - productions of 3, 3, 3, 3, and 4 correct responses, then 3 responses to list B, and finally no response to list A. So his total learning was 19, while Ivnik et al. (1990) found a mean value of 43. 1+29. 1 as average for the age range of 70-74 years. In the (23) CVLT he similarly produced only 3, 4, 3, 5, and 4 correct responses, then 2 responses in the new list, none in free recall of list 1 and 1 only in cued recall of list 1. Then, in long-term free recall, cued recall, and recognition he gave 0, 0, and 2 correct responses. In the (24) face/name PA test with 8 pairs he gave 0, 4, 1, and 1 correct responses, and in the (25) object PA (8 pairs) 1, 0, 0, and 1 answers. In the Kimura (1963) form of the (26) recurring figures test the patient was somewhat unsure in the first quarter of the test, but then he became quite strict and definite with his answers until at the end his concentration loosened. With altogether 45 out of 56 correctly identified figures and no false positive answers our patient scored well above the average of the sample of 427 healthy persons tested by Hartje and Rixecker (1978) (34. 7 figures) and was still well above the average of all normals with university education, tested by Hartje and Rixecker, receiving a value which was exceeded by less than a quarter of this sample of normals. In the (27) Recurring words test our patient was somewhat less successful, a Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 638 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. finding which parallels his results in other tests such as (11) the WMS-R. He made altogether 26 correct identifications (and 2 false positives) . This value (of 24) is subaverage even considering the patient s age (the T value of 38 is ex- ceeded by 87% of the norm population) . The patient and the young patient were both able from the end of the first series to predict the number and to formulate the (28) Fibonacci rule, This superior performance (compared to that of normal subjects or other patients; cf. Nichelli et al. , 1988) was most likely due to the spare time activities of the old patient and, for the young patient, to the fact that he had been tested and trained throughout the 6 weeks prior to our examination (in another clinic) . In the (29) figural form of the selective reminding test the patient performed well below average. He located 7, 0, 7, 2, 8, 3, 6, 5, 5, and 2 objects correctly over the 10 trials and made altogether 22 intrusion errors. Skill (Learning) Tests (Tests 30-33) The (30) skill learning by use of a calculator was given on seven occasions distributed over four days. The first time (morning session) he had absolutely no idea how to perform on the test. He did not know what to do or why to do anything. The same was true on the second occasion. On the third occasion he just pressed 8 , + and 1 . For the fourth session we then modified the test by demonstrating to him just the first six steps (adding 4 to 8 and subtracting 3) . He was able to repeat immediately this abbreviated form, indicating that his short- term memory span was normal (if not superior to normal) and that interference factors from the longer (complete) test sequence might have kept him from even starting with performance. This hypothesis appeared likely on the fifth session. When showing him the complete 9-step version again, he refused to do anything ( I cannot do this. ) , We therefore helped him ( step by step ) and then, in the final two sessions he showed at least some knowledge what the calculator was for and with help was able to do some presses without, however, having remembered the exact numbers or the sequence of ++ +. The young patient was given the calculator test twice. In the first session he was unable to follow the instructions: He just pressed 8 , M+ and then (errone- ously) the number 5 . In the second session he made 5 of the 9 steps correctly. This patient consequently had the ability to learn the principles of the task, but was less able to deal with it than are most other brain-damaged patients (Mayer, 1990) . (Based on a sample of 165 brain-damaged patients [largely infarcts], Mayer, 1990, received an average value of 7 out of 9 correctly performed steps with immediate repetition. ) (31) Skill acquisition ~ Puzzles. Our patient had no problems with the puz- zles. This was apparent from the beginning: He was quite convinced that he would manage to solve the puzzle and did so without major problems within less than 1 min a time which is lower than that needed on the average for control subjects or multiple sclerosis patients (Calabrese, Haupts, Babinsky, & Markowitsch, 1993) . In the second session he managed to complete the puzzle Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 639 pieces within about 20 s which corresponds to approximately the minimal time needed. Also, substituting the colored puzzle by a totally black version did not alter his high skill level. He was quite similar in performance to the young patient who was also above average in comparison to normal subjects and multi- ple sclerosis patients. In the (32) stylus maze and (33) mirror drawing tasks he improved over trials considerably, though at the end of each testing he apparently lost concentration or showed symptoms of fatigue. Problem solving; Concept Formation; Cognitive Flexibility (Tests 34-40) The patient s responses in the (34) Tower of Hanoi test showed little improve- ment both with respect to the number of moves and the number of errors made and in the (35) Planning test he failed totally. Probably due to the time necessary to apply the (36) match-to-sample-con- cept task, namely first the single stimulus pattern and then 10 pages each with two response stimuli, the patient was unable to identify any of the 10 concepts. In spite of being reminded from time to time what this test was intended for, he apparently failed to make the necessary comparison and to think of alternatives over time. He was quite fascinated in concrete details within the individual pictures and stressed their possible importance in spite of our repeated comments to ignore specific details and instead to look for commonalities. In the (37) abstract concept task, the patient and the other unilaterally diencephalon-damaged patient had problems in verbally formulating the abstract relationship. Contrary to Cronin-Golomb s average values of over 80% in the commissurotomised subjects and of 70% or better in the aphasics, our patient received a value of only 59% and also the young patient could make correct identifications for only 71%. In the (38) Wisconsin Card Sorting Test the patient behaved particularly poorly by making 36 errors within one tested category while his performance in the (39) Weigl s test was above average with 15 (out of 15) categories when memory load was reduced by allowing the patient to write down previous catego- ties. The patient had no problems with the (40) numbers to letters test. The (41) simple calculations did not pose any difficulty for the patient. He was eager to demonstrate his abilities and was accurate and precise in his formu- lations and writing. Priming (Tests 42-46) Overall the patient s performance in the (42) Incomplete Pictures Test test was quite poor (Fig. 3) . It is noteworthy to mention that his initial guessing was already quite poor. At no occasion did he indicate that he had seen one of the figures previously or that he had done the test before. In spite of this failure to provide evidence for explicit memory, he improved from session to session. In the first session the patient needed on average 8 steps (of 10) until he recognised which object was meant, on the second session he improved slightly, Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 640 HANS J.

Performance improvement of the old (Pat. 1) and the young (Pat. 2) patient and of the four control subjects from one session to the next (Gollin s Incomplete Figures Task) . Note the almost parallel and flat curves of the old patient and the compara- tively steep ones much more similar in the young patient and the contro] subjects from session 1 to 2. but significantly (Wilcoxon test; z = -1. 92, p < 0. 05) and this improvement also continued during the final two testing sessions, though it was much less than that of the young patient or that of the control group. The same trend was seen when using percentage values (Fig. 3b) . Figure 4 shows the slow and constant slope of his implicit learning. While from session 1 to session 2 the young patient had nearly the slope of the control subject (0. 25 and 0. 26) , the old patient had an extremely flat slope (0. 05) which furthermore was extremely constant from session to session (the percentage of reduction varying for all three comparisons between 87. 39 and 87. 89% of the original value!) . The patient was apparently well prepared for (43) mirror-image reading of presented words. He needed on the average less than 4 s to give the correct response. Therefore the sheer motor-behavior dependent times such as eye and lip movements determined a large portion of the necessary time for responding. These factors in combination discouraged testing of a possible learning progress over blocks of words. Instead, we looked for evidence of improved performance (possible priming related) when the word had been presented a second time. Here, our patient showed a slight, but consistent improvement in word reading which otherwise followed closely the time periods needed per block during the first presentation.

We therefore will not specify them here. In the (45) sentence completion test the patient was given the list containing the first words of the idiom and the non-idiom sentences without having seen them; for 33% of the words ( baseline ) he made correct associations (Fig. 5a) . On the idiom sentences he provided correct associations for 67% of the words. This result improved to 91. 7% correct when the test was repeated the next day (Fig. 5a) . On the other hand, for the non-idiom sentences he failed to produce any correct association during any of the three sessions (Fig. 5a) . It is interesting to compare his results with those of the young patient (Fig. 5b) and with those of the healthy control subjects (Fig. Sc) . With respect to the pairs of idioms there was a striking congruence in the results of the two patients. Both of them demonstrated a nearly equivalent baseline level (session 1) and improved to the same level after having completed the missing words in the sentences given. With respect to the pairing of non-idioms, on the other hand, their behavior was quite discrepant (Fig. 5a, b) : While the old patient failed to show any learning even in session 3, the young patient gained markedly from having heard the non-idiom sentences (absolutely to a percentage higher than for the idiom sentences) . It can therefore be concluded that for the young patient conscious learning was possible to a much higher degree than for the old one. Probably due to the patient s tendency to demonstrate knowledge where it was still maintained, he produced quite unusual and in part even bizarre word phrases in the (46) phrase completion test so that the number of similar answers was quite low. Of the 50 words not seen before, he gave the same word for 18 of the total in session 2 as he had done in session 1 (i. e. , for 36% of the words) . For the idioms this value was 60%. However, probably due to the assumed tendency to give unusual answers, his production was only 5 of 8 in session 1 (directly after presentation) and 4 of 8 in session 2 (one day after presentation) . Of the idioms produced correctly in the second session, only 60% were identical to those produced before. Retrograde Memory and Long-term Retention (Tests 47-51) In the (47) autobiographical memory test the patient in spite of his age - had some knowledge of his childhood (where he gained 47 points) , but he was unable to provide any memories of his recent past (2 points) . In the (48) Famous names test he was unable to name even one out of the 40 persons. Even with respect to a famous person he had personally met about a decade ago, he failed to identify her. In the (49) famous faces test the patient identified for the five decades between 1936 and 1985 25%, 10%, 5%, 0%, 5% of faces in each decade respec- Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 644 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. tively as compared to 45%, 45%, 50%, 50%, and 60% for the age-matched controls. For the years between 1986 and 1990 he identified no face. Cues and further information helped him to identify additional portraits. The patient there- fore showed his best performance in the oldest time periods measured, while the control subjects remembered most subjects from recent times. After the 2-day delay the patient was unable to recall anything of the (50) 57- unit story. In the (51) faces recognition test he performed at chance level. DISCUSSION The overall impression of our case is that of a still well-behaving and educated person with obvious behavioral insecurities which are apparent both in situations of social contact and when the patient should act on his own. The patient is still reacting competitively, tries to work efficiently, and is emotionally affected in situations of obvious failure. His wife constantly trained functions which might serve to keep the patient s intellect working. For instance, she encouraged him to solve puzzles, to memorize short-term, and to perform calculations, functions which appeared well preserved (cf. the results in the short-term tests, in tests 28, 30, 40, 41, and possibly also in test no. 33) . A. B. nevertheless seems to have at best minimal insight into his severe distur- bances. Even when commenting on some of his own statements (in the [8] SMQ) considering the way he followed all day-by-day testing implies that most of the time he does not reflect on his impairments. This judgement is confirmed in comparing his behavior with that of the second patient (who had a unilateral infarct in the same region) . Neuroanatomy The thalamic lesions detected in 1983 and those found in 1991 are consistent. The principal lesion is precisely limited to regions within the thalamus. The larger lesion in the left hemisphere corresponds to the more severe verbal memory defects found and most likely resulted in an interruption of thalamo-cortical connections with the prefrontal and temporal cortex. The performance impair- ments in several of the problem solving, concept formation and cognitive flex- ibility tests therefore may in part be due the fronto-thalamic disconnection, par- ticularly on the left side. Basically Undisturbed Abilities The patient was still clearly of superior intelligence (Tests 1-3) and usually behaved attentively (Tests 4-7, 10) . Immediate retention (Tests 10-20) perfor- mance was superior as long as the item lists remained within his short-term memory span. When this was the case, he was surprisingly good, sometimes beyond the 99th percentile (10: WMS-R) . Impairments in verbal supramemory span tests seem to surpass nonverbal ones (which corresponds to the larger lesion in the left hemisphere) . Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 645 The patient had no problems with (28) learning a mathematical rule, with (40) transcoding numbers to letters, (41) simple calculations, with (31) solving puz- ales, or in (39) Weigl s color form sorting test. This means that his cognitive flexibility was still existent on the mathematical and problem solving level (s) , that is, with respect to nondeclarative memory. From all these tests and from similar ones (e. g. , 30) it became apparent that he had a high short-term memory span which, whenever exceeded, resulted in an immediate and drastic performance drop. Learning, Concept Formation, and Cognitive Flexibility The patient had severe learning problems both with verbal and figural material (tests 9, 10, 21-25, 29) ; he furthermore had massive problems in ordering his environment by identifying commonalities and differences (tests 36, 37) or by switching from one behavioral tendency to a new one (test 38) . Generally, learn- ing was substantially impaired across all modalities with at most a minor ten- dency for even greater problems on the verbal compared to the figural level (tests 10, 21-25, 29) . This global, little differentiated, learning impairment is explain- able by the bilateral, largely symmetrical, diencephalic damage. The manifold defects early in information processing are in line with the hypothesis that diencephalic in comparison to medial temporal-lobe damage al- ready affects the early stage of information encoding and may therefore be viewed as the most fundamental form of amnesia (Winocur, 1984) . The poor behavior in the (36, 37) concept learning tasks is attributable to possible frontal lobe signs, as the patient generally was inflexible, fixated, and as his limited memory span did not allow him to think over what had previously come to his mind. This limited memory span most likely also discouraged him from attacking similar problem analyses. Implicit Memory Abilities The range of implicit memory tasks used in various patient groups has consider- ably expanded (e. g. , Grafman et al. , 1990; Heindel, Salomon, & Butters, 1990; Verfaellie, Bauer, & Bowers, 1991) . In parallel, the theory of implicit memory processing has been refined (e. g. , Dunn & Kirsner, 1989; Horner, 1990) . Hirst (1989) , for example, suggested the existence of a Coherence Model which states that amnesics encode events, but not the connections between them (p. 33) , that is, he differentiated between the encoding of content and the encoding of a larger context (p. 46) . The finding of Neill, Beck, Bottalico, and Molloy (1990) also seems worth mentioning that implicit, as well as explicit memory, depend more on the similarity of information processed during study and testing, than on similarity of type of process, whether data driven or conceptually driven. Following this line of argument, our interpretation of our patient s perform- ance in implicit memory tasks can demonstrate only general trends, but not strict, unequivocally determinable, inferences. Aside from tests 42-46, implicit memory processes may play a major role in the skill (learning) and problem solving tests (tests 30-33) . Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 646 HANS J, MARKOWITSCH ET AL. The occurrence of implicit memory processes seems evident from his per- formance in the (32) stylus maze and (33) mirror drawing tasks, but not in the more complex tests which very likely combine implicit and explicit memory components (e. g. , [34] tower of Hanoi test) . His performance in picture and face recognition in subtests of the (9) RBMT likewise may reflect priming or feeling- of-knowing phenomena. His results in these tests correspond to similar findings in diencephalic-damaged patients (Martone, Butters, Payne, Becker, & Sax, 1984; Nichelli et al. , 1988) . Though the results in the priming tasks in general reveal that our patient was indeed capable of long-term implicit information processing, his particular his- tory interfered with his performance: On the one hand the patient had the ten- dency to make things perfect or better than average; on the other hand his brain damage was long-term and severe. Both the very poor starting level in identify- ing the (42) incomplete pictures and his complete failure to acquire any (45) non- idiom words over three sessions reflect his profound amnesia. It seems obvious that he had at most a very limited ability to associate present and past data or to combine or reformulate time-spaced information. His continuous improvement in the (42) incomplete pictures test is all the more astonishing and documents once again the likelihood of the existence of different brain circuits for the processing of episodic and priming information (cf. Grafman et al. , 1990; Heindel et al. , 1990) . Another interpretation of his performance in verbal priming tasks seems likely as well: As is clearly shown in the (45) Priming Sentence completion, the patient was quite able to (re-) learn or process known idioms (word-pair combi- nations) , but failed to learn any newly introduced ones. It therefore seems possi- ble that his ability for priming of stored information was preserved to a much higher degree than that for new information. The ineffective handling of the (34) tower of Hanoi problem and of the (35) Planning tests is not surprising consider- ing the patient s severe retention deficit as soon as his short-term memory span is exceeded, and his inability to keep in mind individual steps of a larger (proce- dural) sequence. Explicit Memory Abilities The most profound deficits were found in some of the tests involving at least an intermediate memory (tests 9, 10, 21, 35, 47-51) , though the patient himself principally denied his problems (test 8) . As performance on the nondeclarative level was preserved to a much higher degree than on the declarative level, we conclude that reflection, time-ordering and monitoring of the own thoughts are the factors profoundly impaired in our patient. The standard form of the (26) recurring figures test may be solved on the basis of implicit memory processing and could then explain the patient s good performance. Implicit memory processing may also have helped him in the (27) verbal analogue of the recurring test, though we assume that here the patient s obviously still large vocabulary resulted in interference effects. Furthermore, the Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA 647 generally larger lesion in the left diencephalon may have contributed to the inferior behavior in the verbal as opposed to the figural form. In all standard tests involving the active recall and retrieval of information after a time delay (tests 9, 10, 21, 50, 51) the patient was substantially impaired or failed to demonstrate any memory at all. The impairments were massive on verbal and nonverbal levels. Of special interest was, of course, his remote memory (tests 47-49) and this in general revealed the frequently found pattern following Ribot s (1882) law: a good or even superior memory for remote events and a grossly defective memory for events from the last years, As cuing was of help in the (49) famous faces test, this and related evidence from other tests suggest that the medial diencephalic area, similar to the medial temporal-lobe area, is primarily involved in informa- tion acquisition for successful storage and not in information retrieval where the anterior temporal cortex might be more central (Kapur, Young, Bateman & Kennedy, 1989; Markowitsch et al. , in press) . A reduced possibility of interac- tion between temporal lobe and diencephalic structures (see e. g. , Markowitsch, Emmans, Irle, Streicher, & Preilowski, 1985) provides a likely basis for explain- ing the selective remote memory defects in our patient, though he showed at most minor evidence for direct temporal lobe-related damage (subinsular bilat- eral white matter microlesions) . Alternatively, but also in line with the discon- nection argument, would be the hypothesis that a disruption of interaction with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may produce impoverished retrieval of remote memories (see the discussion in Markowitsch et al. , in press) . The degree of remote memory impairment in so-called global amnesics has been a subject of some dispute in recent years (Cermak, 1984; Kapur et al. , 1989; Mair et al. , 1979; Markowitsch & Pritzel, 1985; Squire, 1987) . In some cases severe retrograde amnesia may occur despite the failure to detect focal brain damage (e. g. , Kapur et al. , 1989, Salmon, Lasker, Butters, & Beatty, 1988) so that it has not been possible up to now to establish a direct relation to site and extent of damage. Squire (1987) discussed several studies on non-Korsakoff patients with diencephalic damage and found no consistent results for such lesioned patients. He assumed that remote memory impairment should depend on lesions other than, and in addition to, those that produce anterograde amnesia (p. 217) . One may speculate that remote memory impairments increase with the age of the patient at the time point of brain damage and may also increase with the duration of the anterograde amnesia. Assuming that old memories are stored especially in areas of the association cortex (e. g. , Kapur et al. , 1989) and that information is stored in a network form as proposed, for example, by Brown (1990) and Mesulam (1990) , it seems logical that for the more recent past, liter- ally spoken, the connecting, associating strings become lost more and more due to non-use and due to their wired structure being less fine, while events from the remote past still are intensely and multiply wired so that there are (depending on use or reinforcement) still numerous ways to gain access to them. As the number of new facts and episodes is severely limited and as items of the recent past Downloaded by [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] at 05: 38 25 August 2014 648 HANS J. MARKOWITSCH ET AL. shrink, even a rebound effect may be postulated to exist for the most remote memories which consequently may be produced with increasing frequency and detail. The neuroanatomical diversity in cases with remote memory defects has defi- nitely grown considerably during the last few years so that this aspect of the amnesic symptomatology at present seems far from an anatomical assignment. FINAL CONCLUSIONS We started with the statement that memory is a complicated matter, especially when studied in brain-damaged subjects. Our analysis of the cognitive and mnestic abilities of our patient revealed that a facade or skeleton of intellectual functions may be well-preserved in spite of profound anterograde and (more selective) retrograde amnesia, including an amnesia for everyday memories. In the absence of major cortical damage amnesic patients may indeed preserve well-functioning intellectual habitus up to old age, though being unable to reflect their behavior. Our case demonstrates that at first glance a patient may still appear highly profi- cient as long as he can rely on an elaborated array of skill- and training- or practice-based facilities. On the other hand selective tests clearly documented the patient s helplessness in controlling, reflecting, or even comprehending the dimension of time. (When asked about the actual year, he consistently gave that of his infarct. ) The ability to integrate and to separate events in time had been lost for the period from the infarct onward. One had the feeling that conscious- ness was reduced in the patient and that incoming information passed by as in a state of dreaming. The quite constant mood of the patient underlined the impres- sion of somnambulism. Already van der Horst (1932) emphasized the impor- tance of the time dimension in amnesia by stating that memory defects in Korsakoff s patients are mainly found when temporalization is important. He concluded that the immediate grasping of time (as a dimension) and the function- ing of the dimension of time as a principle of ordering are disturbed. REFERENCES Bennett-Levy, J.

Mair, Warrington, and Weiskrantz in 1979 observed a com- bined damage of principally two structures in their patients, namely a corre- sponding bilateral damage of the region between the mediodorsal nucleus and the subependymal tissue next to the third ventricle together with a degeneration of the mammillary nuclei. The more recently published case descriptions of two Korsakoff patients (Mayes, Meudell, Mann, & Pickering, 1988) revealed, at first glance, quite similar psychometric and neuroanatomical deviations as those in the cases of Mair and co-workers.

Problem Solving; Concept Formation; Cognitive Flexibility (Tests 34-40) Of these tests the (35) Planning test (Stolze, 1991) required the solution of three tasks of equal difficulty without a time limit. Each task comprised five different items to be scheduled on an agenda implying that all items had to be done within 6 hours (times required for a certain affair were presented on five cards) . The test score was defined by the number of correctly scheduled items (maximum score 3 x 5 = 15 for the three tasks) . (36, 37) Concept Learning. Two concept learning tasks were applied, one as a (36) match- from sample task similar to that used previously in monkeys and human beings (Irle & Markowitsch, 1987; 10 concepts) , and one modified from the (37) abstract concepts used by Cronin-Golomb (1986) (17 concepts) .

Tests of Implicit Memory and Priming (Tests 42-46) The (42) Incomplete Pictures Test was used in a version with 20 items (individual concrete objects) which were presented in 10 versions from nearly nonidentifiable [1] to complete [10] (Gollin, 1960) . We (Henke, Landis, & Markowitsch, in press) had given our 10-step version to 63-80 subjects (the depending on the picture) . Based on the data of the test, subjects cumulated percentage-ranks were calculated over the 10 steps. In this way we obtained absolute step values. The data of the 20 pictures were thus comparable and had interval scale level. The cumulated percent ranks were used as data for the analysis (cf. e. g. , the results in Fig. 3) . For the (43) mirror image reading of selected words we followed in part the methods described in Nichelli et al.

Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care, North York, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Summary Isolated retrograde amnesia is defined as impaired recollection of experiences pre-dating brain injury with relatively preserved anterograde learning and memory. We present findings from a patient (M. L. ) with isolated retrograde amnesia following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) that address hypotheses of the inter- relationships of focal neuropathology, episodic memory and the self. M. L. is densely amnesic for experiences predating his injury, but shows normal anterograde memory performance on a variety of standard tests of recall and recognition. The cognitive processes underlying this performance were examined with the remember/ know technique, which permits separation of episodic from non-episodic contributions to memory tests by quantifying subjects reports of re-experiencing aspects of the encoding episode. The results demonstrated that M. L. does not episodically re-experience post-injury events to the same extent as control subjects, although he can use familiarity or other non-episodic processes to distinguish events he has experienced from those he has not experienced. M. L. s MRI showed damage to the right ventral frontal cortex and underlying white matter, including the uncinate fasciculus, a frontotemporal band of fibres previously hypothesized to mediate retrieval of specific events from one s personal past.

O PET paradigm that reliably activated this frontal region in both healthy controls and patients with TBI carefully matched to M. L. (but without isolated retrograde amnesia) . He also showed increased left inferomedial temporal activation relative to control subjects, suggesting that his spared anterograde memory is mediated through increased reliance on medial temporal lobe structures. Re-experiencing events as part of one s past is based on autonoetic awareness, i. e. awareness of oneself as a continuous entity across time. This form of awareness also supports the formulation of future goals and the implementation of a behavioural guidance system to achieve them. The findings from this study converge to suggest that M. L. has impaired autonoetic awareness attributable to right ventral frontal lobe injury, including right frontal-temporal disconnection. Reorganized brain systems mediate certain preserved cognitive operations in M. L. , but without the normal complement of information concerning the self with respect to both past and future events.

Levine et al. (A) -9mm -4mm +1mm Uncinate fasciculus Introduction Amnesia following brain damage is typically characterized by a deficit in the acquisition and retention of new information (anterograde amnesia) . Impaired recall of information acquired prior to the onset of the damage (retrograde amnesia) has traditionally been observed in the context of anterograde amnesia attributable to medial temporal or diencephalic damage (Squire and Alvarez, 1995) , and is nearly always less severe than anterograde amnesia. In the past two decades, the opposite pattern, referred to as focal or isolated retrograde amnesia, has been reported in patients without medial temporal/diencephalic pathology (N. Kapur, 1993) . The semantic-episodic distinction (Tulving, 1972, 1983) provides a useful framework for conceptualizing differences in patterns of retrograde amnesia (Cermak, 1985) . Semantic impairment (i. e. deficient factual knowledge about the world or oneself) is usually assessed with materials that received wide exposure in the patient s culture prior to the injury, such as famous faces or events. Many isolated retrograde amnesia patients show deficits for such information (e. g. N. Kapur et al. , 1986, 1989, 1992; O Connor et al. structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging and cognitive psychological testing in a case of isolated retrograde amnesia with a unique and potentially illuminating lesion localization. We investigated two issues: (i) the neuropathology of isolated retrograde amnesia and (ii) the processes supporting preserved anterograde mnemonic function in isolated retrograde amnesia. Neuropathology of isolated retrograde amnesia No single lesion has accounted for the spectrum of isolated retrograde amnesia syndromes. Medial temporal and diencephalic structures, while associated with retrograde amnesia (Butters and Stuss, 1989; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Squire and Alvarez, 1995; Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997) , are more strongly associated with anterograde amnesia; cases of isolated retrograde amnesia are not characterized by damage in these regions. Most cases of isolated retrograde amnesia are precipitated by either traumatic brain injury (TBI) or herpes simplex encephalitis, suggesting that multifocal lesions are necessary (Damasio, 1989; Markowitsch, 1995; N. Kapur, 1997) . Critical locations for the focal lesions have included the anterior temporal lobes, frontal lobes and posterior regions. The anterior temporal region, which receives input from every sensory association area as well as from limbic nuclei, is considered integration cortex involved in the cataloguing of multimodal memory traces (Damasio et al. , 1985; Markowitsch et al. , 1985) and a convergence zone important in triggering cortical representations (Penfield, 1975; O Connor et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993a; N. Kapur, 1997) . While isolated retrograde amnesia is more likely to result from bilateral anterior temporal lesions (N. Kapur et al. , 1996) , there is spared cerebral mechanisms participate in recovery from, or compensation for, cognitive deficits (Heiss et al. , 1993; Engelien et al. , 1995; Weiller et al. , 1995; Buckner et al. , 1996) . In cases of isolated retrograde amnesia following brain injury, anterograde mnemonic processes may be supported through a re-organized system, but recollection of remote events formerly mediated through lesioned pathways remains disrupted (Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Markowitsch, 1995; N. Kapur et al. , 1996) . Some evidence in favour of this hypothesis comes from an early '*3Xe study of regional cerebral blood flow (tCBF) responses during retrieval activation in a patient with left medial temporal pathology who had recovered from anterograde amnesia but had persistent temporally graded isolated retrograde amnesia (Wood et al. , 1980a) . In response to an anterograde recognition memory task, healthy subjects showed bilateral occipital rCBF suppression that was hypothesized to be inversely related to hippocampal flow (Wood et al. , 1980b) . In contrast, the patient, whose performance was normal, showed occipital suppression only on the right side. It appeared that her recovered anterograde memory performance was mediated by the intact (right) hippocampus without any contribution from the left hippocampus. Functionally reorganized mediation of test performance ollowing brain damage should affect the underlying cognitive processes, even if it is not reflected in the test performance itself. In addition to the above rCBF study, behavioural evidence of altered anterograde mnemonic functioning comes rom case studies of isolated retrograde amnesia in which standard memory tests back in time to an earlier experienced event. As will be elaborated later, episodic memory is but one manifestation of autonoetic awareness, which also affects one s management of future events (i. e. personally-relevant plans, goals and expectations) . Semantic memory, on the other hand, entails noetic awareness, a more general capacity for awareness of knowledge derived from familiarity or other implicit information that can occur in the absence of mentally re-experiencing the encoding episode (Tulving, 1985; Wheeler et al. , 1997) . We suggest that the episodic impairment in patients with isolated retrograde amnesia and right frontal dysfunction arises from a deficit in autonoetic awareness. Summary The neuropathological substrate of isolated retrograde amnesia has not been precisely delineated. Cases with documented lesions have frontal, anterior temporal or posterior (inferior temporal, parietal or occipital) damage in the context of multifocal injury. Clearly, there is heterogeneity in both lesion configuration and behavioural deficits in patients with retrograde amnesia (N. Kapur, 1997) . In this paper, we focus on retrograde amnesia specific to episodic memory for autobiographical events pre-dating the injury that has been linked to right anterior temporal/ventral frontal damage. By definition, isolated retrograde amnesia patients have Retrograde amnesia 1955 relatively preserved anterograde memory test performance, but several reports indicate abnormalities in their anterograde mnemonic processes as evidenced by altered retrieval-related rCBF or accelerated forgetting. We propose that the episodic memory deficit in patients with isolated retrograde amnesia following right frontal/temporal damage is attributable to a deficit in autonoetic awareness. As such, it is not limited to events pre-dating the injury, but is also present for events encountered after recovery has taken place. We further propose that patients intact anterograde memory test performance is accomplished through reliance on non-injured neurocognitive systems served by noetic awareness. The effects of reliance on these systems in the absence of episodic recall should be observable through patients subjective reports, quantified with the R/K technique. Patient M. L. We present a case of severe TBI with isolated retrograde amnesia (patient M. L. ) in which neuropathology and mechanisms of new learning were analysed with structural and functional neuroimaging as well as the R/K technique. There are several features that make this case unique. Because MLL. was enrolled in a separate study on the acute effects of TBI (Schwartz et al. , 1998) , he was followed by us from the date of injury and his injury severity and acute recovery characteristics were meticulously documented. Although M. L. had a very severe brain injury, he made a good neuropsychological recovery, including good performance on anterograde learning tests in spite of his significant isolated retrograde amnesia. To examine the neuroanatomical correlates of M. L. s behaviour, an MRI was done with gradient echo, spin echo and 3D T, -weighted sequences. The main site of damage was in the right ventral frontal cortex and white matter, including the uncinate fasciculus, making him a good candidate to test the frontal-temporal disconnection hypothesis in isolated retrograde amnesia. Considering previous research on the role of the right frontal lobe in episodic retrieval (Milner et al. , 1985; Tulving et al. , 1994; Fink et al. , 1996; Nyberg et al. , 1996a; Schacter et al. , 1996b) and the location of M. L. s lesion, we predicted that he would show right frontal dysfunction relative to control subjects in response to anterograde episodic retrieval tasks. We tested this hypothesis using H, ! O PET paradigms that were previously shown to elicit a specific pattern of left and right frontal rCBF activations during episodic encoding and retrieval, respectively (S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) , a pattern known as HERA (Hemispheric Encoding/Retrieval Asymmetry; Tulving et al. , 1994) . If M. L. s right frontal contribution to anterograde learning tasks is impoverished, task performance must be mediated through a preserved neural system involved in memory. A likely candidate would be the medial temporal lobe memory system (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991) which is activated in association with successful retrieval of recently learned verbal information (Grasby et al. , 1993; Nyberg et al. , 1996b; 1956 B. Levine et al. Schacter et al. , 1996a; Rugg et al. , 1997) . Left lateralization of this effect would be predicted on the basis of the verbal materials in our PET task, on the lateralization of the previous medial temporal PET findings and on the right frontal temporal disconnection in M. L. Finally, we attempted to dissociate the impaired and spared aspects of M. L. s anterograde memory processes with the R/K technique, where we predicted low R responses in comparison with control subjects (reflecting impaired episodic memory and autonoetic awareness) , without a deficit in K responses (reflecting spared semantic and other non- episodic processes corresponding to noetic awareness) . Case report Background information MLL. completed high school and 3 years of technical training in electronics. Developmental history was normal and there was no history of learning problems; he was an average to high-average student. He worked in various sales and service positions. At the time of his injury, he had been selling high- technology factory automation equipment for 2 years and was the top-rated salesperson in his company. M. L. was an active hobbyist and athlete, competing at the regional level in wine-tasting, running and bicycling. Apart from a left shoulder injury from a bicycling accident in 1992, he was previously healthy. There was no reported history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse in M. L. or his family. He was married in 1987. At the time of his accident in 1993, he had a 2-year-old daughter and his wife was pregnant with his son. He is right-handed with no history of left-handedness in his immediate family. Injury characteristics In June 1993, M. L. sustained a severe TBI when he was struck by a car while cycling. His Glasgow Coma Scale score (Teasdale and Jennett, 1974) at the scene of the injury was 10 (of 15) , and it deteriorated to 3 upon hospital admission, and was 7. 5 at 6 h (pro-rated due to intubation) . Additional injuries included a small left pneumothorax, left shoulder lacerations and possible spine subluxation. Serial CTs were classified according to criteria specified by Marshall et al. (1992) . The initial head CT carried out upon hospital admission was normal. On the sixth day post-injury, CT showed a small subdural haematoma along the falx and right tentorium, small left inferior posterior temporal contusions, small right frontal lobe contusions, mild diffuse oedema and small bifrontal subdural hygromas. He remained unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale score <8) for 6 days; this coma was followed by 1 week of delirium and agitation. After 33 days, he was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital. During hospitalization, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) was being assessed daily with the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (Levin et al. , 1979) . M. L. s score was 69 on day 32 and 95 on day 33 (maximum score = 100) . Therefore, by the criterion of two consecutive Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test scores of =75 (Levin et al. , 1979) , MLL. was still in PTA at the time of discharge. Thus, we conservatively place M. L. s PTA duration at 34 days. Recovery In the rehabilitation hospital, M. L. received in-patient speech, occupational, psychological and physical therapies for 10 weeks. In the early phases of this rehabilitation, confabulation was observed. For example, the day after walking to the hospital s patio for the first time, M. L. claimed he had just walked to Lake Ontario, several kilometres away. M. L. s retrograde amnesia was apparent immediately upon his recovery of consciousness, when he did not recognize family members or friends. During the post-acute phase, he incorrectly reported aspects of his personal past. Initially, this retrograde amnesia was observed in the context of a generalized retrieval deficit including impairment in semantic knowledge. For example, he did not appreciate the significance of his wife s physical appearance of advanced pregnancy. Object naming was impaired (Boston Naming Test score = 40) and he made gross grammatical and spelling errors in writing. Through rehabilitation and aggressive efforts of his own (e. g. recording unfamiliar words in a notebook and looking up their definitions) , M. L. s semantic deficits recovered and he re-learned significant facts of his own past, but his ability to re-experience events pre-dating the injury showed little change. To date (4 years and 8 months post- injury) , his recall of events from his personal past has been limited to a handful of fragmented images, not specific in time or place, with no temporal gradient. Upon his return home, M. L. s judgement errors necessitated supervision. He has had considerable difficulty understanding and executing his responsibilities as a parent (e. g. allowing his children to play in dangerous situations) . Over time, he has taken on increased parenting responsibilities by applying structured routines with the help of his wife. At the time of this writing, he was acting as house-husband. Although he was unable to resume his former sales position, his employer gave him a part-time trial with reduced responsibilities. This trial failed due to fatigue and difficulty managing the long commuting distance. He has pursued volunteer positions, but has not secured paid employment. Apart from retrograde amnesia, persistent symptoms have included impaired sensory functioning in his right knee, sleep maintenance difficulties, absence of hunger/thirst sensations and fatigue. Socially, he reported difficulty knowing how to behave around family members and friends, and had to be taught socially acceptable behaviour. His wife noted that he has retained little of his former outgoing personality. Furthermore, in spite of his normal performance on standard memory tests, M. L. reported a feeling of subjective distance from recall of events occurring after his recovery. M. L. s pre-morbid personality, injury characteristics and recovery pattern are inconsistent with functional or psychogenic retrograde amnesia (Schacter et al. , 1982; Kopelman, 1995; Markowitsch, 1996) . Nevertheless, a psychogenic contribution to M. L. s behaviour was probed with a sodium amytal interview. While this procedure had no permanent effect on his memory disorder, during the interview M. L. described some events that were previously lost to him. In response to very general prompts or prompts about life periods, he recalled two events from high school as well as a visit by some friends that occurred during PTA. He was also prompted with five highly emotional events from his life that had not been discussed with him since the injury. Of these, two were recognized and elaborated upon by MLL. He had no recognition of the other three. The pre-injury events recalled during the sodium amytal interview, like the other scattered pre-injury events that he has spontaneously recalled, were lacking in temporal, spatial and emotional contextual information. In particular, he was unable to describe what his emotional reactions were at the time of these events, even though they were of a highly emotional nature (e. g. a friend s death) . Therefore, the evidence of a positive sodium amytal abreaction was at best partial in that few events were retrieved, and several highly significant events were not recognized. Furthermore, it highlighted M. L. s inability to re-experience the events that he does recall. Neurological examination Apart from impaired position sense and numbness in his right leg and generally brisk reflexes, neurological examination was normal. Due to visual complaints, a neuro-opthamological consultation was sought (in August 1995) . The Humphrey automated visual field showed a subtle upper right quadratic defect, greater for the right eye than for the left eye. The examination was otherwise normal. Clinical scans An early 1994 Tc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime) -SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomo- graphy) scan showed left superior medial parietal hypoperfusion, but this resolved in a repeat SPECT scan conducted 1 year later. A late 1994 ['F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET study of resting glucose metabolism was normal. Brain MRI with gradient echo, spin echo and 3D T, -weighted sequences showed several foci consistent with post-acute severe TBI. The largest area of damage was in the right ventral frontal cortex and white matter, although there were other smaller foci. These findings are described in detail below. Neuropsychological assessment In our August 1994 assessment, basic neuropsychological functions had recovered, including anterograde memory; Retrograde amnesia 1957 intellectual testing indicated abilities in the average to high- average range (see Table 1) . There was evidence of a relative deficit on tests of visuoperceptual and visuomotor processes, a finding also noted on previous clinical neuropsychological evaluations. While his performance on several tests was most probably influenced by prior assessments, we also administered tests developed in our laboratory to which M. L. had not been previously exposed. Most notably, his performance on all measures from a word list learning task sensitive to frontal dysfunction (Stuss et al. , 1994a) was normal, as were performances on tests of conditional associative learning (Levine et al. , 1997) and conceptual processing (Levine et al. , 1995) , both experimental tests of executive functioning associated with the frontal lobes. The only test in our battery on which M. L. was significantly impaired was a strategy application measure modelled on Shallice and Burgess s Six-Element Task (Shallice and Burgess, 1991; Levine et al. , 1998) . This test consists of a arge number of simple paper and pencil tasks (e. g. naming common objects) , some of which have a high payoff and others which do not. Subjects learn the basic constraints of the test and are told values of the items, but they must decide how to budget their time to maximize points. Although M. L. learned the rules and could do the items, he approached the whole test in a sequential manner, doing items indiscriminately without respect to their value. Whereas the mean (+ SEM) proportion of high payoff items completed by 20 TBI control subjects (friends and family members of TBI subjects) was 0. 81 + 0. 042 (Levine et al. , 1998) , M. L. s proportion was only 0. 21. On the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, 1994) , M. L. achieved near maximum scores for personal semantic information, but recall of autobiographical events (episodes) was impaired for childhood and early adult periods. Recent autobiographical event recall was normal, but limited to post-injury events. Similarly, nearly all events recalled in response to cue words (Crovitz and Schiffman, 1974) had occurred <1 month prior to testing. A vocational assessment conducted in August 1995 was notable for scores on mechanical comprehension, electronics and arithmetic knowledge which were uncharacteristically low for someone with M. L. s technical background. He could not, for example, complete algebraic equations. Summary MLL. sustained a severe TBI. Following an extended post- traumatic amnesia, he had a generalized retrieval deficit for semantic knowledge (both personal and non-personal) and autobiographical episodes. Over time, his retrograde amnesia was isolated to episodes from his personal past, although there was evidence of residual retrieval deficits for some semantic information (i. e. complex arithmetic or mechanical knowledge) . Neuropsychological deficits were limited to subtle visuomotor and visuoperceptual problems and a low score on a novel test of strategy application. Neurological 1958 B. Levine et al.

There was neuroimaging evidence of cortical and subcortical lesions consistent with TBI sequelea, most prominently in the right ventral frontal lobe. Methods Subjects Two groups of subjects served as controls for the PET and behavioural studies. M. L. s activation PET data were compared with data from 12 subjects in previous studies of the functional neuroanatomy of verbal encoding (S. Kapur et al. , 1996) and retrieval (Cabeza et al. , 1997) (see Table 2) . To control for the effects of TBI, we also applied the PET paradigm to four TBI subjects (with no significant retrograde amnesia) , matched as closely as possible to M. L. for age, education, TBI severity, recovery as measured by standard neuropsychological tests and time since injury (Subjects 1-4 in Table 2) . A fifth TBI control subject was used for the R/K testing, but not the PET study (Subject 5 in Table 2) . TBI control Subject 1 did not participate in the R/K testing. MRI In order to achieve precise lesion localization information in MLL. and to localize PET activations in M. L. and the TBI control subjects, these subjects were scanned with a 1. 5-T MR system (Signa version 4. 7, General Electric) . A sagittal T, -weighted 3D volume technique produced 124 1. 3-mm slices [repetition and echo times (TR and TE) were 35 and 5 ms, respectively, flip angle was 35 , number of excitations (NEX) was 1. 0 and a field of view of 22 cm) ]. Proton density and T>-weighted images with a slice thickness of 3 mm were obtained using an interleaved sequence (TR/TE of 3000/30, 80 ms, 0. 5 NEX and a field of view of 22 cm) . Gradient echo T, sequences with a slice thickness of 6 mm were obtained to emphasize haemosiderin deposits (TR/TE of 750/ 35 ms, flip angle of 20 , 2. 0 NEX and a field of view of 22 cm) . For M. L. , the MRI was conducted 2. 4 years post-injury. TBI subjects MRI scans occurred within 1 month of their PET scans (see Table 2) . Lesion localization on M. L. s images was accomplished Note. All tests administered in standard format as described by Spreen and Straus (1991) with the following exceptions: Word list learning (Stuss et al. , 1994a) , Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, 1994) , Crovitz cue-word test (Moscovitch and Melo, 1997; autobiographical events only) , WCST (Milner, 1964; all 128 cards administered) , Stroop Interference Procedure (Stuss, 1991a) , Conditional Associative Learning (Levine et al. , 1997) , Concept Generation (Levine et al. , 1995) , Strategy Application (Levine et al. , 1998) .

PET The activation PET studies were done on a GEMS- Scanditronix PC2048-15B head scanner. M. L. and the TBI control subjects were scanned from 3. 3 to 4. 4 years post- injury (see Table 2) . Eight 60 s scans were performed, separated by an 11 min inter-scan interval and preceded by an injection of 40 mCi of H, ! O. Stimuli for this study consisted of eight lists of 24 semantically related word pairs (e. g. penguin -tuxedo) presented on a computer screen at a fixed rate of 4 s per pair with a | s inter-stimulus interval. During the encoding scans, subjects were instructed to make a mental note of any meaningful relation between the words in each pair and to say the second word aloud. Cued recall was tested during the retrieval scans by presenting the first word of each pair, followed by WORD? . Subjects said the second word of the pair, or said Pass if they could not remember the word. The study lists for the retrieval scans were presented during the inter-scan interval 1-2 min prior to the retrieval tasks. The instructions for these tasks were identical to those used during the encoding scans. Retrieval of the stimuli presented during the encoding scans was tested at the end of the scanning session. The TBI subjects and M. L. alternately performed the encoding and retrieval tasks during eight scans, beginning with retrieval. The healthy control subjects performed the encoding and retrieval tasks during four scans (two encoding and two retrieval) , counterbalanced with additional reading and recognition conditions that were analysed for other studies (S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) . In order to increase the number of scans available for encoding and retrieval (thereby increasing the stability of the signal for the small group studies) , reading and recognition were not administered to the TBI control subjects and M. L. Therefore, for all subjects, encoding and retrieval served as comparisons for one another. To correct for inter-scan head movement, subjects scans were realigned to their first scan using the AIR software (Woods et al. , 1992) . The Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used to transform the realigned scans into a standard space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) and to smooth them using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum of 10 mm. The differential effects of encoding and retrieval on rCBF across groups were estimated using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) , with the changes in global counts as covariates (Friston et al. , 1995) . Data were analysed using two-way ANCOVA in SPM as 1960 B. Levine et al. two studies (healthy control subjects or TBI control subjects versus M. L. ) , with two conditions (encoding versus retrieval) . The threshold for significance in within-study comparisons and interactions was P < 0. 001 (uncorrected, one-tailed) . Localization of activations was accomplished with the assistance of the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (1988) and the Talairach Daemon database server on the World Wide Web (http: //ric. uthscsa. edu/projects/talairachdaemon. html) . Region of interest analyses Several of the PET findings concerned hippocampal activations. Because of the importance of these findings to our predictions, and because of potential problems inherent in localization of small structures on transformed images of patients with brain damage, we confirmed these findings in the TBI control subjects and in M. L. with region-of-interest analyses. Hippocampal regions of interest were defined anatomically in the coronal plane of the MRIs, resliced with Analyze into 57 slices orientated perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus (for details of our methods for defining hippocampal volumes, see Kidron et al. , Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) (see Fig. 1) suggests interruption of the ventral frontal aspect of the right uncinate fasciculus. As expected with severe TBI, there were additional pathological foci, although none were of similar size to the right ventral frontal damage. Most appeared as hypo- intensities on T, and gradient echo images and were indicative of haemosiderin deposits. These were noted in the genu of the left anterior internal capsule, bilaterally at the cortical subcortical junction in the posterior superior frontal lobes and bilaterally in the occipital lobes. Additionally, a small hyperintense lesion was noted in the white matter deep to the left frontal lobe on the T-weighted images. The full MRI will be made available electronically to readers upon request. While there were no lesions in medial temporal lobe structures, we sought confirmation of the integrity of these structures through volumetric analyses (Kidron et al. , 1997; Kohler et al. , 1998) . This was accomplished by computing the volumes of the left and right hippocampi, parahippocampal gyri and amygdalae by planometric tracing of coronal slices on MRI, and comparing these volumes with those from an age-matched (33-year-old) healthy control subject. As seen in Fig. 2, the volumes of M. L. s medial temporal lobe structures are normal. PET Behavioral data Performance on the PET cued-recall task for healthy control subjects (from S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) , TBI control subjects and M. L. is summarized in Table 3. Performance was broadly consistent across subjects, suggesting that the task was within their abilities. In particular, it is noted that M. L. s performance was not impaired. In comparison with the healthy control subjects, the TBI control subjects showed a non-significant decline in recall during the retrieval scans. Imaging data In the earlier studies of the healthy subjects, a reading condition served as a baseline for encoding and retrieval (S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) . In the following analyses, encoding was used as a comparison for retrieval and vice versa. Before interpreting the results from patient MLL. and the TBI subjects, we verified that the pattern of activations previously reported for encoding and retrieval held when the data from healthy control subjects were re- analysed (with encoding and retrieval serving as comparisons for one another) . For the sake of comparison with the above analyses and completeness, we next report M. L. s encoding/retrieval differences. It is more appropriate, however, to analyse differences in M. L. s and healthy control subjects encoding/ Retrograde amnesia 1961 retrieval differences as interactions within a single design (Friston et al. , 1995) . These interactions, which indicate regions in which the pattern of M. L. s encoding/retrieval activations were statistically different from those of control subjects, are reported next. These are followed by replication of the critical findings with TBI control subjects. Finally, regions-of-interest analyses of the hippocampal activations are reported. Replication of previous results in healthy control subjects. Consistent with prior research (Tulving et al. , 1994; Nyberg et al. , 1996a) , encoding was associated with left frontal activation and retrieval was associated with right frontal activation (see Table 4) . In the encoding/retrieval comparison (Table 4, top) , the maximum of the left inferior frontal activation was within 10 mm of that reported for the encoding/reading comparison in the same subjects (S. Kapur et al. , 1996) . Also activated were lateral temporal regions bilaterally, right occipital and parahippocampal regions, the right cerebellum and the right inferior parietal lobe. In the retrieval/encoding comparison (Table 4, bottom) , the maximum of the right inferior frontal activation was also within 10 mm of the previously reported peak (Cabeza et al. , 1997) . Additionally, we found a large right superior frontal/ anterior cingulate activation. The thalamic, striatal and brainstem activations found here were also noted in the earlier report, although our striatal findings were on the left, whereas the previous ones were on the right. In contrast to the previous report, our retrieval/encoding comparison yielded right temporal-parietal, left insular and posterior cingulate activations. The correspondence of these findings with those reported previously (S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) indicates that it is reasonable to predict the HERA pattern when encoding and retrieval are used as comparisons for one another. Encoding/retrieval differences for patient MLL. MLL. s encoding/retrieval activations were similar to those of control subjects, although more posterior (see Table 5, top) . Left anterior activations were found in the precentral/ postcentral gyri and the insular cortex. Right occipital and cerebellar activations were noted, as was a small left middle temporal gyrus activation. In contrast to the healthy control subjects pattern of right lateralized retrieval/encoding activations (see Table 4, bottom) , M. L. s retrieval/encoding activations were left- lateralized (see Table 5, bottom) . Although there were small right inferior frontal activations, the most prominent activations were in the left cuneus, the left cerebellum and the left anterior cingulate gyrus. Qualitative comparison of healthy control subjects and MLL. s encoding/retrieval differences (i. e. comparison of Tables 4 and 5) suggests that the expected frontal hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry is attenuated in M. L. As noted above, however, this comparison is more appropriately addressed through statistical analysis of interactions between 1962 B. Levine et al. Patient M. L.

Interactions between M. L. and healthy control subjects. The observation of altered frontal asymmetry was reinforced by the results of the interaction analyses (Table 6) . In two right middle frontal gyrus regions, the right anterior cingulate and the left caudate, M. L. showed less activation in retrieval than in encoding (see Table 6, top) . In a left- lateralized medial/inferior temporal system including the hippocampus and the lingual gyrus, M. L. showed greater activation in retrieval than in encoding. The left and right cunei, and right superior temporal gyrus were also included (see Table 6, bottom) . Healthy control subjects showed the opposite pattern: greater right frontal activations in retrieval than in encoding and less left inferomedial temporal activation in retrieval than in encoding. Replication with TBI control subjects. The above interaction analyses were consistent with our hypotheses of reduced right frontal functioning and increased left medial temporal functioning during retrieval in M. L. However, because TBI affects systems mediating mnemonic processes, it is possible that these findings are not specific to M. L. ; they may be more generalized manifestations of TBI. Therefore, we sought to replicate the critical right frontal and left hippocampal findings by conducting interaction analyses in which M. L. s encoding/retrieval differences were statistically compared with those of TBI control subjects (without isolated retrograde amnesia) who were carefully matched to M. L. for background characteristics and injury severity. As seen in Fig. 3, the results of these analyses provided urther support for our hypotheses. The upper right portion of Fig. 3 shows a right frontal area of interaction (in Talairach space: x = 34, y = 56, z = 12) in which MLL. showed less activation in retrieval than in encoding (Z = 3. 24) .

Regions-of-interest analyses. To verify that the hippocampal findings could not be accounted for by an artefact due to spatial transformation, we analysed global mean adjusted PET counts taken from hippocampal regions of interest anatomically defined on the MRIs of M. L. and TBI control subjects. Consistent with the above findings, 1964 B. Levine et al.

The right side of the brain is depicted on the right side of the image. The coordinates of maxima in standard space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) are x = 34, y = 56, z = 12 (right frontal) and x = -30, y = -20, z = -12 (left hippocampal) . For the right frontal interaction, Z = 3. 24. For the left hippocampal interaction, Z = 3. 53. MLL. showed greater left hippocampal rCBF in retrieval than in encoding. The global mean adjusted PET counts were 0. 96 + 0. 024 (SEM) and 1. 0 + 0. 017 for encoding and retrieval, respectively, whereas TBI control subjects showed the opposite pattern: 1. 05 + 0. 031 and 1. 0 + 0. 033. The reliability of these differences was supported by a significant interaction between group (M. L. versus TBI control subjects) and condition (encoding versus retrieval) [F (1, 3) = 29. 36, P < 0. 05] for left hippocampal global-mean-adjusted PET counts. For the right hippocampus, the group X condition interaction was not significant, but the main effect of group was significant, with M. L. s right hippocampus significantly less activated than the TBI control subjects right hippocampi, in both encoding and retrieval conditions [global-mean- adjusted PET counts (+ SEM) for M. L. s right hippocampus 0. 95 + 0. 029, and for control subjects, 1. 06 + 0. 011; F (1, 3) = 14. 88, P < 0. 05], suggesting that M. L. s right hippocampus was not as responsive to the demands of the mnemonic tasks as the right hippocampi of the TBI control subjects. Remember/know judgements Results from the cued recall, recognition and remember/ know assessments are presented in Tables 7 and 8. For the sake of simplicity, only data from the first and fourth of the four recall tests are presented. Data from the two intervening tests were consistent with these data. M. L. s cued recall and recognition performance was not impaired relative to that of TBI control subjects (see Table 7) . At 24 h, his cued recall was relatively high, whereas recognition performance was at or near ceiling for all patients including M. L. At 2 weeks, cued recall dropped substantially for all subjects. Recognition hits were elevated for TBI control subjects, but this was attributable to a positive response bias, as seen in high false alarm rates. This bias was induced by a combination of the long delay interval, repeated and lengthy test sessions, invariance in item format and some overlapping themes across items. Correction for this bias (hits false alarms) reveals that M. L. s recognition accuracy was similar to that of TBI control subjects. The cued recall and recognition results were consistent with standard neuropsychological test results showing M. L. s Retrograde amnesia 1965 Table 7 Recall and recognition performance for TBI control subjects and M. L.

However, the R/K data suggest that the processes mediating this intact performance in ML. differ from those in control subjects. As seen in Table 8, M. L. s ability to re-experience the encoding episode (R responses) is significantly impoverished relative to that of control subjects. At 24 h, TBI subjects reported re-experiencing some aspect of the encoding episode for nearly all items they recognized as old, whereas M. L. did so for less than half of the items, a difference of ~7 SD. At 2 weeks, R responses declined for all subjects (see Table 8) , a pattern similar to that reported by others (Tulving, 1985; Gardiner, 1988; Gardiner and Java, 1991; Knowlton and Squire, 1995) . M. L. s R responses declined at a similar rate to those of TBI control subjects over the two week period. Therefore, within the constraints of our 24 h to 2 week interval, there is no evidence of accelerated forgetting, either for overall recognition or for R responses; M. L. s deficit in R responses was consistent across testing sessions. Additional testing at shorter delay intervals would be necessary to determine the rate of earlier decline in R responses, if any. M. L. showed more K responses than TBI control subjects at both 24 h and 2 weeks (see Table 8) . At 24 h, however, there was no opportunity for K responses in TBI control subjects because their R responses were at ceiling (R and K responses are, by definition, mutually exclusive) . At 2 weeks, when M. L. s advantage for K responses was reduced, TBI control subjects showed a positive response bias in which both targets and distracters were called old. Such false recognition responses should not be accompanied by R responses (Gardiner and Java, 1991; Rajaram, 1993) and were accordingly labelled K by TBI control subjects. M. L. did not show this bias. Therefore, K responses in TBI control subjects were suppressed at 24 h due to R ceiling effects and elevated at 2 weeks due to a positive response bias. The only interpretation that is clear from these data is that M. L. s noetic awareness (indexed by K responses) is not significantly impaired relative to TBI control subjects. On the other hand, autonoetic awareness (indexed by R responses) is impaired. Discussion Evidence from structural and functional neuroimaging and cognitive testing converged to support our hypotheses concerning the neuroanatomical and __ psychological underpinnings of M. L. s isolated retrograde amnesia. Structural neuroimaging revealed right ventral frontal cortical and subcortical damage, including damage to fibres in the uncinate fasciculus, suggesting an association between right frontalttemporal disconnection and isolated retrograde amnesia. Reports from M. L. and other patients with isolated retrograde amnesia suggest that episodic memory dysfunction may extend to anterograde tasks, even though standard memory tests are not always sensitive to this dysfunction. The activation PET study, which showed right frontal 1966 B. Levine et al. hypoactivation and left inferomedial temporal/hippocampal hyperactivation associated with anterograde retrieval, provided empirical support for these claims as well as a potential solution to the paradox of intact anterograde mnemonic processes with impaired retrieval of pre-injury experiences in isolated retrograde amnesia. Finally, M. L. demonstrated marked episodic impairment in comparison with carefully matched control subjects upon specific probing with the R/K technique. Taken together, the findings correspond to impoverished autonoetic awareness in M. L. Right frontotemporal disconnection in isolated retrograde amnesia There is now substantial evidence for the preferential role of the right prefrontal cortex in episodic memory. The HERA pattern, in which right prefrontal activation is associated with episodic retrieval and left prefrontal activation is associated with episodic encoding and semantic retrieval (Tulving et al. , 1994) , is one of the most robust findings in functional neuroimaging of cognition, replicated with a variety of stimuli in several laboratories (for reviews, see Nyberg et al. , 1996a; Fletcher et al. , 1997) . While this pattern was not predicted on the basis of lesion studies, right frontal lesions are associated with deficits on retrieval tasks in which monitoring, verification and placement of information in temporal and spatial contexts are of critical importance (Milner et al. , 1985; Stuss et al. , 1994a) . Reduplication, confabulation and false recognition, all disorders of faulty episodic retrieval, are associated with right frontal lesions (Stuss et al. , 1978; Baddeley and Wilson, 1986; Hakim et al. , 1988; N. Kapur et al. , 1988; Schacter et al. , 1996b) . The prefrontal cortex, however, does not operate in isolation. The anterior temporal, insular and ventral frontal cortex emerge from a single palaeocortical moiety originating in the olfactory cortex (Sanides, 1970; Pandya and Barnes, 1987; Pandya and Yeterian, 1996) . Direct, reciprocal information transfer between these regions is mediated by the uncinate fasciculus (see Fig. 1) , providing the frontal temporal connectivity necessary for the monitoring and contextualization of temporal lobe output within the framework of one s past experience (Moscovitch, 1992) . Based on HERA, the dominance of the right hemisphere in imagery and emotional processing and the presence of isolated retrograde amnesia following right frontal-temporal pathology, the right uncinate fasciculus has been proposed as being preferentially involved in retrieval of episodic autobiographical information (Markowitsch, 1995) . The other lesions noted on M. L. s MRI could not account for his isolated retrograde amnesia. Occipital lesions, which MLL. had, have been associated with isolated retrograde amnesia (O Connor et al. , 1992; Ogden, 1993; Hunkin et al. , 1995) , but these patients had large cortical lesions in comparison with M. L. s small haemosiderin deposits. An earlier isolated retrograde amnesia case (Goldberg et al. , 1981) had damage in the ventral tegmentum. In our case, ventral tegmental damage may have occurred as a result of midline pathology that also affected the hypothalamus, as suggested by M. L. s hunger and thirst insensitivity, but there was no evidence of this on MRI. M. L. s bilateral superior frontal lesions were small and located in posterior frontal regions, near the parietal frontal junction. These lesions may affect lower extremity motor and sensory functioning (present in MLL. in the right knee) , but there is no a priori basis for predicting an effect of these lesions on memory functioning. While the presence of undetected focal pathology is always an issue in severe TBI, we note that the right ventral frontal lesions represented the most significant structural pathology in ML. (with imaging techniques that are highly sensitive to TBl-related damage) . The lesion location is remarkably consistent with Markowitsch s (1995) uncinate hypothesis, and the coordinates of the lesion are within the right frontotemporal network described by Fink et al. (1996) activated in response to retrieval of personal past memories as measured by PET. While we agree that multifocal damage is a necessary precipitant to isolated retrograde amnesia (N. Kapur et al. , 1996) , we consider the right ventral frontal focal damage (which is itself multifocal) to be of critical importance to M. L. s isolated retrograde amnesia. This hypothesis was supported by PET analysis of the functional consequences of his frontotemporal disconnection. The functional neuroanatomy of preserved anterograde memory in isolated retrograde amnesia MLL. showed right frontal hypoactivation relative to control subjects as measured by H, ! O PET during cued recall using a previously validated PET paradigm (S. Kapur et al. , 1996; Cabeza et al. , 1997) . The focus of M. L. s right frontal hypoactivation during retrieval was in the same location no matter which control group was used for comparison. It was in stark contrast with the expected pattern of increased right frontal rCBF in retrieval relative to encoding, a pattern that is, if anything, accentuated in TBI control subjects (see Fig. 3) . The focus was in right frontal area 10, an area undercut by MLL. s lesion that has been identified as part of the episodic retrieval system (Tulving et al. , 1994; Buckner, 1996; Nyberg et al. , 1996a) . This system is impoverished in MLL. , affecting his ability to re-experience episodes from his personal past that occurred in a specific time and place (including his post-injury past) . Although right frontal retrieval-related deactivation would also be consistent with the PET findings, this would require a more complex explanation involving active inhibitory processes during retrieval. If there was deactivation, however, this would not change the overall interpretation of altered right frontal functioning associated with retrieval. Hypoactivation directly in M. L. s lesioned area was not predicted, as this area is largely located in white matter, and the size of the cortical injuries are below the spatial resolution of H) ! O PET. M. L. s spared performance on the cued-recall task used in the PET study (i. e. the retrieval condition) was associated with increased activation in an intact left inferomedial temporal lobe system, a finding in accord with recent evidence of functional reorganization following focal brain injury (Heiss et al. , 1993; Engelien et al. , 1995; Weiller et al. , 1995; Buckner et al. , 1996) . In healthy adults, the medial temporal lobe memory system is reflexively engaged by retrieval success (Moscovitch, 1992; Grasby et al. , 1993; Nyberg et al. , 1996b; Schacter et al. , 1996a; Rugg et al. , 1997) . In M. L. , this system supports performance on tests of anterograde memory, but retrieval of pre-injury autobio- graphical episodes, initially processed by the right frontotemporal system, cannot be achieved through this system. Our findings contrast with the early activation rCBF study of Wood et al. (1980a) , where anterograde retrieval in a patient with temporally-graded isolated retrograde amnesia and left hippocampal damage was associated with preserved right hippocampal function. The two studies are consistent, however, in showing that retrieval of recently learned verbal information can be mediated by the homologous (right or left) preserved frontotemporal system. These functional neuroimaging data provide support for the proposal that anterograde learning in isolated retrograde amnesia is supported by reliance on preserved pathways, but that these pathways cannot provide access to pre-injury information (Hodges and McCarthy, 1993; Markowitsch, 1995; N. Kapur et al. , 1996) . In interpreting both the left hippocampal temporal and right frontal PET findings, we emphasize changes associated ith retrieval in comparison with encoding. From the PET data alone, however, encoding changes cannot be ruled out. In other words, encoding/retrieval differences in activation can reflect changes in association with encoding, retrieval or both. However, assuming M. L. s encoding processes operated efficiently prior to his injury, his primary deficit is greater for retrieval than for encoding. Considering M. L. s good performance, encoding-related left hippocampal deactivation involving active inhibition is unlikely. The demands of the encoding condition are similar to those of baseline scans used in other studies of this sort that are designed to ensure deep processing (e. g. S. Kapur et al. , 1994) . In this sense, the encoding condition can be viewed as a conservative match to the processing demands of the retrieval condition. It is tempting to interpret M. L. s overall right hippocampal hypoactivation (in the region-of-interest analyses) as a sign of right frontal-temporal disconnection affecting the rCBF responses to both encoding and retrieval demands. However, there was neither structural damage in the right hippocampus nor evidence of hippocampal hypoperfusion in the resting FDG PET study. More sensitive imaging techniques could potentially reveal right hippocampal damage. Firm conclusions concerning this finding should wait until these techniques become available. z Retrograde amnesia 1967 Memory test performance spared remember - ing impaired M. L. s performance on most neuropsychological tests was normal. Most notably, his performance on standard clinical and experimental measures of recall and recognition tasks was normal. There is now substantial evidence that two memory systems (episodic and semantic) , each corresponding to a different level of awareness (autonoetic and noetic) , contribute to performance on these tests, and that the R/K technique is a valid way to dissociate these systems (Tulving, 1985, 1989; Gardiner, 1988; Wheeler et al. , 1997) . In accord with our hypothesis of deficient autonoetic awareness in M. L. , his R responses were consistently low, indicating that he achieved normal performance without re- experiencing the encoding episode to the same extent as the TBI control subjects. The neural correlates of M. L. s R/K performance cannot be precisely determined without functional neuroimaging concurrent with R/K testing. Although PET does not have the temporal resolution necessary for such item-by-item analyses, event related potential (ERP) studies are instructive in this regard. R responses have been consistently associated with a late frontal positivity (Smith, 1993; Mangels et al. , 1996b; Diizel et al. , 1997; Rugg et al. , 1998) . Tasks of source recall also assess recollection of encoding characteristics, they are associated with frontal function (Schacter et al. , 1984; Shimamura and Squire, 1987; Janowsky et al. , 1989) , have the same ERP signature as R responses (Rugg et al. , 1998) and can be considered measures of autonoetic awareness (Tulving, 1989; Wheeler et al. , 1997) . ERP studies of source recall have consistently documented late right frontal positivity associated with analysis of contextual information from the encoding episode (Wilding et al. , 1995; Wilding and Rugg, 1996, 1997; Johnson et al. , 1996) . These ERP analyses of R responses and source recall support the association of autonoetic awareness with right frontal functioning. This research, in combination with our MRI and PET findings, suggests that M. L. s R deficiency (and impaired autonoetic awareness) is attributable to right frontal dysfunction. One question raised by the R/K data concerns M. L. s increased K responses in comparison with TBI control subjects. This finding could be interpreted as evidence either for a hyperactivated left hemispheric semantic system or for a normal semantic system responding in the absence of episodic recollection. While the large retrieval encoding left inferomedial temporal activation in M. L. could be viewed as consistent with the former hypothesis, Knowlton and Squire (1995) showed that, in healthy adults, R responses convert to K responses as episodic recollection declines over long delays. In other words, elevated K responses could simply reflect the absence of episodic recollection, rather than facilitated semantic processes. As the PET study was conducted on separate stimuli, we prefer the conservative interpretation of M. L. s elevated K responses as evincing unimpaired (but not necessarily facilitated) noetic awareness. 1968 B. Levine et al. Most importantly, consistent with M. L. s reports of his own recollections of post-injury events, the information presumably retrieved via this system lacks the subjective quality characteristic of normal episodic recall of events integrated within the fabric of one s self and one s past. Episodic memory, self-regulation and self scotomata Remembering episodes from one s personal past is not possible in the absence of autonoetic awareness. The role of autonoetic awareness in human behaviour, however, is not limited to recollecting past episodes; it is relevant across the time dimension, encompassing both reflection on the past and projection into the future (Ingvar, 1985; Fuster, 1995; Wheeler et al. , 1997; Stuss et al. , 1998) . In unstructured situations, autonoetic awareness supports the formulation of goals and implementation of a behavioural guidance system to achieve them. In patients deprived of this capacity, behaviour is driven by irrelevant environmental goals, or inappropriate habits or routines (Shallice and Burgess, 1993) , a syndrome that we refer to as self-regulatory disorder. Therefore, patients with impaired autonoetic awareness should have impaired self-regulation as well as impaired episodic memory. Thus far, we have supported our hypothesis of impaired autonoetic awareness in M. L. through analyses of his episodic memory functioning. The only other task on which M. L. was significantly impaired was a strategy application task designed to tap self-regulatory disorder by minimizing environmental or internal constraints typical of most neuropsychological tests (Levine et al. , 1998; M. L. s data were included with the TBI subjects in that study) . Performance on this test was shown to be sensitive to TBI and right ventral frontal pathology (Levine et al. , 1998) . We propose that M. L. s impaired self-regulation (both inside and outside the laboratory) and his mnemonic deficits can be unified within the concept of impaired autonoetic awareness that affects behaviour across the time dimension. His behaviour is driven by generic information that he has learned about how one should behave, rather than by goals and intentions that arise from his own identity. The time course of his behavioural deficits is consistent with this hypothesis. His self-regulatory disorder was initially quite severe, exemplified by a number of parenting mishaps, such as letting his children play in dangerous situations. This was followed by an attenuation of the disorder with learning over time. Nevertheless, even at 5 years post-injury M. L. s interpersonal interactions appear somewhat contrived and artificial. One might ask why M. L. s profile of deficits is not more commonly observed in other patients, in particular in patients with TBI and/or right ventral frontal lesions. In fact, TBI patients do have self-regulatory deficits that have profound effects on their behaviour in occupational and interpersonal situations (Lishman, 1973; Jennett and Bond, 1975; Dikmen and Temkin, 1987; Dikmen et al. , 1995) . The relationship between focal ventral frontal pathology and impaired self- regulation is also apparent in studies using tasks designed to mimic the ambiguity inherent in real-life situations (Lhermitte et al. , 1986; Shallice and Burgess, 1991; Rolls et al. , 1994; Bechara et al. , 1996; Burgess and Shallice, 1996) and in case studies of impaired real-life self-regulation (Harlow, 1868; Eslinger and Damasio, 1985) . Furthermore, disorders such as subarachnoid haemorrhage from anterior communicating artery aneurysms and frontotemporal dementia both involve ventral pathology and result in impaired self-regulation (as defined by specialized tests or grossly impaired real-life self- regulation; see the Lund and Manchester Groups, 1993; Miller et al. , 1993; Alexander and Freedman, 1984) . While patients in these studies typically have bilateral lesions, many of these studies specifically emphasize right ventral frontal pathology. From these observations, self-regulatory disorder, one manifestation of impaired autonoetic awareness, can be caused by ventral frontal pathology, especially in the right hemisphere. Goldman-Rakic and colleagues (e. g. Funahashi et al. , 1993) characterized topographically organized spatial working memory deficits in monkeys with principal sulcus lesions as mnemonic scotomata. This concept provides a potential mechanism for impaired autonoetic awareness and its behavioural manifestation as impaired self-regulation. That is, in healthy adults, referral to the self, defined here as a multimodal distributed network of associations accrued over a lifetime of experiences, gives rise to autonoetic awareness, which in turn supports the formulation of future goals, especially in unstructured situations where the goal cannot be derived from the environment or habit. Brain damage can cause mnemonic scotomata for information contained in this network, especially damage to regions important to the indexing or triggering of recollection of personal past events (i. e. anterior temporal lobes or frontal lobes) , resulting in a failure of analysis or on-line maintenance of information concerning the self (or some aspect of it) as a continuous entity across time. Dense anterograde and retrograde amnesia can be viewed as an exemplar of this syndrome, as illustrated by the following passage from Tulving (1985) describing densely amnesic patient K. C. (referred to as N. N. in that paper) . [When asked, on different occasions, to describe the blankness that characterizes his state of mind when he tries to think about tomorrow, he says that it is like being asleep or that it s a big blankness sort of thing. When asked to give an analogy, to describe what it is like, he says, It s like being in a room with nothing there and having a guy tell you to go find a chair, and there s nothing there. (p. 4) . ] It has been argued that K. C. has no autonoetic awareness (Tulving, 1985) . Even though he can describe his own personality traits when directly queried (Tulving, 1993) , he cannot spontaneously hold self-specific information on-line, integrate it with mental representations of the past and future, or use it to drive his behaviour towards personally relevant goals. M. L. most probably retains some residual autonoetic awareness, but it only operates on post-injury information, and even there less efficiently than control subjects. Other TBI patients and other patients with ventral frontal pathology may have more subtle autonoetic deficits, although evidence of this with respect to past or future events is not probed for in routine exams (Goldberg and Bilder, 1986) . Furthermore, patients are not likely to register such complaints when semantic knowledge of their personal past is intact (Stuss et al. , 1998) , although they may describe personality change. Conclusions Taken together, the structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging and cognitive psychological findings converge on the hypotheses that M. L. s clinical syndrome of isolated retrograde amnesia is related to a right frontal lesion affecting his ability to re-experience past experiences, and that this effect extends across the time continuum into anterograde learning and self-regulation of behaviour. While the results from a single case must always be interpreted with caution, the evidence presented and reviewed herein shows that brain damage affects autonoetic awareness, and that this effect can be observed through patients behaviour with respect to their own pasts and futures.

        "other": ", 1992; Calabrese et al. , 1996; Mattioli et al. , 1996) . However, these patients semantic knowledge, especially factual knowledge pertaining to their own past, can be improved through re- exposure to the information (O Connor et al. , 1992; De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993; Brown and Chobor, 1995; Hokkanen et al. , 1995; N. Kapur et al. , 1996; Kroll et al. , 1997) . Episodic impairment (i. e. inability to recollect past episodes from a specific place and time prior to the injury) , although harder to quantify, is more prominently impaired in isolated retrograde amnesia patients, and is more resistant to improvement. Even when patients learn and retain information about personal past events, they consistently report an inability to re-experience these events as part of their own subjective past; the events may just as well have happened to someone else (Goldberg et al. , 1981; N. Kapur et al. , 1992, 1996; De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993; De Renzi et al. , 1995; Hunkin et al. , 1995; Mattioli et al. , 1996; Kroll et al. , 1997) . Similar qualitative reports are noted for amnesic patients with combined anterograde and retrograde deficits (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Tulving et al. , 1988; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) . Given the relatively selective nature of episodic memory impairment in isolated retrograde amnesia, these cases provide a unique opportunity to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of episodic memory dysfunction. Retrograde amnesia 1953 In this paper, we report findings from evidence in favour of hemispheric specificity of anterior temporal functional representation of remote memory (Kopelman, 1993) . Patients with left anterior temporal lesions have impaired knowledge of historical events, famous faces and other semantic information (De Renzi et al. , 1987; Barr et al. , 1990; Tranel, 1991; Leplow et al. , 1997) , whereas many patients with retrograde amnesia for episodic autobiographical information have anterior temporal damage that is right-lateralized, or bilateral with more damage on the right (N. Kapur et al. , 1992; O Connor Fig. 1 M. L. s right inferior frontal lesions appear as three hypointensities on T- and T; -weighted MRI. Each lesion is depicted in three planes, each lesion marked with a different sized arrow. (A) Oblique coronal slices through the lesioned area. The T-weighted image is on the left, and the T, -weighted image (reconstructed from axial slices) is on the right. The angle of the slices (35 from the coronal plane perpendicular to the AC PC line) is shown in the small schematic diagram. (B) Axial T, -weighted images. The right side of the brain is depicted on the left side of the image. Numbers indicate Brodmann areas. The measurements below each image give the distance in millimetres from the AC-PC line. (C) Sagittal views through the lesioned area. The upper two figures are T, -weighted images, and the lower left figure is a T, -weighted image (reconstructed from axial slices and through the same plane as the upper right figure) . In the lower right is a depiction of white matter pathways, including the uncinate fasciculus, illustrated on the lateral cortical surface, from D j rine (1895) , Vol. 1, p. 757. The figure has been reversed from the original to correspond to the right hemisphere. 1954 B. Levine et al. et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993b; Calabrese et al. , 1996; Kroll et al. , 1997) . The presence of frontal damage in cases of isolated retrograde amnesia (O Connor et al. , 1992; Markowitsch et al. , 1993a; Brown and Chobor, 1995; Calabrese et al. , 1996; Kroll et al. , 1997) is consistent with the involvement of the frontal lobes in the performance on memory tasks that stress strategic processing of contextual information (Schacter, 1987; Petrides, 1989; Stuss et al. , 1994b) , including tasks of remote memory (Kopelman, 1991; Della Sala et al. , 1993; Mangels et al. , 1996a) . Furthermore, the right fronta involvement in these cases would be predicted by functional neuroimaging evidence of preferential involvement of the right prefrontal cortex in episodic retrieval (for reviews, see Nyberg et al. , 1996a; Fletcher et al. , 1997) . The presence o: anterior temporal pathology in most of these cases, however, suggests that frontal pathology is not sufficient to cause isolated retrograde amnesia. It is more likely that disrupte frontal-temporal interaction is involved, a hypothesis supported by a H, !5O PET study in which recollection o episodes from healthy subjects personal past was specifically associated with right anterior temporal, insular and ventral frontal activation (Fink et al. , 1996; see also Tulving, 1989; Andreasen et al. , 1995) . The uncinate fasciculus (Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992) (see Fig. 1) , providing a direct, reciprocal anterior-temporal inferior-frontal connection, is considered critical to this process (Markowitsch, 1995) . Several researchers have suggested an association between retrograde amnesia and damage to posterior regions, including inferior temporal, parietal and occipital regions (O Connor et al. , 1992; Ogden, 1993; Hunkin et al. , 1995; Eslinger et al. , 1996) . These findings have been interpreted within a framework of interaction between primary, first-order and higher-order association cortices advanced by Damasio (1989) . This theory states that recollection requires a pattern of firing similar to that which occurred when an event was originally perceived. Damage to posterior regions could disrupt unimodal input (e. g. a visual image) to convergence zones (association areas) , interrupting networks of activation normally involved in recollection (Ogden, 1993) . Preserved anterograde mnemonic functioning in isolated retrograde amnesia A second major issue in isolated retrograde amnesia is the apparent paradox that processes operating successfully on retrieval of newly learned information cannot be used to retrieve information pre-dating the injury. It is unlikely that nature would evolve separate systems for long-term retrieval that are differentially affected by neurological disease: one that operates on post-injury information and another on pre- injury information. Rather, recovery from brain injury most probably involves functional reorganization in which were supplemented with tests at delay intervals of up to 6 weeks (O Connor et al. , 1992; De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993; Maravita et al. , 1995; N. Kapur et al. , 996) . In each case, there was disproportionate impairment at the longer delay intervals relative to performance at the standard delay intervals, suggesting a process of accelerated orgetting that was not detected by the standard tests. If anterograde mnemonic processes are impaired in isolated retrograde amnesia, then how do isolated retrograde amnesia patients perform standardized episodic memory tests? The explanation may lie in the multifactorial nature of these tests. In healthy adults, both episodic and non-episodic mnemonic systems contribute to test performance. Chief among the non-episodic systems is semantic memory, although other non-conscious systems can be involved (e. g. perceptual priming and procedural memory) . In patients with isolated retrograde amnesia and impaired episodic memory, performance can still be achieved through semantic or other non-episodic processes. While these different processes cannot be directly assessed through behaviour, their contribution to test performance can be estimated with the remember/know (R/K) technique (Tulving, 1985; Gardiner, 1988) . This technique can be applied to any memory test. Each time an item from a previously studied list is recalled or recognized, subjects classify the item as R or K according to their subjective mnemonic experience associated with the item. R responses are assigned to items that are associated with episodic recollection of an aspect of the encoding episode (e. g. something they thought about, saw or heard when the item was presented) . Items recalled or recognized without recollection of something specific from the encoding episode are classified as K . As R responses correspond to re-experiencing aspects of the encoding episode, they provide a more specific measure of episodic memory than do simple recall or recognition. Consistent with the hypothesized relationship between the frontal lobes and episodic memory (Tulving, 1985; Stuss, 1991b; Wheeler et al. , 1997; Stuss et al. , 1998) , R responses are specifically associated with frontal lobe functioning (Parkin and Walter, 1992; Diizel et al. , 1997) . In individuals with frontal pathology and impoverished episodic memory, normal test performance may be attained on the basis of intact semantic memory or other non-episodic processes, without the phenomenal experience of remembering (Tulving, 1985; see also Parkin and Walter, 1992; Huron et al. , 1995) . This reliance on non-episodic processes could account for the relatively preserved anterograde learning in patients with isolated retrograde amnesia and would predict that these patients experience a lack of subjective connection to the products of their anterograde learning. Episodic memory entails autonoetic ( self-knowing ) awareness, i. e. the awareness of oneself as a continuous entity across time (Tulving, 1985) . With regard to past experiences, autonoetic awareness facilitates the knowledge that the self doing the experiencing now is the same self that did so at an earlier time (Wheeler et al. , 1997: p. 349) ; it allows one to mentally travel 1997; Kohler et al. , 1998) . The regions of interest were transferred to the axial PET images, which had been co-registered to the MRIs (resliced into 57 slices parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus) and averaged for encoding and retrieval. PET counts were taken from the five slices in each subject on which anterior, middle and posterior portions of the hippocampal regions of interest were represented. The data were normalized by dividing by the mean global blood flow for all brain slices. Two analyses of variance (one for the left hippocampus and one for the right hippocampus) were conducted, each with group (M. L. versus TBI control subjects) , condition (encoding versus retrieval) , subject and slice as factors; condition and slice were treated as repeated measures. The critical effect in these analyses was the interaction between group and condition, indicating different patterns of encoding-retrieval activations in M. L. versus TBI control subjects. Remember/know judgements M. L. s anterograde mnemonic processes were probed with a cued recall and recognition test supplemented by remember/ know (R/K) judgements (Tulving, 1985) . To assess changes in forgetting rates, recall and recognition testing were conducted in four test sessions spanning 2 weeks from the encoding session. A pool of 264 amusing definitions of single- meaning words (e. g. A talkative featherbrain parakeet ; Tulving and Watkins, 1977; Donnelly, 1988) provided stimuli with high associative value that could be retained over the 2 week interval. Half (132) of these served as targets, and half as distracters. In the encoding session, the target definitions were read aloud twice by the examiner. To promote deep encoding, subjects indicated whether or not each definition made sense to them. Targets and distracters were randomly assigned to one of four test sessions such that each session employed a list of 66 randomized targets and distracters (33 each) . Although these tests were rather lengthy, the extra items increased reliability for the small group study. Test sessions were conducted over the phone at 24 h, 72 h, and 1 week and 2 weeks post-encoding. For each definition, the first part (e. g. A talkative featherbrain ) was read aloud by the examiner. If the subject completed the definition correctly, credit was assigned for cued recall. If the subject did not correctly complete the definition, the examiner read the second part, and recognition was assessed through subjects judgements of definitions as old (a target definition from the encoding session) or new (a distracter) . Target definitions that were completed by the subject in cued recall were automatically designated as correctly recognized. (It was nearly impossible for subjects to guess the answer to distracter definitions without having heard them before. False recognition of a distracter, however, was quite common among TBI control subjects. These responses were tallied for the purposes of computing recognition accuracy. ) Prior to testing, the R/K distinction was introduced to subjects. The instructions stressed two types of memory. The first type, corresponding to remember judgements, is marked by re-experiencing some aspect of the encoding episode (e. g. the examiner s voice or a mental association the subject might have made upon hearing the definition) . The second type, corresponding to know judgements, pertains to familiarity of the definition as old, but without recollection of any aspect of the encoding episode. To avoid the confusion inherent in the terms remember and know the two types of memory were designated as memory type A and B. Therefore, after each item judged as old, subjects indicated whether or not they could mentally re-experience the encoding episode by classifying it as memory type A or memory type B. To ensure that subjects understood the distinction, they were intermittently asked to explain why they made their designations. All subjects gave informed consent. The studies were approved by the ethics committee of Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care and a University of Toronto committee. Results MRI A cluster of hypointensities in the right ventral frontal cortex and white matter was visible on both the T, - and T, -weighted images (see Fig. 1) . The presence of hypointensities on the T, -weighted images indicates actual loss of brain tissue, as opposed to just the presence of haemosiderin deduced from T, -weighted images. Two hypointensities were at the ventrolateral cortical surface of the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 47) and extended into white matter. The third was in white matter deep to frontal cortex.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Keywords: Fornix, memory, str Dear Editor, We present the case of a patient with an isolated infarction of the fornix, with a neuropsychological follow-up of 12 months. This case provides interesting insight about the cognitive deficits associated with isolated damage to this structure and its correlation with underlying fibre tract changes. . The fornix is an association pathway of the limbic system [1]. It is an important structure for consolidation of data into long term memory, connecting the temporal lobe to diencephalic structures [1, 2]. It also mediates connections to prefrontal lobe directly by a superior dorsal branch or indirectly through the Papez circuit [3, 4]. Damage to this structure has been reported to cause diverse cognitive symptoms, including anterograde amnesia with verbal and visual memory deficits, psychomotor slowing, personality changes, dysexecutive syndrome, and retrograde amnesia [5]. Nevertheless, most commonly, these injuries do not concern the fornix exclusively and also involve other structures, namely the corpus callosum, septum pellucidum and adjacent fibre tracts [5-6]. A 68-year-old woman was submitted to an endovascular treatment. of an unruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (AcomA) . She had initially presented to the emergency department with epistaxis and a hypertensive crisis, and a brain CT scan showed a small, hyperdense, right frontal periventricular lesion, adjacent to the caudate nucleus. A brain CT angiography identified a sacular aneurysm of the AcoA. The patient was submitted to endovascular treatment, and twenty -four hours after the procedure, presented with topographic disorientation, and a repetitive, digressive speech with recurrent temporal confabulations related with two past events of a christening and a funeral ceremonies, with thorough description of family members and their conversations, as if they were happening at that moment. Brain MRI showed an acute infarction of both anterior pillars of the fornix, (figure 1A) . Confabulations resolved after 24h but the neuropsychological evaluation 72 hours later documented a severe anterograde memory deficit, involving verbal and visual material, with a profile suggesting a predominant impairment in the retrieval phase (figure 1C) . Considerable topographic anterograde amnesia was also observed. The patient was unable to learn trajectories in the Neurology ward, but recalled familiar routes without difficulty. Tests evaluating working, autobiographic, and remote semantic memory were unimpaired (figure 1C) . Six months later, the neuropsychological revaluation showed a significant improvement of these deficits. She maintained only mild difficulty of anterograde verbal memory (figure IC) . There were no topographic impairments in daily life. This improvement was sustained in the revaluation at 12 months. A diffusion tensor imaging study with tractography of the fornix was performed at day 3 and 6 months after the neurological symptoms, and showed an increase in the density of represented fibres on the location of the fornix comparing the first with the last exam (figure 1B) . This case allows to demonstrate, quite clearly, the functional contribution of the fornix to memory function. In fact, an isolated circumscribed fornix lesion produced acute anterograde amnesia with confabulation, and the restoration of signal integrity of the fornix fibres paralleled the improvement of memory. Isolated injury of the fornix is rarely described, with only 9 cases having been reported (Table e-1) . To our knowledge, only two cases with a similarly detailed cognitive follow-up have been reported, and in both of them the lesions involved other brain structures: the first case, concerning a patient with subarachnoid, intraventricular and intracerebral haemorrhages, with a 7-month follow-up [2], and the second case regarding a patient with an extensive lesion involving the right fornix, right orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior and middle frontal gyri, white matter of the corona radiata of the ipsilateral middle frontal lobe, and the right hypothalamic nuclei, with a 3 and 17-month follow-up [7]. In our case, the MRI showed an isolated anatomical lesion of the fornix. Therefore, we think it provides a rare opportunity to characterize the presentation and clinical course of the lesion concerning this structure without having any involvement of adjacent structures as a confounder. Anterograde topographical amnesia, which has been described after lesions of parahippocampal areas [8], was also observed in our patient, due to a temporary functional disconnection between hippocampal structures and diencephalon. Confabulation may have occurred due to the conjugation of memory deficits with a putative transitory prefrontal dysfunction, already resolved at the time of neuropsychological evaluation [9, 10]. A fornix injury is difficult to ascertain precisely through MRI, and most often involves adjacent structures and not the fornix exclusively. In our case, MRI diffusion-weighted imaging shows a well-defined lesion of the fornix, providing an uncontaminated characterisation of the patients deficits. Furthermore, follow- up of such cases through tractography images characterisation has also rarely been published in previous literature. Therefore, this case presents interesting clinico-anatomical data, about fornix fibres restoration and cognitive improvement. Table e-1.

However, nothing is known about its impact on the ability to mentally represent one's past and on personal identity. We addressed these questions in a case of chronic USN, DR, a 59-year-old right-handed woman, who underwent a variety of measures exploring the self and autobiographical memory (AM) . DR showed preserved self-images and her AM performance was only preserved when memories were prompted by her own self-images and not by self-unrelated cues. Our findings are discussed in light of the interconnection between the self and AM.

Supplemental data for this article can be accessed here : http: //www. tandfonline. com/doi/full/10. 1080/13554794. 2016. 1175634 Introduction The ability to remember one's past (i. e. , autobiographical memory; AM) is of fundamental importance for the experience of enduring as an individual to have a mental representation of the contralesional (left) side of space (Saj, Fuhrman, Vuilleumier, & Boroditsky, 2013) . Most patients show a rapid recovery of USN but, in rare cases, this syndrome persists and may be regarded as chronic (Stone, Patel, Greenwood, & Halligan, 1992) . While studies on USN generally focus on perception and attention, which are at the forefront of this Published in: Neurocase : Case Studies in Neuropsychology, Neuropsychiatry & Behavioural Neurology (2016) Status: Postprint (author's version) condition, one could reasonably expect that USN might impinge on AM. Indeed, since USN compromises both the perception and the mental representation of the environment, it is likely that the mental representations of the past will also be affected, especially since personal memories are characterized by their visual content (Conway, 2005) . In this vein, Saj et al. (2013) explored whether people with left USN would have difficulty representing events that fall to the left on the spatial representation of the mental time line, a hypothesis which was supported by their findings. However, this study did not focus on patients' personal memories per se but on the recall of past and future characteristics from a fictitious person. This led us to explore AM for the first time in USN, and specifically, how personal past events and the self are mentally represented in a single-case with chronic USN. Case report DR is a 59-year-old right-handed woman, who was working as an architect until she suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke in December 2013. She was under the care of a neurologist at the University Hospital of Dijon (France) and neuroimaging showed a right frontoparietal lesion (Figure 1) . Figure 1. DR's CT scan 15 days after her stroke (January 2014) showing right frontoparietal lesion traces (the right is on the left) . One month after her stroke, DR underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Scores obtained by DR compared to normative data for each test are summarized in Table 1. This neuropsychological assessment revealed a left USN, a left hemianesthesia and attentional disorders (i. e. , alertness, as measured by the alertness subtest from the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP 2. 2) . Her USN was mainly egocentric, with problems in the ability to detect and to take into consideration objects on the left side of space in the visual, auditory, and somesthetic modalities. At this stage, the neuropsychological examination also revealed mild impairment in executive function, specifically in verbal fluency (i. e. , a measure of executive control ability) , and DR also had borderline score for inhibition. Anterograde memory scores were also at the limit of the normal range but language and praxis were preserved. While DR had no particular subjective complaints, her husband had noticed occasional forgetting in daily life. After 24 weeks, only her attentional impairment and USN persisted, despite a slight improvement. Her USN was thus considered as chronic (note that her last follow-up examination conducted in June 2015 - i. e. , after the testing in this study was carried out - confirmed that her USN was still present) . In comparison, there is a relative preservation of her general cognitive functioning. The AM assessment described below was carried out 15 weeks after DR's stroke. Published in: Neurocase : Case Studies in Neuropsychology, Neuropsychiatry & Behavioural Neurology (2016) Status: Postprint (author's version) memory: test episodique de la m moire du pass autobiographique (TEMPau) To assess AM, DR underwent the TEMPau (Piolino, Desgranges, & Eustache, 2000) , which consists of generating a total of 24 specific memories across five lifetime periods (0-17 years old, 18-30 years old, more than 30 years old except the last 5 years, last 5 years except the last 12 months, and the last 12 months) and providing as many details as possible about the memories. For each life period (except the last year) , participants have to retrieve memories related to four generic cues (e. g. , relationships, school, work, travel) . For the last year period, eight generic cues are used (e. g. , last summer, last week, etc. ) using a chronological approach. While no practice session was conducted, examples of specific and non-specific memories were provided to ensure that DR understood this distinction. No time limit was set. Each memory is rated on a five-point scale (0 = absence of memory or general information to 4 = specific and richly detailed memory) . This included all the scores whatever their nature (max. 4x4 = 16) and also the strictly episodic score (i. e. , including only the specific detailed memories, that is memories rated as 4 (max. 4x4=16) . The TEMPau performance is summarized in Table 2. Crawford and Howell's method (1998) was applied for all the statistical comparisons. Compared to norms, DR obtained a lower overall AM mean. score and a lower strictly episodic mean score. For the overall AM score, this impairment seemed present for all the life periods, except for the last five years. For the strictly episodic score, of the 24 memories requested, DR only provided two episodic memories; the remaining were semantic in nature xamples of memories provided by DR during the TEMPau are available in Supplemental Data. | AM task To explore the relationship between AM and the self, we carried out the | AM task (Rathbone et al. , 2008) . In the absence of normative data for this test, DR performance was compared to those of 14 healthy controls (10 women) matched for age (mean: 65. 71; SD: 19. 55) . This test consists first in generating as many self-images as possible that are important in defining current identity (e. g. , |ama mother, | am shy) . Identity statements were scored using the modified coding scale from the twenty statements test (TST; Rhee, Uleman, Lee, & Roman, 1995) . Each statement was coded according to eight categories (e. g. , traits, social identities, physical descriptions, etc. ) and this allowed us to measure the complexity of identity (i. e. , the number of categories sampled in participants' responses) . Participants have to select the three most important or significant of their self-images and to provide for each one, three specific memories and to describe them in as many details as possible. To ensure understanding of instructions, examples of self-images and associated memories were provided to all participants. A similar procedure for the TEMPau was used to score these memories (i. e. , a five-point scale going from 0 = absence of memory or general information to 4 = specific and richly detailed memory) . A second rater scored 34% of the memories, showing strong inter-rater reliability (Kendall's correlation coefficient: 0. 85) . DR and healthy participants' scores are summarized in Table 2. Using the Crawford and Howell's method (1998) , we observed that DR provided a similar number of self-images as healthy participants, (examples of DR's self-images: | am a woman, | am hard-working, | am reserved) . Qualitatively, all the self-images and associated memories provided by DR applied to her before her stroke. In addition, no significant difference was found between DR and the control group regarding the complexity of identity or the overall AM score of memories triggered by the participants\" own self-images.

Published in: Neurocase : Case Studies in Neuropsychology, Neuropsychiatry & Behavioural Neurology (2016) Status: Postprint (author's version) Discussion This single-case study explored AM and the self in chronic USN for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) . While perceptual and attentional abilities are generally the critical domains in this condition, our data suggest that an AM deficit could be present in chronic USN, in the context of a Despite AM impairment, DR provided without difficulty a series of self-images that define herself, with similar qualitative properties as healthy participants. While AM and the self-share a strong relationship at the theoretical level (the SMS model; Conway, 2005) , our results fit with the growing body of clinical research using the | AM task showing that AM impairment does not consistently lead to a loss or an impoverishment on patients' personal memories. While our results support to some extent the impact of USN on the ability to form mental representations of the past, an open question is whether Saj et al. 's results would be different if people with USN have to represent past events along an individualized mental time line, built on personally meaningful temporal labels or milestones (e. g. , my wedding, the birth of my child, my hospitalization) . Also of interest, Saj and colleagues showed that the difficulties in representing events along a mental time line are restricted to the past and do not extend to the representation of the future. Considering that AM and episodic future thought (i. e. , the ability to imagine personal future events) share a strong relationship - notwithstanding that episodic future thought requires additional cognitive and neural resources (Schacter et al. , 2012 for a review) , a future direction would be to explore if our current findings for the past would be similar for the future. From a clinical standpoint, this single-case provides new insights into the cognitive profile of people with chronic left USN. Needless to say, further studies are warranted to explore whether this AM Published in: Neurocase : Case Studies in Neuropsychology, Neuropsychiatry & Behavioural Neurology (2016) Status: Postprint (author's version) profile is observed in other cases of USN (in both transitory and chronic cases) and to disentangle the precise relationship between the characteristics of USN and this profile of AM impairment. In particular, a critical issue would be to compare memories with matched temporal distance that were encoded before or after the occurrence of USN - an issue that we could not discuss in DR's case due to the short time frame between her stroke and AM assessment. A limitation of the current study that should also be addressed in further studies would be to have patients' self-images checked over by their relatives. More generally, these findings support the usefulness of AM assessment in clinical practice to reveal memory impairment undetected by routine anterograde memory tests, but which could have a deleterious impact in daily functioning of patients. These results also reflect the occurrence of subtle AM impairment in patients, whose observation might depend on the method of assessment used and, more specifically, on the cue-words used to elicit memories. Since the cue-word method is one of the most frequently used methods of AM assessment, this suggestion could have implications for future clinical research and the development of sensitive diagnostic approach. In addition, we echo the recent recommendations by Kwan et al. (2015) , who promoted the overall contribution of these kind of studies in creating more effective ways to structure questions in a personally meaningful way, to interact with people with memory impairment. Whether these findings might be a basis for the development of cognitive interventions aiming to support AM represents an avenue for future research. Table 2.

        "other": "over time but also for social relationships and for guiding behaviors (Conway, 2005) . Previous research in cognitive neuropsychology highlights the relevance of exploring AM in clinical conditions because of its impact on daily life functioning, for instance leading to distress in social situations or frustration when not being able to remember (Ernst et al. , 2014; Rathbone, Moulin, & Conway, 2009) . According to the Self-Memory System model (SMS; Conway, 2005) , AM and the self share a . As such, the self has an organizing role in memory and in return, identity formation is supported by a set of self-defining memories. Within this theoretical framework, Rathbone, Moulin, and Conway (2008) developed the | AM task, which operationalized the self as \"self-images\" (i. e. , enduring and important facets of the self, including physical, psychological, or social aspects) . Using this task, clinical findings support that the study of the (Rathbone, Holmes, Murphy, & Ellis, 2015) . However, while images has been described in clinical populations as a result of AM impairment (e. g. , Addis & Tippett, 2004; Tanweer, Rathbone, & Souchay, 2010) , other studies suggest that in some cases, (Illman, Rathbone, Kemp, & Moulin, 2011; Rathbone et al. , 2009) . We report here the case of a patient with chronic left unilateral spatial neglect (USN) - a syndrome that commonly arises after lesions of the right hemisphere and which is characterized by disturbances in the ability to detect, identify and move toward objects or even of the self. For instance, previous studies have documented that the self can be (Illman et al. , 2011; Rathbone et al. , 2009) . However, DR's profile of AM results advocated an alternative view, since the memories supporting her self-images were not semantic or overgeneralized. In particular, an intriguing finding is the different benefit from memory cueing reported in DR, who showed preserved AM performance when memories were cued by her own self-images but not when memories were prompted by generic/self-unrelated cues. In other words, DR provided memories with Based on the SMS model, we suggest cautiously that DR's results could be related to retrieval mechanisms. Specifically, the use of self-images as cues to elicit memories could be less demanding in terms of retrieval strategies, with thus an easier access to memories, than with the use of generic cues. In support, such a finding could be related to the self-reference effect, which corresponds to the tendency for people to better remember information relevant to them (see Klein, 2012 for a review) . Recently, Kwan, Kurczek, and Rosenbaum (2015) reported similar outcomes in amnesic patients when prompted by personal cues derived from previous past events. Kwan and colleagues suggested that the benefit from personal cues could be related to the activation of some kind of framework conveyed by self-relevant cues, which could then help to structure event details. Regarding the current study, and in relation with the SMS model (Conway, 2005) , the activation of self-images in the working self (i. e. , a dynamic system containing goal structures that control, among others, the retrieval of specific memories) would have an organizational function in AM. In particular, self-images would activate, through the working self, a set of highly accessible memories supporting each self-image (Rathbone et al. , 2008) . In contrast, the use of generic cues would require more effortful processes with a first elaboration of the cue, then a further search in memory, then the selection and assessment of the retrieved memory. From a neuroanatomical standpoint, DR suffered from frontoparietal damage, a brain region involved in AM retrieval (Berryhill, Phuong, Picasso, Cabeza, & Olson, 2007; Svoboda, McKinnon, & Levine, 2006) . In addition, according to the SMS model, the frontal lobe is particularly involved in effortful retrieval, which fits well with DR's impairment when memories were prompted by generic cues that require more retrieval strategies. Needless to say, alternative hypotheses could also account for DR's AM impairment. This includes the presence of attentional disorders (i. e. , alertness in this case) or the role of the inferior parietal lobule in conscious awareness (Cabeza, Ciaramelli, Olson, & Moscovitch, 2008) . However, these two alternative suggestions fit less with the differential effect of self-related vs. generic cues on DR's performance and further studies are necessary to support our current hypothesis. In a previous study, Saj and colleagues (2013) showed that patients with USN have difficulties representing past events along a mental time line. As stated earlier, their study did not focus task.

Memory deficits after bilateral anterior fornix infarction Article abstract The authors report a patient who suddenly developed memory loss without any other focal neurologic deficits. Neuropsychological testing showed severe anterograde verbal and visual memory deficits that improved gradually over several months, but not to the point of the premor- bid state.

A 60-year-old right-handed woman with a history of medication-controlled hypertension and diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital for sudden memory loss. She received no formal education but was literate in Korean and had been working as a cleaning woman in an office building. She had no previous history of cognitive impairment, but 3 days before admission she suddenly began to ask the same questions repetitively and was un- able to remember things. On admission she was alert and cooperative but forgot what had happened a few minutes previously and repeated the same questions over and over. She was disoriented to time but not to place or persons. Her speech was flawless, as were auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. Her performance on writing, reading, pantomiming tool use, and written simple arithmetic were also intact. Cra- nial nerves and sensory, motor, and cerebellar functions were all normal. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically normal and Babinski s sign was not present. Laboratory tests including complete blood cell count, blood urea nitro- gen, thyroid function test, serologic test for syphilis, and vitamin B12 and folate levels were all normal.

The patient underwent formal neuropsychological tests 7 days after onset of symptoms (table) . Because standards 1380 NEUROLOGY 54 March (2 of 2) 2000 for individuals with no formal education were not available for these tests, six normal age-matched (age, 59 + 0. 5 years) women with no school education but literate in Ko- rean also received the same neuropsychological tests ex- cept for the Autobiographica ess than 95% CI of control normal. On the Korean Wec! Memory Interview. Scores of subjects were considered ab- hsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the patient s verbal IQ was 86, performance IQ was 95, and full-scale IQ was 90. She scored in the normal range on attention tests: digit span and Corsi block tapping. Her anguage function, tested by naming and pen watch keys ests, was also normal. Performance on copying with the Rey- Osterrieth Complex Figure test showed no impair- ment. However, significant impairment was noted on memory tests. On the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) she was able to recall three or four items in each rial, but recalled none (sixth trial) after a few minutes of using another word list and on 30-minute delayed recall rial. She also had very poor visual memory as assessed with delayed recall of the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure est. However, there were no procedural memory deficits on incomplete figure testing or retrograde amnesia on Au- obiographical Memory Interview. Neuroimaging was performed 3 days after onset of symptoms. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging showed a small acute infarct involving the anterior portion of the body and proximal columns of the bilateral fornices, and a satellite infarct in the genu of the right corpus callo- sum (figure) . No abnormalities were present in structures known to be important for memory such as the temporal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, or basal fore- brain. Major cerebral vessels including both anterior cere- bral arteries were not stenotic on MR angiography. Brain SPECT did not reveal any focal perfusion defect. After discharge, she could not return to her job as a cleaning woman due to continuous memory impairment. She complained that she could not follow TV programs because she would keep forgetting the story, and she could not find the hospital by herself although she had already been there several times. The neuropsychological tests on which the patient was impaired on admission were re- peated 4 months after onset. She showed a subtle improve- Figure.

How- ever, visual memory was still impaired on the Rey Visual Design Learning Test a 15-item visual learning test sim- ilar to the Rey AVLT paradigm. Discussion. There has been controversy about am- nesia and isolated fornix damage. Earlier reports were based on surgical resection of the fornix for epilepsy, or colloid cyst or tumor removal, and claimed that fornix damage does not result in mem- ory deficits. However, Gaffan and Gaffan, in their thorough review, criticized the lack of psychometric data and lack of verification of the extent of lesions in these reports, and concluded that surgical transec- tion of the fornix results in amnesia. Thereafter, sev- eral patients studied with formal neuropsychological tests and CT or MRI suggested that fornix lesions cause amnesia. The etiologies of the fornix lesions in these patients, however, were a gunshot wound and iatrogenic damage incurred during surgical proce- dures. Although there has been a single case report of a noniatrogenic vascular cause, the amnesia in our patient resulted from a ruptured ventricular ar- teriovenous malformation. These patients had sub- stantial structural damage in other areas besides the fornix, with consequent multiple neurologic deficits other than amnesia. Unlike previous patients, our patient demon- strated a discrete infarct confined to the bilateral anterior fornices. Although there was a satellite le- sion in the genu of the right corpus callosum, it is not believed that it played a role in memory impair- ment. ' Therefore, our patient s amnesia is most likely due to bilateral fornix infarction. Furthermore, characteristics of our patient s memory deficits were comparable with those of previous reports with non- March (2 of 2) 2000 NEUROLOGY 54 1381 vascular fornix damage: severe anterograde amne- sia, better recognition memory than free recall, and preserved procedural memory. Although the pa- tient s score on the Symbol Digit Modality test was within the 95% CI, it was at the lower end of the normal range. Therefore, we cannot exclude the pos- sibility that attention problems might have contrib- uted to the memory loss in our patient. Isolated amnesia secondary to stroke is rare. Stroke limited to the hippocampus or thalamus is still thought to be a plausible lesion. Lesions involv- ing the basal forebrain, retrosplenum, or genu of the internal capsule, reported to cause mainly memory deficits, can have other focal neurologic signs. We suggest that bilateral fornix infarction can produce amnesia without other focal neurologic symptoms. Occlusion of a branch of the right pericallosal artery probably caused the infarction, although we could not confirm a definite vascular lesion on MR angiog- raphy. This unusual presentation of infarction may confuse the clinician because initially it is very simi- lar to transient global amnesia. Therefore, anterior fornix infarction should be considered as a possible causative lesion in treating acute amnesia. References 1. Ott BR, Saver JL. Unilateral amnesic stroke.

After 5 days run-in, 15 patients received vera- pamil (120 mg tid) and 15 received placebo (tid) for 14 days. The authors found a significant reduction in attack frequency and abortive agents con- sumption in the verapamil group. Side effects were mild.

Dromerick MD, James F, Meschia, MD, Ashok Kumar MD, Robert E. Hanlon, PhD ABSTRACT. Dromerick AW, Meschia JF, Kumar A, Han- lon RE. Simultaneous bilateral thalamic hemorrhages following the administration of intravenous tissuc plasminogen activator. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1997; 78: 92-4. A patient suffered the onset of simultaneous bilateral thalamic hemorrhage several hours after the administration of intrave- nous tissue plasminogen activator. The patient exhibited fea- tures of the paramedian diencephalic syndrome, including exec- utive dysfunction, anterograde ammesia, inattention, and disturbances of visual perception. During rehabilitation, she made significant gains in overlearned activities of daily living tasks, but her inability to retain new information left her se- verely disabled. The use of intravenous thrombolytic therapy is believed to account for this patient s unusual stroke syndrome. With recent evidence supporting the efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis in acute stroke, patients with multiple hemorrhagic strokes as a result of thrombolysis may become more common on rehabilitation services. 1997 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physicai Medicine and Rehabitli- tation RECENT REPORT of the efficacy of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) in the treatment of acute stroke! will likely lead to the admission of many t-PA recipients to stroke rehabilitation centers. We report the neurological and functional outcome of a patient who sustained bilateral simulta- neous thalamic hemorrhages following [V t-PA therapy for myocardial infarction. We believe this unusual case raises sev- eral important rehabilitation issues and that it also provides an opportunity to review the complications of IV t-PA therapy. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old woman presented to an outside hospital with chest pain and dyspnea, demonstrating electrocardiographic evi- dence of acute myocardial infarction. The patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and received 100mg of IV t-PA over 3 hours. She extubated herself the same day. Within 24 hours she became stuporous but arousable to pain. She moaned spon- taneously, showed downward deviation of her eyes, and exhib- ited flexion posturing to pain. She had mild right hemiparesis, and plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. Computed to- mography (CT) showed bilateral acute thalamic hemorrhages. CT on the second hospital day (fig 1) showed interval enlarge- ment of the left hemorrhage but no hydrocephalus.

Repeat noncontrasted CT of the hcad showed isodense thalamic lesions and no new lesions. The patient had previously lived alone and had been indepen- dent in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) . On admission, she was awake and attended to voice for less than 60 seconds. Eye contact was poor. She was oriented to self only. Spontaneous speech was fluent and articulate, but perseverative. She had severe dysnomia, characterized by se- mantic substitutions and perceptual errors. She registered 4/5 objects, but recalled 0/5 at 1 minute. Overall, she demonstrated severe global anterograde amnesia and retrograde memory loss, with extensive confabulation. Cranial nerve examination re- vealed right gaze preference. Eye movements including conver- gence were intact, and the pupillary examination was unremarl- able. Muscle strength, bulk, and tone were normal, but she demonstrated severe motor impersistence and ideomotor apraxia. She withdrew to noxious stimuli in all extremities. Myotatic reflexes were +1 and symmetric, and plantar re- sponses were flexor. She stood and walked with a flexed posture. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including speech, physical, and occupational therapy, was initiated emphasizing cognitive retraining, basic ADL, mobility, balance and gait training. She achieved a total Functional Independence Measure? (FIM) score of 24/126 at that time. Her inpatient course was characterized by improvement in self-care and mobility; however, she showed minimal cognitive improvement. On the Mini-Mental State Ex- amination, she achieved scores of 6, 11, 9, and 8 on posthemor- rhagic days 19, 32, 33, and 40, respectively. Her most refractory deficits were marked inattention, severe memory impairment, and perseveration. During a 35-day course of inpatient rehabili- tation she gained 25 FIM points, resulting in a total 'IM score of 49/126, She was discharged to an extended care facility and ultimately returned home to her family. At 6 months after discharge from rehabilitation, she showed mild improvement in attention, orientation, comprehension, and the ability to follow commands. Memory remained markedly defective, compounded by impulsivity and perseveration, Stand- ing balance was poor and ambulation was limited to a few short steps in a flexed, stooped posture. Total FIM score at 7 months after onset was 54/126. A neuropsychological evaluation at 9 months after onset re- vealed extensive cognitive impairment, with notable sparing of specific cognitive functions. Spontaneous speech was fluent and articulate, but dysnomic. Auditory comprehension was rela- tively well preserved. Basic attentional functions, including au- ditory span of apprehension, were also within normal limits. She continued to manifest severe global anterograde amnesia, in addition to moderate retrograde memory loss. Conversely, procedural learning of movement sequences was comparatively well preserved. She revealed ongoing visuoperceptive distur- bance, compounded by mild left spatial inattention. Rehavior- ally, she manifested motor impersistence and perseverative tendencies. In summary, she revealed severe bihemispheric cog- nilive deficits, but demonstrated remarkable sparing of basic language and attentional functions, as well as a preserved capac- ity for motor learning (table 1) . BILATERAL THALAMIG HEMORRHAGE AFTER T-PA, Dromerick 93 Fig 1. Noncontrasted CT of the brain, hospital day 7. DISCUSSION We report this case for two reasons. First, it demonstrates an extremely unusual and purely cognitive stroke syndrome which will be encountered occasionally on a busy rehabilitation ser- vice. Patients with this syndrome are profoundly disabled, yet their neurological impairments may easily be diagnosed incor- rectly or missed entirely by an unwary physician. Second, this case illustrates a neurological complication of intravenous thrombolysis, a treatment commonly administered to patients who eventually undergo cardiac, stroke, or subacute level reha- bilitation. With the recent report of the efficacy of IV tPA in acute stroke, ' patients with such complications will become more frequent on the rehabilitation ward. This patient s primary impairment involved severe cognitive dysfunction consistent with bilateral diencephalic involvement. In addition to inattention, visuoperceptual disturbance, and ex- ecutive dysfunction, she manifested dense anterograde amnesia with moderate retrograde memory loss. Her inability to retain new information made rehabilitation difficult. However, preser- vation of procedural learning in functional tasks involving movement sequences and object manipulation enabled her to make notable gains in overlearned tasks such as feeding, groom- ing. and walking. Our patient exhibited many of the features of the paramedian diencephalic syndrome (PDS) . ** This syndrome is characterized by acute slupor or coma lasting several days followed by hyper- somnolence, amnesia, apathy, and vertical gaze palsy. It appears that bilateral lesions are required to generate the syndrome, and disruption of bilateral mammilothalamic and ventroamygdalo- fugal pathways has been proposed as the cause of amnesia in these patients. Most commonly, this syndrome occurs after two separate ischemic infarcts, one involving each thalamus. There have been reports of simultaneous bilateral paramedian infarcts that were not hemorrhagic; most were attributed to an anatomic variant in which both paramedian thalamic arteries arise from a single basilar communicating artery. * A single case does not allow us lo comment on the rehabilitation potential in this syndrome. Rehabilitation strategies that are effective in amnesia from head trauma or hypoxia were tried in this patient but were unsuccessful because of the severity and persistence of her amnesia and abulia. Pharmacological options were limited by her medical comorbidities. Other patients may do better; the anatomic and vascular complexity of the thalamus and posterior circulation allows great variability in presentation, severity, and outcome. Two patients with PDS were reported to have eventu- ally returned to work, and one of these patients was thought by his wife to have returned to normal. Another patient was apparently recovered to be independent in basic ADL. * We believe that the use of an intravenous thrombolytic agent accounts for this unusual hemorrhagic event in our patient. Bleeding is by far the most common complication of thromboly- sis, and t-PA therapy for myocardial infarction confers an over- all cerebral hemorrhage rate of about 0. 6%. '*\"\" For patients treated with thrombolytics for stroke, rates of cerebral hemor- rhage are much higher, from 6% to 40%. '\"** Proposed risk factors include age greater than 65 years, hypertension, and aspirin use. As in our patient, neurological symptoms typically occur between 7 and 96 hours after initiation of thrombolysis. Most intracranial hemorrhages occurring after thrombolysis for myocardial ischemia are lobar in location (70%) , other locations being thalamus (17%) and brain stem or cerebellum (13%) . ' Roughly a third of patients who suffer intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication of cardiac thrombolytic therapy present with blecding at multiple sites within the brain. The predominance of lobar hemorrhages has led to speculation that amyloid angiopathy may underly many of these injuries. Others suggest that postthrombolysis hemorrhage occurs at the sites of previ- ous, perhaps silent, infarcts. * The latter explanation seems more likely in our patient with bilateral deep gray matter lesions. In the short run, IV t-PA will probably have very little effect on rehabilitation. The patient population to which IV t-PA will initially be available will be small because of the need to evalu- ate, perform CT, and begin drug infusion within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Arch Phys Med Rehabil Vol 78, January 1997 94 BILATERAL THALAMIC HEMORRHAGE AFTER T-PA, Dromerick for stroke demonstrate unacceptable rates of cerebral hemor- thage when drug is administered beyond 3 hours. Because of this strict time limitation, we estimate that no more than 5% of stroke patients will be eligible for IV t-PA in our tertiary care center. Moreover, although some patients may be helped by the treatment, there will be an increase in symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage associated with its use in other patients, which may counterbalance the effect of IV t-PA on rehabilitation popula- tions. We believe that rehabilitation physicians should only rarely refer their patients for IV t-PA. As of this writing, IV t-PA has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in stroke. Thus, physicians are likely to adhere strictly to the National Institutes of Health trial IV t-PA inclusions: onset of symptoms within 3 hours, no evidence of cerebral hemor- rhage on CT, no history of cerebral hemorrhage, no history of surgery within {4 days, and no use of anticoagulants within 48 hours. We anticipate that few rehabilitation inpatients, and only an occasional rehabilitation outpatient, will qualify. In summary, we report a remarkable cognitive syndrome re- sulting from an extremely unusual cerebrovascular accident. The likely cause of this patient s cerebral hemorrhage was intra- venous thrombolytic therapy, and rehabilitation physicians may encounter more such patients if the use of TV t-PA for acute stroke becomes widespread. Since the acceptance of this article, [V t-PA has been ap- proved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in acute stroke. A multicenter trial of the use of IV t-PA in acute stroke for 3 to 5 hours after the onset of symptoms is planned. References 1. rt-PA Stroke Study Group.

Detailed laboratory investigations were normal except for a mildly decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0. 355 wIU/mL (normal, =0. 4 U/mL) , a C-reactive protein level of 3. 8 mg/dL, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 107 mm/hour. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion involving the anterior genu fornices, char- acterized by T2-signal hyperintensity and restricted diffu- sion, consistent with acute ischemia (Fig 1) . Head and neck magnetic resonance angiography and echocardiogra- phy were unremarkable. The patient complained of a mild frontal headache without shoulder pain, jaw claudication, weight changes, or blurred vision. A superficial temporal artery biopsy was diagnostic for GCA (Fig 2) . She was treated with oral corticosteroids. Discussion GCA isa systemic vasculitis typically involving medium- and large-sized arteries, particularly the superficial tempo- ral artery, with potentially serious ischemic consequences if untreated. GCA also may involve the intracranial vessels. Headache is present in about 75% of biopsy-proven GCA cases, with low ESR in about 25% of cases.

Cerebrovascular ischemic events are reported in 3%-4% of patients with GCA, with involvement of extracranial, vertebral, and carotid arteries, as well as intracranial ar- teries. Small cerebral vessel involvement has been found on autopsy, and lacunar infarctions have been reported on brain MRI. Approximately 0. 15 % of first-ever ischemic strokes are blamed on GCA. \" In a series of 287 biopsy-proven cases of GCA, stroke developed in 7 (close to 3%) , 1 of which in the carotid territory distri- bution. \" The blood supply to the fornix derives from small ante- rior cerebral artery branches passing through the anterior perforated substance. These same branches supply other surrounding structures as well. * Damage to the fornix can result in dementia. '* Anterograde amnesia due to iso- lated infarction of the anterior fornix is a rare syndrome, likely due to the delicate blood supply to this important structure.

McCCartTHy* and ELIZABETH K. WARRINGTON National Hospital, Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG, U. K. (Received 8 October 1991; accepted 6 March 1992) Abstract We describe our further investigations of the retrograde amnesia in a single case. R. F. R. became globally amnesic following an attack of Herpes Simplex Encephalitis. He could generate and recognize superordinate level information about the vast majority of proper names including the names of people but he was very impaired at giving information about what had happened to these same individuals. He could also provide detailed information about family friends but he could not recall salient major personal episodes in which these same individuals had been involved. Knowledge of people appears to be represented in a different way to that of events, even when a singular event has provided the main or only opportunity for learning about the individual. INTRODUCTION IN ANALYSES of the amnesic syndrome, researchers have tended to focus on anterograde impairments rather than retrograde memory loss. Where memory for premorbid information is concerned, the emphasis of research had tended to be on anatomical rather than analytic issues. Debates about the presence or absence of retrograde impairment in one syndrome or another and the presence or absence of temporal gradients have been common themes [1, 14, 19]. By contrast, investigations of the anterograde syndrome have been concerned with analytic questions and there is a vast and growing literature on the types of memory tests that amnesic patients can and cannot perform. However, recent reports have established that retrograde amnesia may be at least as complex in its characteristics as is the anterograde amnesic syndrome. As in the case of anterograde amnesia dissociations have been documented between different types of memory content and different types of memory test. It has become abundantly clear that retrograde amnesia does not necessarily encompass all information acquired premorbidly [4-6]. A number of dissociations have been documented between those classes of material which are lost and those which are retained from the premorbid period; the ability to recall semantic information (e. g. word meanings) dissociates from recall of autobiographical information [9, 10, 12, 23]. Furthermore, autobiographical information may itself fractionate into personal semantics and event knowledge [4, 6]. Retrograde amnesia, like anterograde amnesia, also appears to vary according to the method by which memories are assessed. Name completion and familiarity judgements may be spared by comparison with conventional recall or recognition tests [13, 17]. *Address for correspondence: Dr R. A. McCarthy, King s College, Cambridge CB2 1ST, U. K. 633 634 R. A. McCartuy and E. K. WarRINGTON This report describes our further investigations of R. F. R. , a patient with severe retrograde and anterograde memory loss due to herpes simplex encephalitis [20]. We were led to undertake these studies by the remarkable quality of some of R. F. R. s responses on tests of retrograde event knowledge. We wish to put on record a hitherto undocumented dissociation within retrograde amnesia, namely the selective preservation of semantic or context-independent knowledge of people with concomitant loss of memory for events involving those same individuals. It will be argued that these findings are consistent with a two-factor account of person recognition and person identification. CASE REPORT R. F. R. was a senior policeman who became densely amnesic following an attack of Herpes Simplex Encephalitis. A CT scan Showed bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions which extended laterally into the temporal cortex on the right (see Fig. 1) . Psychometric assessment showed him to be functioning at a highly competent level on tests of intellectual ability, perceptual skills and language competence (see Table 1) . In our previous report we showed that his autobiographical knowledge was reduced to a sparse C. V. which could not be elaborated. On direct questioning he could recall that he was married with three children and could give the basic facts about his career. However, he failed to recall any substantive events in which he had been involved. He inferred that his honeymoon had been spent in Europe because he liked to travel on the continent, but could only guess where he had been (Paris) . He knew he had been stationed in Egypt but could not be certain if ie had seen the pyramids or visited Cairo. We also established that whilst R. F. R. was ignorant or uncertain about major autobiographical events {such as to whether his parents were alive or dead) , he was able to define words which had come into the vocabulary during the period for which he had a retrograde amnesia (c. g. AIDS, Thatchcrism, Microprocessor) . As an aside, there was a very striking CLAPAREDE [7] phenomenon when an abortive attempt was made to obtain an MRI sean on R. F. R. He had a panic attack and was unable to cooperate because being placed in the narrow entrance to the scanner was like going into the pyramids . We previously reported R. F. R. s performance on a number of tasks that assess memory for famous people (sec Ref, [20]) . He was very poor at naming photographs of famous people, and performed at a floor level on both the tecal] and recognition versions of WARRINGTON and SANDERS [21 ]) original Famous Faces Test (three time periods only) . However, it was established that he could discriminate a famous face from two visually similar but unknown distractors. He was also competent at a verbal version of this task; he could pick the famous name from two unknown distractor items. He also scored at control levels on name completion tests. Thus when given the Christian name and first letter of the surname, R. F. R. could generate the surname at the same level as controls (e. g. Jeremy T. , David S. ) . R. F. R. s disorder was not confined to public figures and extended to include personal friends and acquaintances. He failed to recognize photographs of his family and friends and only identified himself via inferential strategies (e. g. that s a wedding photo, so I suppose it must be me in the picture or you wouldn t be asking the question) . During the course of our clinical work we were very impressed by R. F. R. s ability to give verbal descriptions and definitional information about people in response to their names. We first noted this when we asked him about his father and mother. He could give a potted biography of his father, including descriptive information, but gave no information about episodes. We extended our documentation by asking him to provide information about named friends; the following are two verbatim descriptions which give some idea of the qualitative characteristics of his person recall . A. W. *: He is a colleague that I ve known for many years. I think that we are both in the XXX unit. E. ; Can you describe him? He is rather a chunky individual. Everything is large except for his height which is about 5 ft 10 in. I m not sure if he has ginger hair . . . . He is an outgoing character of Scottish descent. I vaguely remember joking references towards his Scottish ancestry and his love of whisky. He does have a rather attractive wife with the very apt first name of Eve. Mrs R. F-. R. confirmed this definition adding information that A. W. was greying. When asked to recall events involving his friend, R. F. R. recalled nothing despite the fact that they had known cach other throughout adult life, hc was a very close work colleague and the Godparent of his child. B. T. : He is a fellow committee member of my church. There is something special about him. I think he is called doctor but he is not an MD-type doctor. . . . He is an angular individual who is quite slim although he doesn t look frail. He is balding and has light coloured hair. Mrs R. F. R. confirmed this description adding information that B. T. was a computer scientist. R. F. R. could recall no events in which this very close family friend had been involved, *Initials and minor details have been changed to protect the anonymity of the individuals concerned.

Even when directly questioned about weddings he was unabte to say that B. T. had been his best man. These observations suggested to us that there might be a major discontinuity in R. F. R. s knowledge of people. His descriptions of friends were at least as good as those of his wife. By contrast when asked about events in which these same individuals were involved, R. F. R could only provide very generic information and no specific episodes, These observations motivated the experimental investigations which we report in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS Famous Faces and Famous Names R. F. R. s knowledge of people was tested using familiarity discrimination, person description and forced-choice techniques. Experiment I In our previous report we demonstrated that R. F. R. had preserved his ability to detect familiar faces. He was presented with arrays of three faces, one of a famous person, and two unknown distractor faces. R. F. R. could select famous faces at the same level as control subjects. In this experiment we explored whether his familiarity judgement could be extended to conditions which did not involve direct comparison of faces. Evidence of face familiarity under yes/no conditions would not only replicate the previous findings, but counter the objection that some accidental confound may have arisen due to the specific comparisons required in the array judgement task. Method. The test stimuli were three sets of 30 faces belonging to each of three time periods (late 1950s, early 1960s and late 1960s) . Fifteen of the faces in each set were famous and 15 were unknown characters belonging to approximately the same time period. The famous faces were taken from the original test material of WARRINGTON and SaNpers [21]. the distractor stimuli were taken from news agency material: theatrical casting catalogues (Spotlights) and other contemporary sources (to control for variation in hairstyles and in photographic technique) . The photographs were clear head and shoulders pictures showing the target individual against a neutral background. A yes/no recognition procedure was adopted. R F. R. was presented with each picture and asked is this person famous? . Results. R. F. R. scored 70/90 correct on this task and only made two false positive errors. There were no significant differences between his performance across time intervals sampled (26/30, 18/30, 26/30) . His level of performance is not only above chance level but was equivalent to that of a single age-matched male control (a university professor) whose overall score was 74/90 (24, 24 and 26, respectively, for each time period) . Comment. These findings extend the generality of our previous documentation of preserved face familiarity in severe retrograde amnesia. R. F. R. is able to perform judgements of face familiarity in tasks where individual stimuli must be judged on their own merit rather 638 R, A. McCartny and E. K. WARRINGTON than simultaneously compared with novel distractor items. Familiarity appears to be directly available to R. F. R. Experiment IT During the course of our investigations it became apparent that R. F. R. had retained some aspects of his knowledge of famous people. The question therefore arises as to whether such information is simply at the level of structural memory representations- in both the auditory and visual modalitics or whether his knowledge of targets extends beyond this level. By structural memory representations we mean simply having a visual structural recognition unit for a face, or a lexical phonological representation for a name. We know from studies of face recognition and word recognition that this information is stored separately from meaning (e. g. Refs [3] and [16]) . In the following experiments we explored R. F. R. s semantic knowledge of people. Method. R. F. R. s semantic knowledge of individuals was tested by asking him to define the spoken name of 24 contemporary famous individuals and to provide definitional information (or to name) a photograph of the same person. The photographs were clear head and shoulders pictures showing the target individual against a neutral background. Results. R. F. R. spontaneously produced information about the main or superordinate role of 21/24 of the spoken names. For example he could say whether an individual was an actor, a politician or associated with royality. He could only provide this level of information for 7/24 of the faces. The difference between visual and verbal tasks is highly significant. Some of R. F. R. s responses to auditory stimuli went well beyond the basic superordinate. he could say that Mark Phillips was associated with the Royal family and married to Princess Anne and that Eamonn Andrews was a T. V. personality and sports commentator. Although he did suggest that Trudeau was the prime minister of France , the vast majority of errors on this task were not semantic or confabulatory but consisted of failure to recall any relevant information. Comment. R. F. R. can retrieve basic semantic information about many spoken names. The difference between spoken names and faces is a puzzle. It may possibly arise because the processing demands of the faces task are somehow greater than those of name processing. Face identification may require the subject to reintegrate a richer set of memory cues than does recall of names. Alternatively, R. F. R. s difficulty with face knowledge may be due toa double deficit. He sustained massive Right Temporal Lobe damage and this may have disrupted his face recognition skills beyond the level explicable on the basis of his amnesia. Experiment HI In our previous investigation of R. F. R. we are able to demonstrate good name completion in the absence of any ability to place names in chronological order. So, he could generate a name in response to Hugh G. or Neil K. but did not know which character was the more recent. Method. Stimuli for which good name completion had previously been demonstrated (vis 24/39) were presented for definition. The 39 stimuli were public figures such as trade union Jeaders, politicians and T. V. presenters. R. F. R. was simply asked who is X? . Results. R. F. R. s responses were primarily at the level of the superordinate category and were accurate at this level for 28/39 names. Errors were primarily don t know responses. It is of some interest to note that there was no correspondence between performance on the name completion and person definition tasks (y7<1) . He failed to give superordinate (or better) definitions of seven of the names he knew on the completion task and failed to THE DISSOCIATION OF PEOPLE AND EVENTS IN RETROGRADE AMNESIA 639 complete eight of the names of the people for whom he was able to provide superordinate definitions, Comment. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that R. F. R. has semantic as wel] as structural knowledge about famous people. Moreover these two types of information appear to be dissociable as suggested by the low concordance between completion and definition tests. Experiment IV Method. Two further sets of items were generated with target individuals being drawn from more diverse spectra to ensure that the results of Experiment III were not a sampling artefact. ( Politician being a common correct response on the previous set. ) Stimuli were the names of individuals who had been famous during the last 20 years. R. F. R. was asked first to discriminate the famous name from a list including two unfamiliar names (e. g. Leonid Petrovsky, Ivan Malinowski, Rudolf Nureyev) and then to define the spoken name. If unsuccessful he was given a choice of two major categories in a recognition task. Results. R. F. R. scored 53/54 correct in judging familiarity (failing to recognize the name David Hockney) ; gave appropriate superordinate or better definitions for 37/54; and he scored 13/17 correct in a forced-choice recognition of role category. Comment. These findings have extended and replicated our previous evidence for sparing of certain aspects of people knowledge in retrograde amnesia. R. F. R. has an extensive definition vocabulary for famous people. Friends and Family In order to explore the characteristics of R. F. R. s knowledge of people in greater detail, we conducted a series of quantitative investigations of his knowledge of friends and acquaintances. We have already quoted examples of R. F. R. s excellent definitional abilities in this domain (see case report above) . Experiment V Method. R. F. R. s wife kindly allowed us access to a family photograph album. A sample was extracted and single photographs were presented across the desk in order to probe R. F. R. s recognition of close members of the family and work colleagues. The pictures were rich in contextual cues and showed a range of typical activities such as holidays and family celebrations. R. F. R. was simply asked to provide as much information as possible about cach photograph and to identify the people in the pictures. Results. R. F. R. was only able to identify 10/21 people. His recognition failures included his own children (pictured some 10 years previously) . In one photograph he was uncertain as to who was his wife. He was unable to recognize any colleagues with whom he had been working immediately prior to the onset of his illness, despite having written their names on the reverse of the photograph. His failures in identifying work colleagues included people with whom he had been working for 10 years. Comment. These findings indicate that R. F. R. s retrograde anmesia encompasses a difficulty in recognizing pictures of close family and colleagues. His deficit on this task is comparable to that documented for famous people. Experiment VI This series of experiments was designed in order to explore R. F. R. s residual knowledge of friends. It was carried out with the close help and cooperation of Mrs R. F. R. who gave us lists of friends, where they were known from, and how long they had been known to her husband. Methods. {t) Forty-eight friends names were matched with two phonologically similar distractor names invented by combining the friends Christian or nickname with a surname of similar provenance (c. g. Joe Patterson, Joe Henderson, Joe Petersen}. R. F. R. was asked which of the three names was familiar to him. 640 R. A. McCartuy and E. K, WarRINGTON (2) Lists of old and newer acquaintances were constructed. Twelve old friends and 12 newer friends were paired and R. P. R. was asked to judge who was the oldest or newest. (3) Pairs of names of people who were approximately matched for their closeness to the family were prepared. The individuals were either neighbours or colleagues from work. R. F. R. was asked to discriminate 14 pairs of names along this dimension. Results. R. F. R. found these tasks straightforward and responded promptly. His scores on the individual tests are given in Table 2. Table 2. Tests of knowledge of friends Experiment Judgement Result 6 (a) Familiarity Colleague/Stranger 48/48 6 (b) Duration Old/New Friends 24/24 6 (c) Context Colleague/Neighbour 11/14 Comment. This series of experiments has shown that R. F. R. has substantial knowledge of friends and family despite his recognition failures. His performance is in agreement with his wife with one exception the friend/neighbour judgement task, R. T . R. lived in a small estate of tied accommodation (i. e. provided by his employers) with considerable overlap between his work colleagues and neighbours. His score on this task is therefore highly creditable. R. F. R. is able to judge relative and absolute familiarity. He also has the ability to assign contextual information and discriminate colleagues from neighbours. What and Who Questions Experiment VII Despite extensive testing of R. F. R. s person vocabulary, there was no evidence that he had any knowledge of events in which the names were embedded. This occurred even when those same events must have provided his sole or major opportunity for acquiring the target name in the first place. For example, he was able to say that General Belgrano was a ship but was unable to say that it had been attacked and destroyed during the Falklands/Malvinas debacle. Repeated questioning of R. F. R. about events typically yielded don t know responses without any elaboration. In an attempt to get an objective measure of his knowledge of events we therefore tested his ability to recognize the defining attributes of people vs the defining attributes of the events with which they were associated. Method. A list of {8 further famous names was generated and each was paired with three possible answers to the questions in the farmat Who was? : or three possible answers to a question in the format What happened to? . Five questions were of the What was. . . ? and What happened . . . ? format. Table 3 gives example questions. These name were not intrinsically famous, but had merely become known for their involvement in an ephemeral event. Table 3. Who and what questions: Examples of stimuli Who was Yvonne Fletcher? Athlete/Politician/Policewoman What happened to Yvonne Fletcher? Taken Hostage/Shot/Won Olympic Medal What was the Marie Rose? Airship/Ship/Tanker What happened to the Marie Rose? Bombed/Raised from Seabed/Hijacked THE DISSOCIATION OF PEOPLE AND EVENTS IN RETROGRADE AMNESIA 641 The stimuli were presented in two sets of nine Who was? and What happened? questions using a cross-over design so that each famous name was probed in each condition. Results. R. F. R. scored 14/18 using Who was ? format and 7/18 using What happened? format. The difference between these two scores is significant (y?=5. 6, P<0. 05) . Indeed R. F. R. s performance on the event question What happened? is no different from that which would be expected on a chance basis. These findings provide further evidence that his semantic knowledge of well-known names is preserved at the same time as the ephemeral events that made them famous is lost. DISCUSSION The evidence from these investigations shows that R. F. R. has relatively good knowledge of people as individuals, but very little of what people have done. In providing information about public figures he can discriminate familiar faces and familiar names when given physically or phonologically similar distractor items. His knowledge goes beyond mere familiarity and extends to include very broad semantic information about occupation. R. F. R. , however, is unable to provide information about critical events in which these individuals have been involved. His failure of event knowledge extends to include situations in which a specific and major event has provided the basis for learning about individuals he can define. In probing R. F. R. s knowledge of friends, it was possible to reveal a rich and vivid data base which included information about personal appearance and personality. As with famous people, there was no evidence of any event knowledge associated with the known individual. Moreover, as was the case for public figures, R. F. R. was unable to identify friends when presented in photographs and even had grave difficulty in recognizing members of his own family unless he was able to use inferential cues. There are good theoretical reasons for expecting a dissociation between who a person is and what a person has done in retrograde amnesia. On a trace strength hypothesis individuals would be expected to be more richly represented than specific events. In general, people are cited in the news or known in everyday life through a series of events; people s names are experienced more frequently and present the subject with more learning opportunities than singular episodes. In conflict with a simple frequency-mediated learning view are the observations that R. F. R. knew about people associated with very specific events but not the events themselves. An explanation in terms of importance or significance does not seem adequate either. R. F. R. could recall detailed information about a friend s appearance but not their involvement in highly salient personal events. An extreme counter-example of the salience interpretation being R. F. R. s ability to give a potted biography of his father but failure to recall the circumstances or date of his death. These observations suggest that the memories of people and events differ in kind as well as in strength . The findings might also be predicted by the hypothesis that amnesia results from a failure to retrieve contextual information. The contextual memory hypothesis can be framed as drawing a major distinction between semantic definitional knowledge and contextual information such as that provided by unique definition then the present dissociation would be expected. Evidence from the aphasias and from prosopagnosia have shown that name definition and face recognition tasks can be selectively impaired- -sparing knowledge of events involving the same people [9, 11, 18]. R. F. R. might be considered as showing the complementary syndrome with preservation of gnosis and impairment of episodic information. It may be fruitful to draw an analogy between the dissociations for what happened and who is which have been documented here and the classical linguistic division between syntax and lexical semantics. R. F. R. has an intact core visual, lexical and even a basic semantic representation of people. However, he has lost the syntax of events in which to embed them. One might consider his disorder of person recognition and person recall as comparable to that of a patient whose problem with sentences and grammar masks their processing of single words. If the right types of single word picture-pointing task are used thena rich vocabulary may be demonstrable even in the severest agrammatic. However, ifthe same patient is tested using the same vocabulary embedded in reversible or morphologically complex sentences, then a comprehension impairment would be apparent. In such cases the choice of clinical test determines whether the comprehension loss is specific to sentences, or encompasses language (sec, e. g. Ref. [16], for discussion) . By analogy, the amnesic patient may have intact core representations of people but there may be constraints on how this information is accessed. The present data indicate that R. F. R. is far from being amnestic for people, his amnesia appears to be for events. People are actors in events and many person identification tasks require the use of event knowledge. Event knowledge may be needed in order to access detailed information about some people (e. g. X seemed pleasant because of the way they reacted on one occasion, I was surprised at how small Y was when I saw him) . Event knowledge might also be required so that one can differentiate the records of one individual from another (e. g. the names Edward Kennedy and Robert Kennedy might be differentiated on the basis of events rather than because of their personalities) . If R. F. R. s person knowledge is tested using techniques which are insufficiently constrained, or unsuitable for direct access to core information about people, then he appears to have global memory failure. R. F. R. appeared to have qualitatively different information available for friends and family as compared with public figures . A direct quantitative comparison between the two domains of people knowledge is not possible or feasible. However, the fluency of his friend recall and its richness contrasted with the skeletal superordinate role definitions which he THE DISSOCIATION OF PEOPLE AND EVENTS IN RETROGRADE AMNESIA 643 used in defining famous people. Whether this reflects the greater strength and accessibility of information concerning personal friends, the different contributions of event knowledge in retrieving the two classes of information, or even a difference in the types of access procedure required for this ostensibly similar information remains a question for further research. Memory for people is clearly more complex than hitherto imagined. Characters are not simply episodic nor simply semantic but may be both. Amnesia for people critically depends on how it is tested and probably also on who is being remembered. The present findings reinforce the contention that retrograde amnesia is more complex and much more intriguing than hitherto supposed. Conflicting results from different laboratories may well be the product of apparently innocuous differences in testing procedures. Disagreements may stem not only from differences in item salience across decades but also from differences in specific testing techniques which themselves interact with item status. The further analysis of single cases of retrograde anmesia may well clarify these issues. Acknowledgements We are grateful to Dr G.

However, the 642 R. A. McCartuy and E. K. WARRINGTON contextual memory interpretation would need refining in view of R. F.

If this type of core contextual information is considered as part of the defining characteristics of the individual, we are then left with the problem of deciding why some types of context are part of the defining characteristics of a person whereas others require integrative operations. Moreover, we are left with the paradox that major events which would seem to have just as much claim to definitional salience are lost (cf. the Belgrano effect) . Whilst the contextual framework seems to offer a partial explanation of these effects, it needs elaboration in order to encompass the fact that R. F.

Georg Goldenberg, Uwe Schuri, Olaf Gr mminger, Ursula Arnold Abstract Objective To analyse amnesia caused by basal forebrain lesions. Methods A single case study of a patient with amnesia after bleeding into the ante- rior portion of the left basal ganglia. Neuropsychological examination included tests of attention, executive function, working memory, recall, and recognition of verbal and non-verbal material, and recall from remote semantic and autobio- graphical memory. The patient s MRI and those of other published cases of basal forebrain amnesia were reviewed to specify which structures within the basal forebrain are crucial for amnesia. Results Attention and executive function intact. were largel: both modes of testing the patient pro- duced many false positive responses and intrusions when lists of unrelated words had been memorised. However, he con- fabulated neither on story recall nor in day to day memory, nor in recall from remote memory. The lesion affected mainly the nucleus accumbens, but en- croached on the inferior limb of the capsula interna and the most ventral por- tion of the nucleus caudatus and globus pallidus, and there was evidence of some atrophy of the head of the caudate nu- cleus. The lesion spared the nucleus basa- lis Meynert, the diagnonal band, and the septum, which are the sites of cholinergic cell concentrations. Conclusions It seems unlikely that false positive responses were caused by insuffi- cient strategic control of memory re- trieval. This speaks against a major role of the capsular lesion which might discon- nect the prefrontal cortex from the thala- mus. It is proposed that the lesion of the nucleus accumbens caused amnesia. (F Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1999; 67: 163-168) Keywords: amnesia; basal forebrain; nucleus accumbens Research in human amnesia has identified three core regions where localised brain damage can cause a lasting amnesic syndrome: the medial temporal lobe, the thalamus, and the basal forebrain. However, the weight of the evidence for a selective correlation between circumscribed lesions and amnesia is different for these three locations. There are many case reports showing that circumscribed lesions of the medial temporal lobes and of the medial and anterior portions of the thalamus can cause amnesia. * The evidence for a selective role of the basal forebrain in human memory is weaker and more indirect. It has originally been derived from degeneration of cholinergic cells within the basal forebrain in Alzheimer s disease. * As amnesia is a core symptom of Alzheimer s disease it has been concluded that basal forebrain lesions can cause amnesia. This conclusion is not compelling as neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer s disease affects medial temporal structures as well. ' '' More direct evidence for basal forebrain amnesia is provided by patients with amnesia after cir- cumscribed damage to only the basal forebrain. * In most of them, the lesion was caused by haemorrhage from anterior commu- nicating artery aneurysms and subsequent inf- arction of perforating arterial branches or Heubner s recurrent artery. '*\"* ' ? How- ever, subarachnoidal or intraventricular haem- orrhage may cause hydrocephalus and diffuse brain damage. This raises the possibility that at least some of the symptoms of these patients are due to diffuse brain damage rather than to the basal forebrain lesion. The anatomicoclinical relation of basal fore- brain amnesia is further complicated by the proximity of the basal forebrain to the frontal lobe. Lesions from anterior artery aneurysms often affect the orbital and medial frontal lobe. 4 Disinhibition or unconcern re- lated to frontal lobe pathology may distort or conceal the amnesic syndrome. \" Particularly, confabulations which are a frequent feature of basal forebrain amnesia have been related to accompanying frontal lobe pathology rather than to the basal forebrain lesion itself. The uncertainty of the anatomicoclinical relation increases when localisation within the basal forebrain is considered. Inspired by the parallel with Alzheimer s disease, some authors have considered damage to cholinergic cells in the septum, the diagonal band, or the nucleus basalis of Meynert as being the cause of amnesia. \"* '* An alternative account holds that lesions of fibre tracts rather than cells are cru- cial for amnesia. \" * The basal forebrain is tra- versed by the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles which connect the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus with the amygdalae and with the prefrontal cortex. Amnesia may be caused by interruption of an amygdala- thalamic-prefrontal loop rather than by basal forebrain damage itself. * In this paper we describe a patient with amnesia from a circumscribed basal forebrain lesion which did not extend into the frontal 164 (A) T 1 weighted MRI of the lesion.

Case report The patient was a 55 year old right handed engineer who held a managing position in an international computer company. He had arte- rial hypertension. In July 1996 he became somnolent and confused. On emergency ad- mission, CT showed bleeding into the anterior portion of the left basal ganglia with invasion into the left frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. No source of bleeding could be identified on angiography. During the subsequent weeks the medical records noted mild right sided weak- ness, word finding difficulties, and paraphasia. His ability to store new information was severely defective and he was disoriented to time. He was admitted as an outpatient to our department in October 1996. The hemiparesis had resolved and conversation was inobstru- sive. He was fully oriented, but complained of memory problems: He rated himself as very poor at remembering names, places, and the content of conversations. His spouse con- firmed that he often enquired about details Goldenberg, Schuri, Gr mminger, et al which had been talked about only a few minutes ago. In addition he noted an impover- ishment of his autobiographical memories and a loss of professional knowledge. He could not remember geographical facts, names of other companies, mathematical formulae, or phone numbers which he had known by heart before. He said that he had lost his previous knowledge of foreign languages. He had to translate labo- riously even English which had been the every- day language in his job. Visiting a place where he had spent several holidays, his wife and he noted that he had difficulties in finding familiar routes. As well as his memory problems the patient complained of a loss of libido and of a flattening of emotional reactions. He said: There is nothing which makes me really happy or really sad. It s all far away . Neurological examination showed only a slight reduction of fine motor skill of the right hand, which disappeared completely during the subsequent weeks. NEURORADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Brain MRI (figure) showed a sharply demar- cated, slit-like, lesion which ran from the bottom of the left frontal horn in a slightly curved way laterally. The caudal limit of the lesion was at the level of the anterior commis- sure. The lesion destroyed a large portion of the nucleus accumbens and encroached on the inferior limb of the capsula interna and the most ventral portions of the anterior nucleus caudatus and globus pallidus. There was no general enlargement of ventricles, but the wall of the left frontal horn was slightly widened and flattened, indicating some atrophy of the head of the caudate nucleus. Tc-99-HMPAO SPECT showed hypoper- fusion of left basal ganglia (92% of homologu- ous right brain region) , left frontal cortex (91%) and left basal and medial temporal cor- tex (91% and 90%) . NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Attention The patient scored well within the normal range on a battery of computerised tests prob- ing reaction time, speed of visual scanning, divided attention, and shifting of attention. His attention/concentration index value on the WMS- R was 111. Language In German, his native language, speech was well articulated, fluent, and syntactically cor- rect. Only when talking about difficult and complex matters did his expression become imprecise and circumstantial with occasional confusions of low frequency words. He per- fectly named 20 highly familiar items from the Snodgrass-Vanderwart pictures *' but made two errors for 20 unfamiliar items ( perhaps a goose? for ostrich, and skittle for spinning top) . Knowledge of second languages was not assessed.

On the German WAIS-R his performance IQ was 121 and his verbal IQ was 100. In the verbal part the poorest result was on arithmetic (scaled score 6) whereas the other subtests yielded scaled scores between 10 and 13. In the performance part scaled scores on picture completion and block design were superior (18 and 15) and the other scaled scores ranged from 10 to 12. Executive functions He obtained normal scores on the modified Wisconsin card sorting test, the Tower of London test, and the six elements test. * Design fluency was normal (25/3 minutes: 40th percentile of normal controls) . Fluency for words with a given initial letter was lower albeit still within the normal range (20/3 min- utes: 15th percentile) . Primary and working memory Visual span was above average (WAIS-R: forwards 98th percentile; backwards 90th per- centile) and digit span average (forwards 51st percentile, backwards 31st percentile) . A weak- ness of verbal working memory manifested itself in tests which demand both maintainance and processing of verbal information for example, reading span * (span=2, 6th percen- tile) or a computerised test of verbal working memory (level 3, 1st percentile) . The poor result on WAIS-R arithmetic may also relate to this weakness. Anterograde memory A selection of tests of anterograde memory is given in the table. In accordance with the patient s complaints, the reports of his spouse and our findings, the Rivermead behavioural memory test confirmed ecologically signifi- cant memory impairment. Recall and recogni- tion of verbal information were severely defec- tive. By contrast, recall and recognition of non- verbal visual information were normal. On the Berlin amnesia test, which provides norma- tive data for comparing recall and recognition, recognition of words seemed to be less affected than free recall. A story with emotional content was better recalled than a neutral one. A nota- ble feature of his performance on tests of free recall of words was the production of intru- sions. For example, in recall after interference of a German adaptation of the California verbal learning test (CVLT) \" he produced more intrusions than list words. Likewise, the poor scores on verbal recognition memory were largely due to false positive responses. Indeed, he recognised roughly equal numbers of faces and words, but whereas the total score on face recognition was normal, the score on verbal recognition fell to near chance levels because of the many false positive responses. However, he confabulated neither in story recall nor in daily life. Semantic memory A preservation of basic semantic knowledge was manifested by his average score on the 166 WAIS-R subtest information and by the absence of significant naming difficulties. However, he did have some word finding diffi- culties for unfamiliar items (see above) and categorical fluency was mildly impaired with the exception of musical instruments (animals: 13/1 min; birds: 4/1 min; household items: 15/1 min; musical instruments: 12/1 min) . Drawing familiar objects from memory was good. We could not assess his professional knowledge but he credibly assured us that it had become severely defective. On a famous faces test which presents faces of 15 famous persons from each decade and asks for the famous per- sons names and for semantic information about them his scores were at the 5th percentile of age matched controls for persons famous between 1966 to 1975, below the Ist percentile for 1976 to 1985, and between the 5th and 25th percentile for 1945 to 1965 and after 1986. In this test he never produced a wrong name and only once wrong semantic infor- mation ( American Secretary for Foreign Affairs for Winston Churchill) . All other errors were constituted by don t know responses. Autobiographical memory The patient complained of an impoverishment of his entire autobiographical memory. On the autobiographical memory interview ? knowl- edge about autobiographical facts was good for childhood and for recent time (17. 5 and 18 out of 21) but defective for early adulthood (11/21) . Recall of autobiographical incidents was borderline to abnormal for all time periods and showed a similar time gradient with the most severe loss for early adulthood (child- hood: 6/9; early adulthood: 1/9; recent time: 4/9) . Recall of autobiographical episodes was further explored with a modified Crovitz technique. \" He was presented with 60 cue words (for example, train, friendship, hostility, swim, laugh, destroy) . He was asked to produce an autobiographical episode related to each word and to say from which period of his life it stems. Episodes were rated for specifity and richness. He produced only 35 episodes, which is below average. In addition, he gave 12 general statements without episodic character, and refused to produce more specific infor- mation when requested to do so. In parallel to the famous faces test, production was poorest for the period from 1976 to 1985. We could not check the veracity of those episodes which he produced but they did seem to be plausibly true memories. Discussion The patient had a severe anterograde memory deficit for verbal material affecting free recall and recognition. With both modes of testing a significant source of errors was constituted by false positive responses and intrusions. How- ever, the patient confabulated neither on story recall nor in day to day memory. Retrograde memory was impoverished for both semantic and autobiographical information. On tests of retrograde memory he virtually never pro- Goldenberg, Schuri, Gr mminger, et al duced wrong information but stated that he did not know the response. Primary memory for verbal material was within normal limits. Only when he had to maintain and simultaneously process verbal material his performance fell below normal values. He scored normally on tests of executive functions. Verbal fluency was lower than graphic fluency, and there were some word finding problems for unfamiliar items. These language difficulties were, however, far too mild to plausibly explain his severe amnesia for any verbal material. The responsible lesion was unilaterally left sided. It had its centre in the nucleus accumbens but encroached on the inferior limb of the internal capsula and the ventral portion of the globus pallidus and nucleus caudatus. There was evidence of some atrophy of the head of the caudate nucleus and of frontal and temporal hypoperfusion. Similar to patients with unilaterally left sided medial temporal or thalamic lesions* * and two other patients with strictly unilateral left sided basal forebrain lesions *' he had amnesia only for verbal material and no significant defi- cits of general intelligence, attention, or execu- tive function. This constellation is unlikely to be a manifestation of diffuse brain damage. We therefore feel justified to interprete his amnesia as a sequel of the circumscribed basal forebrain lesion. In addition to the anterograde memory defi- cit, he had difficulties recalling premorbidly acquired autobiographical and semantic infor- mation. As these were tested mainly verbally, it is not clear whether the deficit affected visual memory as well. Drawing of objects from memory was normal, but the husband and his wife reported some difficulties with retrieval of topographical memories. Recall of autobio- graphical episodes and of famous persons was poorest for the years from 1976 to 1985 when he was between 35 and 45 years old. Presum- ably, the poor result for early adulthood in the autobiographical memory interview in- cluded the same period. This gap may be an enhancement of the paucity of memories from this period of life which has been documented in normal subjects older than 50 years. * If anterograde and retrograde amnesia had a common cause, this would be most likely to be a defect of retrieval rather than of memory consolidation or storage. There are, however, other patients with basal forebrain amnesia in whom premorbidly acquired auto- biographical *! and semantic memory were normal. Apparently the combination of an- terograde and retrograde memory loss is not an invariable feature of basal forebrain amne- sia. We think, however, that the published data on retrograde memory loss in basal forebrain amnesia are too scarce too permit any definite conclusions regarding their underlying mecha- nisms. Further discussion will concentrate on the anterograde verbal memory deficit. The absence of a general weakness of execu- tive function does not rule out the possiblity of a specific weakness of executive control of ver- bal memory. We discuss this possibility, and Basal forebrain amnesia then the location of the critical lesion within the basal forebrain. FALSE RESPONSES AND STRATEGIC CONTROL OF MEMORY RETRIEVAL The patient produced numerous intrusions in recall of word lists, and the inaccuracy of his recognition memory for words was entirely due to the high number of false positive responses. At the same time, he confabulated neither on story recall, nor in recall from remote semantic and autobiographical memory, nor in daily life. False responses were thus restricted to memory for word lists. For these words, the decision whether a word coming to mind during recall was correct or not could be based on nothing else but on memory of this particular word s occurrence in the word selective lesions of the nucleus accumbens have been found to fail on tests such as the Morris water maze or delayed win-shift foraging, which depend on mnemonic function and which are known to be sensitive to hippocam- pal lesions. *** It has not, however, been set- tled whether these deficits are reflections of mnemonic dysfunction or of other behavioural disturbances. * Published studies of basal forebrain amnesia lend credibility to a role of the nucleus accumbens in human memory. In a group study of patients with operated anterior communicating artery aneurysms, Irle et al found memory disturbances only in patients with combined basal forebrain-striatum le- sions. The nucleus accumbens forms part of the ventral striatum. Nucleus accumbens lesions were visible on MRI or CT in several published cases of basal forebrain amnesia. '*\"* '* * In a further patient the lesion affected the ventral pallidum and in two other patients MRI showed atrophy of the caudate nucleus. * It is notable that in some of these cases, ! as well as in our patient, the nucleus basalis, septum, and diagonal band, which have the greatest concentration of corti- copetal cholingergic cells, seem to be unaf- fected. In summary, there seems to be rather convincing evidence that affection of parts of the striatopallidal system makes an important contribution to basal forebrain amnesia. ' The evidence for the nucleus accumbens as critical structure is less unequivocal, but does seem to deserve further studies in animals and humans. Because the patient s lesion encroached on the anterior limb of the internal capsula our finding would be compatible with the hypoth- esis that lesions of fibre tracts rather than cell bodies are responsible for amnesia from extra- hippocampal lesions. \" * In particular, the cap- sular lesion may have damaged the anterior thalamic peduncle which connects the dorso- 168 medial nucleus of the thalamus to the prefron- tal cortex. It should be noted, however, that the inferior thalamic peduncle which connects the basolateral amygdalae with the dorsomedial nucleus, runs caudally from the anterior commissure and seemed not to be affected. Interruption of fibres between the prefrontal cortex and thalamus may disconnect strategic processes supported by the frontal lobes from memory functions depending on _ the thalamus. However, as we have argued in the previous section, strategic control of memory processes seemed to be well preserved in our patient. 1 Zola-Morgan S, Squire LR. Neuroanatomy of memory.

By contrast, tests which did not provoke false responses asked either for memory of organised verbal information (story recall, autobiographical epi- sodes) , or for recall of names and information with a defining relation to pictures presented during recall (famous persons) . In these tests, he could exploit partial recall of the memorised material or preserved remote memory for judging the plausibility of information coming to mind. On this account, supervisory control of recall was intact. He used available knowledge for controlling the plausibility of information coming to mind. The source of false responses might be sought in a general enhancement of feeling of familiarity which levelled the sig- nal to noise ratio between memorised items and items which were similar but had not been presented. Feelings of familiarity were assigned indistinctly to any word that came to mind during recall and misled his responses when he had no external evidence for checking the credibility of this feeling. False responses may also have resulted from a strategic decision at the level of supervisory control. He may have opted for a liberal response bias whenever he had no resources for estimating the plausiblity of responses. In any case, intrusions and false positive responses do not indicate a failure of supervisory control of memory. IS THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS A CRITICAL STRUCTURE FOR HUMAN MEMORY? The basal forebrain consists of three function- ally distinct compartments : the corticopetal, mainly cholinergic, system, the extended amyg- dalae, and the ventral striatopallidal system. Cholinergic cells are concentrated in the septum, the diagonal band, and the nucleus basalis. ** The extended amygdalae stretch from the centromedial nuclei of the amygdalae medially and rostrally through the substantia innominata into the medial portion of the nucleus accumbens where they join the ventral striatopallidal system. The ventral striatopalli- dal system is constituted rostrally by the nucleus accumbens and caudally by subcom- missural continuations of putamen and globus pallidus. The nucleus accumbens occupies a 167 central position in the functional interplay between these components of the basal fore- brain and between the basal forebrain and other brain regions. It constitutes a junction between extended amygdalae and the ventral striatopallidal system and it has efferent connections to the corticopetal system. It is therefore able to modulate cholinergic output. * The nucleus accumbens sends efferents to the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, autonomic brainstam nuclei, and the pallidum, which provides a connection to the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. It receives afferent projections from dopaminer- gic midbrain nuclei and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, from the hippocampus and basolateral amygdalae, and from the prefrontal, insular, and temporal association cortex. It is thus in a position to integrate inputs from multiple cortical and subcortical areas including the hippocampus and the amygdalae, and to exert modulatory influences on widespread cortical function.

LUCIA FADDA, ! LAURA SERRA, '! CARLO CALTAGIRONE, !? AND GIOVANNI A. CARLESIMO!? 'Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy ?Department of Neuroscience, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy (RECEIVED October 13, 2007; FINAL REVISION April 14, 2008; AccEpTED April 14, 2008) Abstract Patients with damage to the mesial and anterior portions of the temporal lobes suffer from a memory impairment involving both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. In the retrograde domain, it has been suggested that the relative severity of autobiographical and nonautobiographical memory impairment may depend on the prevalent side of the temporal damage. Here we present two patients suffering from damage to the mesial and anterior portions of the tem- as a result of herpes encephalitis. In the first case, A. S. , damage predominantly affected the right temporal lobe, whereas in the second patient, R. S. , the dam- age was bilateral but more severe on the left side. A detailed investigation of the retrograde memory deficit demon- strated a partial double dissociation between the two patients, with A. S. almost exclusively impaired in the autobiographical domain (both episodic and semantic) and R. S. with poor performances in all domains, but much more severe in the nonautobiographical (both public events and general semantic knowledge) than in the autobio- graphical one. These findings reinforce the view of specialization of right and left temporal lobes in the retrieval of retrograde autobiographical and nonautobiographical memories, respectively. (JINS, 2008, /4, 1083-1094. ) Keywords: Amnesia, Memory, Herpes encephalitis, Hemispheric specialization, Autobiographical, Double dissociation INTRODUCTION Organic amnesia entails a specific deficit of declarative long-term memory, involving both anterograde and retro- grade amnesia. Damage to several of the components of the neural system which underlies the anterograde mem- ory traces [medial temporal lobe (MTL) , basal forebrain, anterior and medial thalamus, mammillary bodies, limbic cortex] (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1991) has also been asso- ciated with difficulty in the retrieval of premorbid facts or events, thus emphasizing the role of these brain areas in the retrieval of memory traces stored long ago (Bayley et al. , 2006; Cipolotti & Bird, 2006) . Although various classifications of symptoms have been proposed in the domain of retrograde amnesia (Kopelman & Kapur, 2001) , Correspondence and reprint requests to: Ivana Buccione, IRCCS Santa Lucia, Laboratorio di Neurologia Clinica e Comportamentale, Via Ardea- tina, 306, 00179 Rome, Italy. E-mail: ivana@buccione. eu a major distinction can be drawn between loss of memory for personally experienced events, broadly equivalent to episodic memory, and impaired recollection of factual knowledge, broadly equivalent to semantic memory (Tulv- ing, 1987) . The term episodic memory refers to the rec- ollection of a person s past incidents and events, which are specifically dated and located in subjective time and space. We include in this et al. (1987) first reported the case of a patient who, following herpes encephalitis, reported left inferior and anterior tem- poral lobe damage and showed severe impairment of seman- tic memory for words, objects, famous persons, and public events in the absence of episodic memory disturbances. A similar pattern of impairment was reported by Grossi et al. (1988) in a patient who suffered from a large, left parietal lesion, as a result of severe head trauma. The semantic mem- ory loss in this patient extended to vocabulary, arithmetic, and geographical knowledge, but his recollection of person- ally experienced events from his entire life was excellent. A more severe deficit of semantic than episodic retrograde memory in patients with left hemisphere temporal damage has also been reported in single case investigations by Markowitsch et al. (1993) and Yasuda et al. (1997) and in groups of epileptic patients before (Lah et al. , 2006) and after left temporal lobectomy for the treatment of pharmaco- logically resistant epilepsy (Barr et al. , 1990) . The reverse pattern of memory disorder has also been reported. In particular, O Connor et al. (1992) described a case of herpes simplex encephalitis with severe right tem- poral lobe damage and more limited left temporal lobe involvement. In this patient, memory loss for public events was confined to very remote ones. By contrast, autobio- graphical episodic memories were uniformly affected, with little sparing of more distant events. Three other patients with damage confined to the frontotemporal regions of the cases of two patients suffering from esions to the mesial and anterior portions of the temporal obes as a result of herpes simplex encephalitis who dif- ered as to the side of the prevalent damage. Indeed, in one patient parenchymal damage was predominant on the right hemisphere, while in the other patient it was bilateral but arger in the left temporal lobe. To evaluate possible dis- crepancies in the pattern of retrograde memory impairment as a function of the prevalent side of hemispheric damage, these patients were administered an extensive retrograde memory battery. The latter permitted investigating both epi- sodic and personal semantic components of autobiographi- cal memory and, in the nonautobiographical domain, the analysis of public semantic knowledge (meaning of words that recently entered the vocabulary) and famous events.

A. S. was a 53-year-old, right-handed man, with an unremark- able medical history until the onset of the present disease. He had completed high school and worked as a retailer, managing his own bar. In January 2005, the patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of malaise character- ized by fever and mental confusion. He was disoriented in time and space and did not recognize his relatives. A cranial CT scan, performed upon entrance, showed the presence of a focal area of hypodensity located deeply in the right tem- poral region, with moderate enlargement of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Several cerebral magnetic res- onance imaging (MRI) scans confirmed the presence of an area of signal change in the right temporal region, extend- ing to the splenium of the corpus callosum, without any apparent additional lesion in the remaining cerebral paren- chyma. Based on the results of neuroradiological exams and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (positive reaction for her- pes simplex virus type | on polymerase chain reaction) , herpes simplex encephalitis was diagnosed. We first observed A. S. in February 2005. At that time he was still moderately agitated, disoriented in time and place (but no longer for persons) , with evident memory difficul- ties in both Psycho- motor agitation resolved in 3 to 4 weeks. In the period in which he was submitted to the below reported neuropsy- chological investigation (from May to July 2005) , he was a fully alert, cooperative individual, with only some atten- tional difficulties, which made it necessary to fractionate the overall investigation into numerous, brief testing ses- sions. At that time his spontaneous speech was fluent, with good informative content, and without any types of errors. RS. R. S. was a 37-year-old, right-handed woman. She had com- pleted high school and up until the onset of the presently reported disease she had been working as a secretary in a primary school. In October 2004, the patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of malaise characterized by fever and mental confusion. Also in this case, the results of neuro- radiological exams and virologic investigations on cerebro- spinal fluid were consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. An MRI scan, performed in December 2004, docu- mented the presence of parenchymal damage localized in the left temporopolar cortex and hippocampal region, near a moderate enlargement ex-vacuo of the temporal horn of the homolateral lateral ventricle. An area of altered signal was also present in the right temporomedial region, but it was considerably smaller than the contralateral one. The below reported neuroradiological and neuropsychological evaluations were performed from February to July 2005. At that time R. S. was a fully alert, cooperative individual, with- 1085 out any apparent attentional difficulty. Her main complaint was a severe memory disturbance for both retrograde and anterograde information. Her spontaneous speech was flu- ent, syntactically and phonologically correct, with only sparse word-finding difficulties and hesitations. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION A. S. and R. S. were submitted to a neuroradiogical investi- gation aimed at clarifying the localization of brain damage and to a neuropsychological assessment of general cogni- tive and, in more detail, of memory abilities. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Neuroanatomical Examination To obtain a volumetric analysis of the anatomical structures inR. S. s left and right temporal lobes, a high resolution MRI brain scan was performed in February 2005. Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted images (TR = 11. 4ms, TE=4. 4 ms, flip angle = 15 degrees) were obtained with a Siemens Vision Magnetom R system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) operating at 1. 5 T. The high spatial resolution brain sampling of 1. 25 x 0. 98 X 0. 98 mm, allowing images to be rotated by small angles in the three orthogonal planes, facilitated the identi- fication of anatomical landmarks for the selection of the region of interest. This sequence produced 128 contiguous slices of 1. 25 mm thickness, which covered the whole brain. To reduce intersubject variability in the total cerebral space and to avoid error-prone, all images were registered in linear stereotaxic space into coordinates based on the Talairach atlas (Talair- ach & Tournoux, 1988) using a 9-parameters algorithm of registration (Collins et al. , 1994) . As can be seen in Figure 1, the patient presented severe atrophy of the left hippocampus. Slight atrophy of the right hippocampus was also evident upon visual inspection (see transverse and coronal planes) . The coronal and sagittal planes of the images showed marked atrophy of the left parahippocampal gyrus, particularly in the parahippocam- pal cortex, while the sagittal images revealed a necrotic area in the left temporal pole. The parenchymal damage in R. S. extended beyond the anterior portions of the temporal lobe; indeed, inspection of MRI (particularly in the coronal plane) does suggest that this patient showed greater atrophy throughout the left hemisphere than on the right, including the frontoparietal region. Volumetric analysis was performed using the interactive software DISPLAY package (J. D. McDonald, Brain Imaging Center, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI]; www. bic. mni. mcgill. ca/software/Display) , that allows simultaneous viewing and segmentation of cerebral volumes in coronal, sagittal and horizontal orientations. The anatomical land- marks for manual segmentation of the hippocampal forma- tion, perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices in the parahippocampal gyrus and temporopolar cortex were in accordance with Insausti et al. (1998) and Pruessner et al. Downloaded from https: //www. cambridge. org/core.

Buccione et al. Fig. 1. T1-weighted MR images of R. S. s brain in transverse (A) , coronal (B) , and sagittal plane of the left (C) and right (D) hemispheres. The sections are all at the level of the hippocampal region. (2000, 2002) . Due to the severity of damage which made dif- ficult identification of boundaries between the various MTL cortices on the left side, anatomical landmarks were in some cases identified with reference to symmetrical boundaries on the right hemisphere. The volumetric measures collected in R. S. were compared with those of the 40 healthy subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 42, reported in the original papers by Pruessner et al. (2000, 2002) . Results are shown in Table 1. R. S. presented bilateral atrophic changes of temporomesial and temporopolar structures (volumes generally falling more than 2 SDs below the mean of normal controls) . However, at the level of the hippocampal formation and of the parahip- pocampal and temporopolar cortices the volumetric reduc- tion was clearly asymmetrical, with a prevalence of atrophic changes on the left side. Because of severe claustrophobia, it was impossible to obtain high quality MR images necessary for the manual segmentation procedure for A. S. A visual inspection of the available images obtained from a 0. 5 T open MRI scanner (Figure 2) reveals the presence of a signal change in T2* weighted sequences at the level of the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures, the inferior temporal gyrus and the temporal pole in the right hemisphere. Two small areas of signal change are also present at the level of the hippo- campus and polar cortex in the left temporal lobe. Outside the temporal lobes, small areas of signal change were also noted at the level of the ventral region of the right frontal lobe. In summary, consistent with the usual localization of neuropathological changes in herpes simplex encephalitis, in both patients brain damage involved structures in the medial and polar regions of the temporal lobes. The main difference was the side of the lesion, which was almost exclusively on the right for A. S. and bilateral, but with prevalent left involvement, in the case of R. S. GENERAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT A. S. and R. S. were given a neuropsychological battery that included tests for the assessment of general intelligence, executive functions, language and visual-constructive abil- ities, and, in more detail, of memory functioning. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients. Raw scores on the individual tests were adjusted for age and education according to normative data. General Neuropsychological Examination As reported in Table 2, A. S. s full-scale WAIS IQ was in the upper middle range, with a prevalence of Verbal over Per- formance IQ, due to poor scores on the Object Assembly and Digit Symbol subtests. On the contrary, R. S. s total IQ was in a low range due to her particularly poor scores on some verbal subtests (Vocabulary, Comprehension, and Sim- Table 1. Volumes (mm*) of R.

A. S. s scores on most of the tests of the neuropsy- chological battery were in the normal range, with the excep- tion of less than normal score (<5%ile of the score distribution of healthy controls) on a phonological verbal fluency test (FAS) and a score in the lower portion of the normal range (<10%ile of the normal score distribution) on a test of copy of drawings. R. S. , instead, obtained scores in the lower portion of the normal range on some tests sensitive to frontal lobe damage (Modified Card Sorting Test and FAS) and on tests of constructional praxis. Short-Term and Anterograde Episodic Memory As reported in Table 3, both patients were compromised on free recall measures of episodic long-term memory involy- ing both verbal data (less than normal scores on the imme- diate and delayed recall of a word list and scores in the lower portion of the normal range on the immediate and delayed recall of a short prose passage) and visual spatial data (less than normal scores on the immediate and delayed reproduction of the Rey s Figure) . However, with the excep- tion of R. S. s poor score on the Corsi span, their perfor- mances on short-term memory tasks were in the normal range. RETROGRADE MEMORY Retrograde memory tests were selected with the aim of evaluating in the autobiographical domain both personal episodic and personal semantic components, and in the non- autobiographical domain, public memory for famous events and word meaning. Due to the lack of published norms, for all of these tests the patients performance scores were com- pared directly with those of a group of 10 healthy controls, composed of 5 men and 5 women matched for age, educa- tion and gender to A. S. and R. S. , respectively. Written informed consent was obtained from the subjects. Because the performance scores of the two subgroups of healthy controls did not significantly differ in any case, the scores of the two patients were compared directly with those of the overall group of normal controls using the procedure devel- oped by Crawford and Garthwaite (2002) to estimate the abnormality of an individual patient s test score when the normative or control sample against which the patient is compared is modest in size. Autobiographical Memory Interview A modified version of the Autobiographical Memory Inter- view (Kopelman et al. , 1989) was used to test retrograde memory for personal events and facts. This semistructured interview is divided into three main blocks, each investigat- ing autobiographical memories pertaining to a specific life period: childhood adolescence (0-18 years) , early adult life (20-30 years) and late adult life (30 disease onset) . For each period, the subject is required to produce personal memories in response to three questions concerned with specific incidents from his own past (e. g. , an event involv- ing a teacher or a friend that occurred while the subject was attending the primary school, an episode occurring during his own wedding or some wedding he attended) , and three questions about specific information about his own past, which could be retrieved without it being linked to any particular spatiotemporal context (e. g. , the address where he was living in the childhood and the names of his second- ary school teachers and friends) .

Scaled scores are reported for WAIS subtests. For the other tests the scores have been adjusted for age, gender and years of formal education according to published normative data (references in brackets) . Percentile scores, calculated with respect to the score distribution in the normative population, are also reported. In the Personal Episodic section of the interview, the score is determined by the descriptive richness of the responses. In particular, for each question a score of 3 is given for the report of aclearly defined episode in a specific temporal and spatial context, 2 for a personal event with few details or for which time and place are not accurately recalled, | for a vague per- sonal memory and, finally, 0 for no event or for a response based purely on general knowledge. In the Personal Seman- tic section of the interview, the score is assigned in terms of correctness, with 2 for perfect recall, | for partial recall, 0. 5 for only one detail (e. g. , only the city or the street instead of the entire address) and 0 for no recall. For both the Personal Episodic and Personal Semantic sections of the interview, the two patients responses were checked for accuracy with the help of close relatives. Two independent raters scored performance of the two patients and of the healthy controls on this test. Agreement between the two raters was moderate/good (weighted Cohen s Kappa for the various scores ranged between . 41 and . 80) . For this reason, the reported scores are the mean between the two raters. In the Personal Episodic section (Figure 3) , A. S. recalled a total of three events, two consisting of incidents without specific time and place and the other of a vague personal memory. Differently, R. S. scored a total of 10 episodes: on one she obtained the maximum score, six were inaccurate for time and place, and three were vague memories.

S. s scores fell on average more than 15 SDs below the mean of normal controls; instead, R. S. s scores, while substantially abnormal, fell on average less than 7 SDs below the mean of normal controls. In the Personal Semantic section of the interview (Fig- ure 3) , both patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls for childhood adolescence (A. S. : t = 7. 22; p < . 001; R.

Analogously to the Autobiograph- ical Memory Interview, the scoring method for this test is based on the descriptive richness of each memory pro- duced and its uniqueness in time and place. A score of 3 is given for a well-characterized autobiographical event spe- cific in time and place, 2 for an event that is less charac- terized or more poorly temporally and spatially defined, 1 for a vague personal memory and, finally, or 0 for no response or for a response based purely on general knowl- edge. The two independent raters who scored performance on this test of the two patients and of the healthy controls achieved a full agreement (Cohen s Kappa = 1) . On this test, A. S. scored 24 and R. S. 38. In particular, A. S. was unable to recall any detailed event specific in time and place, while R. S. was only able to recall two such events, one from her own childhood adolescence and one from her own early adult life. Performances of the two patients were significantly worse than the healthy con- trols average (110; SD = 24. 5; A. S. : t = 3. 34; p < . 01; R. S. : = 2. 8; p < . 05) , with A. S. only slightly worse than R. S. (3. 5 and 2. 9 SDs below the mean of healthy controls, respectively) . Italian Questionnaire for Remote Events This Italian version of the test devised by Sanders and War- rington (1971) for the assessment of memory for public events was developed by Costa et al. (1989) and Budriesi et al. (2002) . The events included in the questionnaire had been extensively covered by newspaper and TV news pro- grams in the period in which they occurred. There were eight events for each of eight 4-year periods from 1966 to 1997, for a total of 64 items. For each item concerning general news, politics and sports, the subject is questioned about a detail concerning a single event (e. g. , In July, 1992, not long after the killing of Judge Giovanni Falcone, Judge I. Buccione et al. Paolo Borsellino was killed with his escort while he was paying a visit to his mother. In which city did it happen? ) and is requested to indicate the correct response out of four alternatives (e. g. , Caltanissetta, Catania, Reggio Calabria, Palermo) . A score of 1 is assigned for each correct response. Because the subject should have been at least 16 years old when the event occurred, A. S. was administered the items from 1970 to 1997 and R. S. only items concerning the years from 1986 to 1997. As shown in Figure 4, A. S. s recognition scores were not different from those of healthy controls for all periods exam- ined (t consistently <1. 6; p = ns) ; instead, R. S. scored significantly worse than the healthy participants for the 90 to 93 and the 94 to 97 periods (t = 2. 9 and 2. 3, respec- tively; p < . 01 in both cases) but similar to controls for the 86 to 89 period (t = 1. 4; p = n. s. ) . Averaging the perfor- mance across all the periods examined, R. S. obtained sig- nificantly worse scores than A. S. (1. 6 and 0. 1 SDs below the mean of controls, respectively) . New Words Test This test was constructed ad hoc to evaluate knowledge of the meaning of words that entered the Italian vocabulary in the last forty years. In a preliminary study, we selected 226 words from the Zanichelli Italian Language Dictionary (2006) , introduced into the Italian lexicon between 1960 and 2000. Ten college students were given a booklet con- taining definitions and were required to write down the corresponding words. The final form of the test, comprising 30 words for each decade from 1960-69 to 1990-2000, was based on the college students performance accuracy on the individual items (i. e. , at least 8 of 10) .

S. performed significantly worse than NCs in all periods examined (t = 5. 93; 5. 72; 7. 05, and 4. 97 for the 4 decades, respectively; p < . 001 in all cases) . Overall, R. S. s performance on this test was considerably poorer than A. S. s performance (6. 3 and 2. 0 SDs below the mean of controls, respectively) . DISCUSSION In this study, we investigated the retrograde memory deficit of two amnesic patients suffering from damage to the MTL structures and temporopolar cortex as a result of herpes sim- plex encephalitis. The morpho-volumetric analysis com- puted on cerebral MR images of the patient R. S. highlighted the presence of a significant bilateral volumetric reduction at the level the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of the MTL but much more severe on the left side for the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex and temporopolar cortex. For patient A. S. , a visual inspection of the clinical MR images clearly revealed the presence of damage at the level of MTL and tem- poropolar structures in the right hemisphere, with minor lesions in the left hippocampus and temporopolar cortex. In both patients, the cerebral damage extended beyond the tem- poromesial and temporopolar structures. Indeed, R. S. pre- sented atrophic changes throughout the left hemisphere, including the frontoparietal region; in A. S. , instead, the dam- age also involved the orbitoventral region of the right frontal lobe. In summary, these two patients showed parenchymal damage which, consistent with what is generally observed in postencephalitic patients, was particularly severe at the level of mesial and anterior temporal lobe regions but that also involved other neocortical and subcortical structures. How- ever, the two patients differed as to the prevalent side of cere- bral damage: A. S. s lesion was predominantly located in the right hemisphere; R. S. s damage, instead, was bilateral but prevalent on the left side. The two patients underwent a global cognitive evalua- tion which highlighted the presence of severe anterograde memory impairment for both verbal and visuospatial mate- rial. A. S. had also some difficulties on tests of executive unctioning and constructional praxis. This finding, together with the behavioral abnormalities this patient demonstrated particularly in the early phases of the disease, is likely related to the involvement of frontal lobe structures documented by MRI. On the other side, R. S. performed very poorly on the verbal subtests of the WAIS, consistent with her preva- lent semantic memory disturbance. On the retrograde memory battery, the two patients per- ormances were indicative of a relatively different pattern of impairment. In particular, A. S. was dramatically poor in recollecting specific autobiographical episodes from his own premorbid life, and in both tests of autobiographical mem- ory he was unable to produce any detailed event, producing only vague episodes or general personal knowledge. On the Autobiographical Memory Interview, A. S. s performance on the Personal Semantic section was still worse than that of the healthy subjects but significantly better than his per- formance on the Personal Episodic section. In fact, he scored approximately 3 SDs and 15 SDs below the mean of healthy controls, respectively. Finally, on tests of public (nonauto- biographical) semantic knowledge, A. S. s performances were substantially normal, with normal scores on all periods exam- ined by the Public Events Test and on the first 3 decades of the New Words Test (he was difficulties only in recollect- ing words entered the Italian lexicon in the past decade) . In summary, A. S. disclosed a pattern of impairment that was substantially consistent with the hypothesis of a specific role played by the right hemisphere in autobiographical epi- sodic memory. Indeed, following damage almost exclu- sively confined to the anterior portion of the right temporal lobe and the ventral region of the right frontal lobe, this patient showed a clear dissociation between almost com- plete absence of recollection of autobiographical episodic Downloaded from https: //www. cambridge. org/core. IP address: 146. 115. 84. 173, on 04 Dec 2021 at 01: 16: 45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https: //www. cambridge. org/core/terms. https: //doi. org/10. 1017/S1355617708080922 1092 memories and substantially preserved memory of public semantic knowledge. Performance accuracy on questions pertaining to personal (i. e. , autobiographical) semantic knowledge was intermediate between that achieved on tests of personal episodic and public semantic knowledge; this suggests a less pronounced lateralization of this kind of retrograde memory which, although concerned with auto- biographical material, conveys information not linked to any particular spatial-temporal context. Unlike A. S. , R. S. s pattern of impairment was less indic- ative of a dissociation between distinct components of ret- rograde memory. This patient scored below the range of normal controls on all tests of the retrograde memory bat- tery. However, if we directly compare the qualitative pat- tern of impairment disclosed by the two patients, some clues emerge pointing to a double dissociation between perfor- mance on episodic and semantic tasks. Although both patients scored poorly on the autobiographical episodic memory tests, A. S. s deficit was much more severe than R. S. s. This was particularly evident in the episodic section of the Autobio- graphical Memory Interview, where R. S. and A. S. scored approximately 7 SDs and 15 SDs below the mean of normal controls, respectively. Conversely, on the tests tapping pub- lic semantic knowledge R. S. s scores were consistently abnormal, whereas A. S. s performances were substantially preserved. Finally, the performance accuracy of the two patients on the semantic section of the Autobiographical Memory Interview did not significantly differ. Across the three life periods examined by the questionnaire, both A. S. and R. S. scored approximately 3 SDs below the mean of normal controls. In summary, R. S. disclosed a pervasive impairment of all the components into which retrograde memory is articulated, but with a relatively more severe deficit in the public semantic than in the personal episodic component. Furthermore, with the caution due to a relative (rather than absolute) performance dissociation, the pattern of impairment exhibited by R. S. appears to be coherent with the hypothesis that the left hemisphere (particularly in the anterior portions of the temporal lobe) plays a specific role in the storage of semantic memories. Indeed, the morpho-volumetric analysis of cerebral MR images revealed that R. S. had bilateral damage to anterior temporal regions, but with substantially more severe atrophic changes on the left side. In conclusion, the two patients described in this study provide support for the view that the mesial and polar struc- tures of the right brese et al. , 1996; Piolino et al. , 2007) . As a further, not necessarily alternative, mechanism underlying the func- tional relationship between the right hemisphere and epi- sodic memory, it has also been suggested that the main role played by this hemisphere in mediating emotional experiences (Markowitsch et al. , 2000) makes it more suited to storing and successively retrieving emotionally rich per- sonal events rather than generally neutral semantic facts (Calabrese et al. , 1996) . As for our two patients, a relation- ship between semantic incompetence and poor linguistic abilities was evident in R. S. Indeed, in both spontaneous speech and formal testing, this patient had difficulty in the verbal processing of previously acquired information, which is likely the reason for her very poor performances on semantic tasks. Much less clear is whether A. S. s poor episodic memory was due to deficient visual imagery abil- ities or emotional processing. Indeed, even though a sort of emotional flattening was noted in this patient through- out the period of our observation, no formal investigation was made of his visual imagery and emotional processing abilities and no attempt was made to separately assess memory for emotionally rich versus neutral autobiograph- ical and public semantic memories. In conclusion, the two cases presented here provide fur- ther support for the view of an opposite specialization of the temporal structures in the right and left hemispheres in the domain of autobiographical episodic and public seman- tic retrograde memory. Although a close relationship between impaired language abilities and loss of semantic compe- tences was evident in R. S. , we were unable to provide a clear account for A. S. s prevalent loss of autobiographical episodic memory as a consequence of predominantly later- alized right side damage. Investigation of linguistic, visual imagery, and emotional processing abilities in patients with lateralized temporal damage, and evidence of a relative dis- sociation between distinct components of retrograde mem- ory may provide relevant insights about this issue in the future.

        "other": "domain both recollection of the experi- ence and retrieval of the contents of the experience. The retrieval of an episodic memory also entails a special kind of experience, called autonoetic (self-knowing) conscious- ness, which allows mentally representing and subjectively reliving a past experience (Tulving, 1987; Wheeler et al. , 1997) . The term semantic memory is instead used to indicate well-established knowledge in any domain whose memory representation typically does not include the temporal-spatial context in which it was acquired. A dis- tinction is generally made between personal and pub- lic semantic memories. Public semantic memories relate 1083 Downloaded from https: //www. cambridge. org/core.

Personal semantic memory, instead, concerns basic factual knowledge about a person s own past, without specific contextual markers (names, addresses, and so on) (Kapur, 1999; Tulving et al. , 1988) . Based on the report of patients with a prevalent loss of the episodic or semantic aspects of retrograde memory, some authors have postulated a relationship between hemispheric side of damage and qualitative features of the retrograde impairment (Kopelman & Kapur, 2001) . De Renzi the right hemisphere (Calabrese et al. , 1996; McCarthy & War- rington, 1992) , or bilateral but predominant on the right side (Markowitsch et al. , 1993) , also manifested a more severe retrograde deficit in the retrieval of episodic than semantic memories. Finally, a more severe deficit in the autobiographical than in the semantic remote memory domain has been reported in a group of patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy (Lah et al. , 2006) . Not all of the reported neuropsychological evidence is, however, in keeping with the above-mentioned hypothesis of a dominance of the right and left cerebral hemispheres for the autobiographical and semantic aspects of the retro- grade memory, respectively. For example, Kopelman and colleagues (1999) reported the expected double dissocia- tion between two patients with unilateral left temporal lobe damage and three patients with predominantly right-sided damage on a name completion task versus an autobiograph- I. Buccione et al. ical incidents task. However, both groups performed poorly on a famous news events task, thus not confirming the expected dissociation between impaired autobiographical but spared nonautobiographical memory in right damaged patients. Partial support to the hemisphere dominance view also comes from a patient with predominantly right-sided pathology that showed a deficit of both personal episodic and personal semantic retrograde memories on the Autobio- graphical Memory Interview (Kopelman et al. , 1989) and poor scores on a famous news events test despite preserved new word learning on a word definition test (McCarthy et al. , 2005) . Contradictory data regarding the supposed hemispheric asymmetry in the representation of autobiographical and semantic retrograde memories also come from the results of functional neuroimaging investigations of healthy sub- jects. So, the results of a recent study by Levine et al. (2004) support the relative dominance of the right and left hemi- spheres in the retrieval of autobiographical and semantic memories, respectively. These authors considered episodic and personal semantic components as mediated by disso- ciable states of consciousness, one prompting the experi- ence of the self at a specific moment in the past (autonoetic consciousness) and the other involving self-knowledge not requiring mental time travel (noetic consciousness) . Using prospectively collected autobiographical stimuli and manip- ulating the episodic/semantic distinction, the authors found a functional neuroanatomical dissociation between epi- sodic (right temporoparietal cortex) and personal semantic material (left temporoparietal and frontoparietal cortices) in autobiographical memory. In contrast, the results of other studies did not document any clear asymmetry in the acti- vation pattern related to the memory retrieval of episodic and semantic memories. So, for example, Maguire et al. (2000) reported a predominantly left-lateralized network or memory retrieval which was irrespective of the episodic or semantic nature of the information to be retrieved. More- over, the findings of a recent meta-analysis of data from 24 unctional imaging studies of autobiographical memory did not support the claim of a right/left asymmetry in the retrieval of episodic and semantic memories in the autobio- graphical domain (Svoboda et al. , 2006) . Here we report and left temporal lobes play a distinct role in the domain of retrograde memory, the first being partic- ularly involved in the storage and retrieval of personal epi- sodic memories, the second mainly underlying the recollection of public semantic knowledge. Regarding per- sonal semantic knowledge, our results seem to indicate less pronounced lateralization of the temporal structures involved, possibly because of the double component, autobiographi- cal and semantic, supporting this kind of memory. Although caution is needed in generalizing the results deriving from only two patients, the presently reported evidence add to a I. Buccione et al. growing literature (mainly based on lesional data) on the asymmetric representation of episodic and semantic retro- grade memories in the human brain. Possible mechanisms underlying the relative dominance of the right and left temporal structures for the autobio- graphical episodic and public semantic retrograde mem- ory, respectively, have been generally traced to the more basic specialization of the two cerebral hemispheres in the domains of language and visual imagery. In particular, according to Goldberg and Costa (1981) semantic memory is mainly mediated by the left hemisphere because of the intrinsically propositional nature of its contents, which makes the verbal code the most suited to memory storage. By contrast, the right hemisphere supports autobiographi- cal episodic memory because of the close relationship between visual imagery (mainly mediated by the right hemi- sphere; Gardini et al. , 2005) and the subjective experience of autonoetic consciousness, which supports the ecphory of previously experienced autobiographical events (Cala- eventi remoti: 1966-1997.

The purpose of this article is to understand the processes of identity change after traumatic brain injury. We describe progressive deterioration in personal identity in a former physician who had sustained a serious head injury (1998) , resulting in focal injuries to the right frontal and temporal areas. He regained consciousness after 63 days in coma and 98 days of post-traumatic amnesia, but has since displayed a persistent loss of autobiographical memory, self-image, and emotional bonds to family and significant others. Qualitative life-story interviewing was undertaken to explore the mental state of a patient whose subjective, first person identity has been disengaged, despite the reten- tion of significant amounts of objective, third person information about himself and his person- al history (though this was also lost at a later stage in the patient s deterioration) . Identity change in our patient was characterized by a dynamic and convoluted process of contrac- tion, expansion and tentative balance. Our patient tends to cling to the self of others, borrowing their identities at least for the period he is able to remember. Identity is closely connected with the processes of memory. The results will be examined in relation to the microgenetic theory of brain function. The brain mechanisms that may account for these impairments are discussed. Findings from this study have important implications for the delivery of person-focused rehabilitation. identity disturbances process studies * person-focus rehabilitation Full-text PDF: Word count: Tables: Figures: References: Author s address: http: //www. medscimonit. com/fulltxt. php?|CID=881381 7490 9 44 Maria Pachalska, Institute of Psychology, University of Gdansk, Bazynskiego 4 Str. , 80-952 Gdansk, Poland CS18 Current Contents/Clinical Medicine * IF (2009) =1. 543 Index Medicus/MEDLINE * EMBASE/Excerpta Medica * Chemical Abstracts * Index Copernicus Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Pachalska M et al - A case of Borrowed Identity Syndrome BACKGROUND The traditional approach to disorders consequent to brain injury centers on the description of concrete symptoms that be shown to correlate significantly with injuries to particu- lar brain regions. This approach began with the pioneer- ing works of Broca [1] and Wernicke [2], and has contin- ued in much contemporary work in neuropsychology [3-5]. AR. Luria [6] tried to go beyond merely listing the partic- ular symptoms observed, introducing the idea of the ba- sic defect, i. e. a single underlying disorder that is presum- ably causing the manifold observable difficulties the patient manifests in performing the tasks involved in a neuropsy- chological examination. Thus a basic defect in phonemic hearing would affect performance in all tasks involved with that function, such as verbal memory, word repetition, read- ing, writing, etc. , while performance should be unimpaired in tasks that do not require phonemic hearing. Only in this way would it be possible, in Luria s view, to describe a syn- drome characterized by a particular set of disorders follow- ing a specific brain lesion. Luria s approach was certainly a step forward, both in the better understanding of the nature of the symptoms ob- served in a particular patient and in conducting more effec- tive therapy. Yet Luria s approach was only able to explain some of the symptom changes observed in a patient dur ing the process of recovery. It does not provide an expla- nation for the appearance of clinically distinct syndromes over the course of progressive deterioration, as observed in many post-TBI patients. One such patient will be described in the present report, with particular emphasis on some un- usual disorders of personal identity in a former physician who sustained a serious brain injury due to a car accident in 1998. The injury resulted in focal injuries in the frontal and right temporal areas and coma lasting 63 days. The real purpose of this paper, however, is to explore the mind of a patient whose identity has been disrupted, and who has ex- perienced the loss of his self image and relations with his immediate surroundings. Case REPORT This case study follows patient PA from the age of 43 at the time of injury until his current age of 54 years. The patient is a board-certified gynecologist and obstetrician. Prior to the accident, he was the head of the OB-GYN department in a provincial hospital in southern Poland. He was mar- ried with three children, currently ranging in age from 13 to 26 years. The oldest daughter finished the Academy of Fine Arts in 2009 and is making a career as a painter. There were some problems with the marriage after his wife discoy- ered that he had had a lover, who, as reported by his fam- ily and the lover herself, he had claimed to regard as the love of his life. In November 1998, the car PA was driving struck a tree when he swerved to avoid a head-on collision. He incurred multi- organ injuries, including a very severe TBI. He remained conscious for a short period of time immediately after the accident, however, and his memory concerning the event it- self seems to be intact as of this writing. An intracranial he- matoma developed immediately after admission to hospi- tal, and the patient lost consciousness. His Glasgow Coma Scale score 24 hours after the accident was 3, the lowest pos- sible. He remained in a coma for 63 days, but was not oper- ated; his post-injury amnesia lasted 98 days. Neuroimaging (Figure 1) shows damage mainly in the right hemisphere, most significantly affecting: the gyrus rectus; the frontal lobe, especially the precentral orbital gyrus; the lower frontal gyrus; the lower, central and upper temporal gyrus. When first examined by the authors in January 1999, the patient was found to be suffering from: hemiparesis; sleeping problems, including narcolepsy, occasional pa- rasomnia and nightmares; mild post-traumatic aphasia, with naming problems; anosognosia; executive dysfunction; inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) ; bouts of aggressiveness; visuospatial disorientation; identity disturbance (does not recognize himself, does not remember his name) ; autobiographical memory disturbance; prosopagnosia (confuses close relatives, does not recog- nize his children or extended family members) . Initial signs of misidentification were observed in February 1999. These included: * inaccurate spatial orientation with confabulation, e. g. the clinic was identified as a garage and he was a mechanic; loss of the feeling of personal identity (the patient com- plained that he did not know who he was, despite the ab- sence of objective symptoms of global amnesia) ; abrupt changes in personal habits and routines (includ- ing smoking and drinking) ; . At that time he was able to recognize (i. e. name) some per- sonal items (e. g. keys, comb, toothbrush) , but denied that they belonged to him. Later in his recovery, he was able to name objects relevant to his past, e. g. cigarettes, a bottle of cognac, but did not recognize these items as being connect- ed with his previous experience. We learned from an interview with his wife that on the day of the accident a major marital crisis had occurred, resulting from the patient s infidelity. His wife had discovered that PA intended to go to a party with his lover. After a fierce quar- rel he eventually backed down, and went with his wife in- stead; however, during the trip there was a sudden change in the situation on the road, and PA drove into a tree while assing a delivery truck. His wife did not suffer any serious injuries, because PA at the very last moment before the col- ision steered the car in such a way so as to take on himself the full force of the impact. The patient s mother is of the opinion, and has often re- eated it, that the cause of the accident was the hysteri- cal behavior of her daughter-in-law. The truth is that her son had always driven much too fast and recklessly; PA has loved sports cars since childhood, and dreamed of taking art in car rallies. CS19 Case Study Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Very significant changes in his habits and behavior were not- ed in the 6 months following his arousal from coma. Prior to his accident he had been a vegetarian, a smoker, a mod- erate drinker, a known wit, who enjoyed social intercourse and parties. . At the same time PA exhib- ited symptoms of mirror sign, and a few months later of Capgras Syndrome, which included suspicion and confab- ulations regarding his wife and children (whom he called imposters) , denial that he even knew his erstwhile lover, and even denial of his dog (who seemed not to recognize him when he returned home, and barked at him) . However, fa. Below are some examples of the patient s problems: Mirror sign A physiotherapist named Jacek was helping PA stand in front of a full-length mirror: Therapist (Th) : Who is that, Peter? Who do you see there? PA: I don t know. Oh my God! That monster is staring at me [shouting]. Th: And who else do you see in the mirror? PA: I don t know, but maybe Jacek, I think you said so, isn t that right? Although he was not able to recognize himself in the mir- ror, he recognized and gave the name of the therapist. He also remembered his own name when asked. Ten minutes after this incident, however, he did not remember that he had been standing before a mirror or what the therapist's name was. Denial of the family Another feature of the disorder was denial of the family. Here is an extract from an interview with the patient in the presence of his parents, his wife and his oldest daughter, who was 19 at the time: Th: You are pleased that you ve been visited by your fam- ily, aren t you? PA: Me? Of course not! I don t have a family. I don t know these people. My family was all killed in an accident. Th: And. . . PA: I don t know these people. They are body doubles. . . doubles of my entire family or I don t know [shouting]! This seems a very clear case of Capgras syndrome [7]. Neuropsychologists and psychiatrists have known for nearly 100 years that a small number of psychiatric patients become profoundly suspicious of their closest relationships, often Figure 1.

They may insist that their spouse is an impostor, that their grown children are body doubles; that a caregiver, a close friend, even the entire family is fake, a duplicate version. Denial of the lover Another symptom we observed during this period was deni- al of the extra-marital relationship (supposedly the love of his life ) . Upon being visited by his former girlfriend in the hospital, he displayed complete non-recognition. L: How are you feeling, darling? [attempts to kiss him] PA: Don't kiss me [shouting]!. I don t know you! After one hour the therapist asked him about the visit (which had been arranged by PA s mother) . Th: So, you have been visited by your girlfriend? PA: That hag is supposed to be my lover? Th: She s a beautiful woman, isn t she? PA: Perhaps I could consider that woman beautiful, yes. . . I would regard her as beautiful, she is about 40, isn t she? No girlfriend of mine could be so old! Besides, P 've never had a lover. Although PA did not recognize his lover, a few minutes lat- er in conversation he suddenly stated that it was not per- missible for a physician to enter into such a close relation- ship with a patient even though no one had yet said to him that the woman who was claiming to be his lover had previously been his patient, and in fact the subject of con- versation had already changed. This might suggest that he recognized her as a former patient (which in point of fact is true) , but not as his lover. On the other hand, his wife is also a doctor, so his pangs of conscience might be related to his marriage, though that seems rather far-fetched. It is nearly impossible to establish, in his cognitive state, to what extent his failure to acknowledge his lover is repressed guilt, and to what extent it should be called amnesia, or confusion. About half an hour after his lover had left the room, the patient asked the therapist, Arent you. . . hmm. . . my fianc e or something. . . she must be somewhere, but I don t know where she is and nobody can find her. It is possible that he was remembering the unpleasant con- versation with his fianc e and was somehow looking for her to make things right. Some traces may have been main- tained In his memory, then, of his feelings for this woman, and these memories were activated, with a marked delay, by the visit of his girlfriend. In his state of cognitive confu- sion he misidentified his therapist as his lover, but the emo- tional memory indicating that the lover had been lost was essentially correct. CS20 Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Pachalska M et al - A case of Borrowed Identity Syndrome Denial of the dog One of the most interesting aspects of PA s problems with autobiographical memory is his complete denial of having ever had a dog, when before the accident he and the dog had been extremely close. This constitutes a first in report- ed cases of a similar nature. T: Is this your dog? [in the presence of his pet, a dachs- hund, who is barking at him. Apparently, the dog does not exhibit positive feelings towards the patient here and now]. PA: Nothing of the kind! A lump of fur like that! I don t own a dog. I wouldn't want such a rubbishy thing! I m afraid of this dog. It wants to bite me! PA was able to recognize public figures, but during this pe- riod he was watching an excessive amount of television, and had become interested in politics only after the accident. It is quite possible, however, that these faces of public figures constitute islands of episodic or autobiographical memory, which excludes any assumption that his disturbances might be linked to difficulties in facial recognition per se. After being shown pictures of two important Polish politicians he stated: \\. . here is the President and the Prime Minister. . . they have power. . . It s them who changed the calendar. . . and everyone thinks that I m 40 when I'm really 20. . . . Identity misidentification This last utterance showed another important characteris- tic of PA s mental state, namely, the problems with identi- ty. Not only was he unable to state his age, but he reacted with anger to an attempt by the therapist to specify his true identity, which is illustrated by the following conversation: Th: Who are you? PA: Who am I? I don t know! Perhaps you could tell me? Th: You are a doctor a gynecologist. PA: No! I m too young to be a doctor. Th: How old are you? PA: Probably 7 or 8 years old. It was eventually established that he possessed some murky recollections of childhood up to the age of eight. At that time he had dreamed of becoming a car mechanic, and now he sometimes claimed to be one. He also vaguely remem- bered his first year at school, but from the age of eight. He complained that he felt lost. This can be noted in his com- mentary accompanying his drawing of a ladybug (Figure 2) : My inner self reminds me of a ladybug. It s obviously looking Jor something because she feels foggy and empty. . . LIKE ME. . . everything has to be searched for . The loss of identity was accompanied by delusions, which is illustrated by the following utterance: . . . the government has not only changed the money and I can t recognize it, but also the calendar to avoid paying the life annuity. . . they added 30 years to the established calendar and as a result I am supposed to be 45 years old, but really, I m 25. They want to get rid of me. I m scared. He would often change his stated age depending on the person with whom he found himself in contact. ao, GG a\" Mae hia g lon a u wy ay ays GT Wit Pe 2 Gigahalea, ue vas Saupe viper Ba Ant posto teh vad SOW ALad Figure 2. Patient's drawing representing himself as a ladybug. The patient's inscription reads as follows: My insides remind me of a ladybug. She's looking for something, because it s empty inside her, like it's empty inside me. Over time PA began to develop an auto-Fregoli syndrome. His lack of a personal sense of identity made him borrow the identity of others. Below are presented examples of some of the more interesting identities assumed by PA: When he was on the ward with a patient named Andrzej, who had global amnesia and maintained that he was a six- year- old clone, PA began shouting that the doctors had cloned him, too, and that now he was a six-year-old monster. When he was on the ward with a 19-year-old patient named Jurek, who had had a knee operation, he shouted that he couldn t walk because he had had a knee operation and would have to use a wheelchair; he also maintained that his name was Jurek. When PA met Zbyszek, a 29-year-old art therapist, he took the brushes from him and refused to give them back. He shouted that he had to paint a picture in the open be- cause he had to earn a living. He answered to the name Zbyszek and claimed to be 29 years old. When a 20-year-old hairdresser was cutting his hair, he took her scissors from her and refused to give them back. He shouted that she could not take away his means of live- ihood. When the young chaplain of the physiotherapy depart- ment, whom the patient had taken a liking to, was distrib- uting communion on the ward, PA took his Bible, which ad been left for a moment on the table, and refused to give it back. He shouted that they wanted to steal the Bible from him and that he would have nothing to pray from. All these temporary acquired identities were based on sit- uational stimuli: the identities borrowed by this patient are content-specific. It is also important to state that these identities have a temporal frame: for acquired identities, approximately 1-2 hours, which seems to be a factor of the maximum duration of his episodic memory. He would mo- mentarily associate himself with an object or person which in some way attracted his attention, though what motivation there was for this particular object or person remains un- known, when other opportunities were ignored. The in- dividuals selected were never older than their late 20s, and not infrequently they were children. Of importance is the fact that after an hour (or sometimes two) PA would forget about his newly adopted identity, and cS21 Case Study Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Mt dereade f Wha Figure 3. A therapeutic drawing made by PA (the task was to draw something from childhood) , which he entitled Maternity. Note that he has drawn two pairs of pregnant women, clearly making them into doubles. This is not because of double vision. again did not really know who he was. Sometimes he accepted his true identity, as suggested by a researcher. However, in gen- eral he would protest, and present himself as a car mechanic. PA s identity disturbances are persistent. The patient still does not know who he is. He continues to ascribe to him- self the identity of those with whom he comes into contact. He believes that his family all died in an accident, but does not show any emotional reaction to this. He complains that he loves no one and no one loves him. He is totally alone, but he has no clear recognition of his situation. After read- ing about Cotard s delusion, a rare psychiatric syndrome in which people consider themselves to be dead, he conse- quently claimed that he was just such a case and was in fact dead, or perhaps reincarnated [8]. It came as a surprise, however, to discover, 3 years after the ac- cident, that his medical knowledge was very well preserved. After meeting a TBI patient who had been pregnant and had lost her child, he advised her in a very professional way, and told her what drugs she could take for the depression that had developed following the loss of the child. In a thematic picture completed half an hour later concerning his most important memories from childhood, he drew four pregnant women (Figure 3) and entitled the picture Maternity ; he later stated: They could have been my patients. But I can t really recall whether Thad such patients. When I think about it I see a black hole, such avoid . He was also able to recognize and describe the ultra sono- gram of a baby shown to him by his daughter, commenting: . . . . it s a baby in ultrasound 3D . . . it could be in the 29\" or 30\" week of pregnancy. Do you think it s that old? It looks very healthy! Yet he protested with anger when his daughter said that this was his grandson, crying: . . . Oh no! Don't try and pull the wool over my eyes! I can t be a grandfather because I don t have any children. My whole family died in an accident. Moreover, he was able to give details of gynecological op- erations, but was extremely surprised to find that he could do so. He did not remember studying medicine, but was able to recognize the university building. This reflects a discrepancy between well-preserved medical knowledge and the lack of autobiographical memory. He had no rec- ollection of having obtained a medical diploma even when it was shown to him, claiming that what he was seeing must have been counterfeit. At the same time he proved to have preserved semantic memory, while autobiographical memory appeared to be lost. Thus he stated that people had children: to develop a so-called procreative family, to maintain the human species, to pass on their genes. Yet he denied having children of his own, even when he was presented with their pictures: . . . These are children, but not mine. I m 18 years old. I m too young lo have children, right? It s not my blood and genes these children are carrying. Chronic status and ongoing rehabilitation PA has been under neuropsychiatric and neuropsychologi- cal observation for 10 years, from January 1999 to June 2009. Treatment was based on a comprehensive model, includ- ing neuropsychological rehabilitation. In neuropsycholog- ical testing we found the following symptoms: * traces of aphasia with minor naming difficulties; minor problems with the production of syntactically cor- rect sentences; (PA does not remember anything longer than a few min- utes at the most) , especially with delayed memory tasks; * persistent disturbances of actuators, e. g. the patient soaps himself in the shower and then leaves the bathroom, enter ing the living room naked in the presence of his children; features of frontal lobe syndrome; * persistent identity impairment (PA does not recognize himself in the mirror or in photographs, though he knows. his name) . asteady decline in his IQ, as measured by the Polish ver- sion of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised; features of temporal syndrome (altered consciousness) ; a high level of anxiety; inability to perform activities of daily living; bizarre behavior, with an apparent inability to conform to social norms (especially laughing or shouting at inap- propriate moments, e. g. during church services) . In this context it is perhaps significant that the metabolic changes in PA s brain, measured by HMRS, are at present close to the spectrum seen in fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) [9, 10]. Figure 4 shows a statistically significant drop in NAA concentration, and also in the relative NAA/Cr concentration. At the same time there is a statistically significant growth in the concentration of ml, as well as the relative mI/Cr CS22 Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Pachalska M et al - A case of Borrowed Identity Syndrome Figure 4. The HMRS Spectrum Patient PA (below-normal NAA peak, above normal ml peak) concentration. Another important indicator is the relative re- lation of the NAA/mI concentrations; this value shows a sta- tistically significant drop when compared to age- and gender- matched norms. It should be added here that the localization of pathological changes in the case of the spectrum obtained from patient PA is similar to that of patients with FTD. In PA s case, however, these changes are localized chiefly in the right frontal lobe, and not bilaterally, as in the typical FTD patient. The collapse of family ties Memory disturbances cannot totally explain forgotten fam- ily ties [11-13]. Prior to the accident, PA s family had rela- tively normal family ties, though the bond between the pa- tient and his wife was strained by the fact that he had a lover. Now the patient does not remember that he has loved any- one, and his family feels baffled by his strange behavior. His wife, his children, and his parents say he is quite a different man than he used to be. They say it is difficult to have warm feelings towards a man who is so quarrelsome, rude, and irresponsible. They feel his presence as a stranger among them. Moreover, the bonds that united and bound the re- maining members of the family to each other have also col- lapsed, or have been seriously shaken. Itis also plausible that the dissociation of PA s identity may be caused, at least to some extent, by his premorbid per- sonality traits. Interviews with his family have revealed that his mother was a dominant person who used to made all her sons to act in accordance with her will despite their own wishes. We learn that PA dreamed of being a car me- chanic but he became a doctor as his mother had wished. It is of interest to note that being a car mechanic is one of his adopted personalities now. It was also noted that the pa- tient s attitude towards his mother underwent considerable changes. He is disobedient and shouts at her, though she shows no emotional reaction to this kind of behavior. It may be concluded, then, that she was always a self-disciplined cold mother, and this as we know - may lead to a num- ber of emotional disorders in the child. In fact, childhood trauma is believed to be one of the causes of Dissociative Identity Disorder [14]. Another significant trait of PA s personality was his tenden- cy to lie. First of all he had a number of love-affairs, which 100 = 50 Bam] 40 = Exam 2 30min 60min 90 min 120 min Figure 5. Recollection of a given event in the neuropsychological examination of short-term memory in patient PA. meant he had to make various stories to hide this from his wife and family. Moreover, his wife reports that he tended to tell small lies to his friends just to make life more interest- ing, to use his own words. Naturally, this does not explain the nature of PA s disorders, but they cannot be explained solely by memory disturbances as well, though memory, es- pecially autobiographical memory, certainly plays an impor- tant role in integrating one s concept of self. At the same time, both linguistic functions and acquired knowledge (including medical skills) have remained in- tact to a considerable degree. It is worth noting here that these are functions that do not concern PA personally. In other words, he has lost mainly the emotionally loaded in- formation, which may explain at least to some extent his emotional reactions to suggestions concerning his true personal relations. Short-term memory PA s memory disorders include not only autobiographical memory, but also short-term memory. Some deficits were apparent on standardized memory tests, based on recall af- ter 20-30 minutes of filled delay, but we observed clinically that he seemed unable to recall anything at all 2 hours after the event occurred. In order to measure this, we designed a simple experiment, which consisted in choosing a partic- ular event that occurred during the ordinary hospital day (e. g. a visitor, a meal, a physiotherapy session or the like) , and then asking PA what he remembered immediately af- ter the event, and then again at four time points: 30 min- utes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes. This exper- iment was repeated 6 times during PA s hospitalization at the Cracow Rehabilitation Centre in summer of 2003, and again in the summer of 2004. The amount of information recalled immediately after the event was treated as 100% for baseline, and the amount of recall at subsequent time points was calculated in terms of information units. As shown in Figure 5, the intensity of the effect achieved when PA records a given event in memory diminishes rap- idly over time, in comparison to the effect that accompa- nied the event itself. The magnitude of the negative effect exceeds the dimensions of the positive effect. Considering the automatic scaling on the graph, the differences at a time of storage of 1. 5 hours appear to be slight, but these differences like the others are statistically significant. CS23 Case Study Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Two examples follow: On one occasion, according to hospital schedule, PA was sent to kinesitherapy for 2 hours. When he returned to the ward, we asked PA what had happened, and he gave a reasonably full account of the exercises he had been through, which coincided in all essentials with the physiotherapist s report. When asked for the same information 30 minutes later, some details were missing, but the essentials were in place. At one hour, however, he remember only the last half-hour of exer- cises, and insisted that he had been there only half an hour. His account at 90 minutes was extremely sketchy, and there were some confabulations. At two hours, he denied that he had ever been in physiotherapy. He did remember that he had already been asked several times for that information, but became agitated that we were pestering him about some- thing that never happened. He began to express indignation that no one had remembered to take him to kinesitherapy, and all attempts to convince him that he had actually been there met with an increasingly aggressive reaction. On another occasion, nearly a year later, he was visited one day by his wife, who spent an hour with him on a day when she usually was unable to come see him. Immediately af- ter she left, he gave a reasonably full account of the event, which his wife later verified as substantially accurate. Within half an hour, he remembered only that his wife had prob- ably been there, though he expressed uncertainty as to whether this had not happened the day before. At 90 min- utes he remembered that someone had been there, but not who. At two hours he was insisting that he had been alone all day, with no visits. Thus memory traces of emotionally laden material, both pos- itive and negative, tend to diminish and disappear complete- ly after a period of two hours. This would not be especially surprising, if the material forgotten consisted of a list of ran- dom numbers or words, or even a story read aloud by an ex- aminer, as in most standard memory tests. In fact, however, PA forgets everything that happens to him, no matter how much it matters to him. Moreover, he does not remember that he has forgotten something, a state which occurs only in medium-to-late stages of dementia. This means that both long-term and short-term memory are severely disturbed. DiscUSSION What makes the case described above nearly unique is the progression of symptoms, which seem to cover an entire spectrum of memory disturbances. At any given moment, the mosaic of PA s memory deficits and retained capacities could be accounted for in the familiar terms of classical neu- ropsychology, as a set of disturbances resulting from dam- age to a particular module or memory system (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, and so forth) . If PA were to be included in a large group study of severe TBI patients, his scores at any given moment would enable him to be as- signed to a sub-group without any particular difficulty. The problem is that if the same tests were administered only a few months (or even weeks) later, he would just as easily be assigned to another, quite different group, ata moment when he seems to have regained some aspects of memory, while losing his grip on something he had previously had under control. B Figure 6. A schematization of changes in trajectory caused by a sudden event Yet it does not suffice merely to superimpose a typical neurodegenerative process on a typical focal lesion to produce a picture resembling PA s symptoms. Though it is not impossible that FTD is developing in PA s brain in- dependently of the TBI, this would be a most remarkable coincidence, and in any event the course of both diseases would certainly be profoundly affected by the presence of the other. In order to understand PA s case properly, it is essential to look at what has happened to him, not as sta- tus post, i. e. a particular event (cause, i. e. the accident) with its various sequelae (effect, i. e. the symptoms) , and not even as a disease, where the onset of illness (the cause) is assumed to set in train a cascade of events (the symptoms) , but rather as a process (the patient s life as a whole) , whose course has been radically altered by an event. it. The first person singular does not exist, either as a grammatical function or as a psychological cat- egory, only a kind of primordial chaos of undifferentiat- ed being [19, 20]. In mirror recognition, the individual recognizes her/him- self only in others, especially parents. The individual pla- giarizes a self perceived as being their own self. There is no chance for making independent choices that would not be consistent with the choices made by the signifi- cant other, whose reflection is one s own self. In deferred identity, the maturing self becomes aware of its otherness, and at the same time of its incompleteness, which it strives to fill with selected contents. There is an attempt to distance oneself from the previous points of identification, replacing them with new ones, as teenag- ers rebel against their parents and begin to identify them- selves with other kinds of groups. In mature identity there is a delicate balance maintained between a sense of belonging and a sense of one s own uniqueness, between continuity and change. These phases are typically presented as phases in human development over one s lifespan, but in the case of our pa- tients it is possible to see each of them emerging after coma through all four phases. In akinetic mutism and the phases that follow, the patient shows no willful behavior in spite of possessing a working nervous system, central and peripher- al, primarily because there is no consciousness that action as such exists or is units, making it possible not only to feel one s existence in the present moment, but also to con- ceive of that existence in the past and imagine it continu- ing into the future. The case of PA demonstrates that the minimal self can per- sist, stranded in the moment, without the privilege of men- tal time travel that episodic memory affords. An integrat- ed longitudinal self, however, requires alignment of one s current mental state and enduring semantic knowledge of personal traits, goals, beliefs, and values. It requires seam- less access to the episodic memory of past and present selves that ground semantic self knowledge and infuse it with emo- tional meaning. In other words, a person whose identity is stable needs to be: * conscious; aware of past, present, and future; able to perceive her surroundings; able to access her memories; able to operate with reasons, i. e. conceive several options, select one of them as better than the others, and realize It; CS25 Case Study Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 * capable of making decisions; responsible for at least some of her own behavior. Unfortunately, all those conditions are not present in the patient described here, which resulted in the gradual loss of the sense of personal identity. His case, however, allows one to draw a hypothesis on the way the self has to be buff ered in order to protect it from disintegration. The process of insulating the self is secured due to is not actually known, it is felt, intuit- ed, sought after. It participates covertly in thought, but is not ultimately revealed. Variability of syndromes The changes that have occurred in the clinical picture of PA s mental status are perplexing. He has passed through a mosaic of disturbances, which resulted in a continuous deterioration of his identity: Misidentification (person and place) ; Capgras syndrome for person (s) ; Capgras for environment, Capgras for the arm (asomatognosia) ; Fr goli syndrome for person (s) ; Fr goli for environment; Delusional reduplication (without misidentification) of self or other persons; * Loss of identity (Cotard s syndrome, the delusion of be- ing dead) . As illustrated in Figure 9, time has played an important role in the process of PA s continuous deterioration. In fact, he has completely lost orientation in his surroundings, and his attempts to discover his true identity have ceased. Ina recent publication, the first author of the present study has described these changes in self-identity, which include self Disorganization of identytiln Figure 9. Development of syndromes in patient PA over time. many, if not most, of the syndromes of impaired recogni- tion of self and others described in the literature [40, 41]. The problem of personality and the self-concept can be approached, from the standpoint of pathology, in terms of patterns of transition from one symptom-complex to an- other in the same individual, and not as isolated defects in particular individuals within a population. Disorders of the self cannot be localized to separate brain areas, but consti- tute a spectrum in the process through which personality is preserved and sustained. The case described here pro- vides convincing evidence that the stability and identity of the self depends, not on the association of discrete compo- nents, but on a recurrent process that maintains the self-con- cept over time, in aging, through sleep, and in the course of changing life events. Time, perception, and self As noted elsewhere by the first author of the present study [41, 42] the basic components of identity, those that can be weakened or destroyed by brain damage, are the following: * coherence, that is, the idea that being oneself makes some kind of sense, that the parts which make up the whole fit together, at least in a general way; * unity, that is, the requirement that fundamentally there is one self in one body, despite the complexity of its struc- ture; * continuity, that is, the requirement that the coherence and unity of identity last as long as life itself lasts, from birth to death, despite the natural tendency to break life down into periods (epochs, eras) . It turns out that one of PA s problems is the loss of the feel- ing of time, due mainly to the disturbances of autobiograph- ic memory [43]. MacQueen [39] has suggested that when speaking of that type of memory we concentrate on auto-*, and forget about the original meaning of biography. The ancient Greek word disturbed. In consequence, he lives only in the pres- ent, since both past and future have ceased to exist for him. As pointed out by Brown [43], the past is an essential com- ponent of the feeling of the present, which develops out of the immediate state revived in the present moment, while the future does not exist other than as an idea, or a feel- ing of the surge forward to the present [30]. No wonder PA has lost his sense of self, as he has no elements to refer to. To make matters worse, he also encounters difficulties in evaluating the surrounding world, which is blurred and dif- ficult to comprehend. It is worthy to remind here that we cre- ate our picture of current reality on the basis of our previous knowledge and experience [40], and PA has lost an access to them. According to microgenetic theory the primary activity of mind is to chunk experience into private and public ob- jects or events [27-29]. In other words, we are able to per- ceive (or recognize) only those objects and events that cor respond to models created in our mind by experience. The models sculpt a complex reality into meaningful and compre- hensible wholes [44]. As Brown [15] puts it: The inner con- nectedness of the world is not its ostensible relatedness in the world, but its formative trajectory in the mind/brain. (p. 251) . CONCLUSIONS PA is not able to chunk his experience, to create mean- ingful units out of the continuous flow of stimuli he is con- fronted with. Hence, the world around him is chaotic and incomprehensible, and he is an observer, whose only func- tion is to react to situations he does not understand. In con- sequence he has no means to form his self-awareness. Only his core self, acting at the limbic, unconscious level is intact. This is reflected in his emotional reactions to any attempt to make him realize who he really was, as well as reactions to music he formerly liked. In a way, there is a regression to a former state of consciousness, which may also explain why he has stopped smoking and drinking: after all, these are not the activities of the boy he believes himself to be. Acting on the limbic level explains also his inability to con- trol his emotions and his inappropriate social behaviors. But most disastrous is the fact that he has lost his identity, since he has no elements to rely upon. Hence, he tends to cling to the self of others, borrowing their identities at least for the period he is able to remember. Additional problems are created by frontal lobe dysfunc- tion, which makes it difficult if not impossible for PA to assemble the disparate pieces of his foggy world.

        "other": "This is illus- trated by Figure 6. For the present purposes, let segment A-B represent the course of PA s life, where A represents the starting point and B the goal to which PA aspires. The appearance of a strong external force (C, here representing the accident) pushes the vector in a different direction, to his current status, rep- resented as D. What is most important here is that the vec- tor C-D is not simply the result of the direction and strength of C, but rather the effect of C on the original vector A-B. The fluctuation of syndromes observed in PA can be best explained by microgenetic theory. The syndrome described here results from the unfolding of the lower layers of the process of becoming, from core (self) to perception (world) , which frames the mind/brain state. Consciousness is the relation of early to late or depth to surface in this process [15, 16]. Visual and verbal imagery, including conceptual or intentional feeling, arise at intermediate phases, so long as an external world is realized. The arrow in Figure 7 repre- sents sensation acting on the phase of imagery to external- ize and adapt the state to the physical world. The phase-tran- sition is non-temporal until it terminates. The mind/brain state and immediate present develop in a fraction of a sec- ond, replaced by overlapping states. As mentioned in the introduction by Brown and Pachalska [17], a traditional approach to symptoms observed after brain lesions does not provide an explanation for the change observed in clinical syndromes in the course of recovery or deterioration. It provides support for the explanation of the symptom according to microgenetic theory.

The arrow Tepresents sensation acting on the phase of imagery to externalize and adapt the state to the physical world. The phase-transition is non-temporal until it terminates. The mind/brain state and immediate present develop in a fraction of a second, replaced by overlapping states [15]. This case raises the question of the origin of: stability, whenever the world and mind are in constant change; the nature of identity: is it continuous? According to Marcia [18] there are four phases in the pro- cess of forming an identity: In diffuse identity the self is vaguely defined and ill-formed. There is no way even to ask the question, Who am I , let alone answer possible. Figure 8. The interconnections among the self and the minimal and longitudinal self. Our case shows that a self is not a persistent object but a re- current state. Hume (1740/1967: Book I, Part IV, Section VI) [21] questioned the existence of identity, which he be- lieved to be an illusion, and so he could not account for the sense of identity over time [22]. James [23] as well as Whitehead [24] were of the opinion that identity was due to an overlap of mental states. Self has to be created in each moment, and this creative process leads to a more dynamic way of thinking about the min and brain [25]. Microgenetic theory provides an account of the process of creating the self [26-34]. It emphasizes the span of neural time (in microseconds in the case of a healthy adult) that on the one hand enables continuity of the self, and on the other buffers it from falling apart [35-37]. The way the self is structured is shown in Figure 8. There is a minima self, the irreducible core, whose existence is necessary in order for the organism to be an organism, and not mere- ly a collection or colony of cells [38]. We feel this minimal self in our most fundamental biological/mental state, the awareness of being right here right now and having some kind of experience. A longitudinal self arises when mem- ory allows the discrete moments of minimal self time to be bundled in larger the ex- pansion from the core self into the subjective I , then the formation of an object world distinct from the I , which thus preserves its integrity and identity through time or at least for some segment of time. There is a paradox in all this, which is that the subjective self, having created an objective world and separated itself from it, at the same time becomes conscious of itself as an object. The I can conceive of, evaluate, look at, analyze, interpret the me , the self seen by the subject as an object among other objects. This distinction between the I and the me makes possible not only introspection, but also so- cial thinking, the ability to conceive of oneself as a human object among other human objects, without losing the I or at least without the necessity to lose it, though the risk is certainly there. The distinction between I and me is more on the or der of actual and potential than knower and known [39]. The knowing self - the minimal I at the threshold of con- sciousness - knows that which develops out of it. The sub- liminal me that remains beneath as the potential for the LP is implicit, unconscious and inaccessible. It represents, or is part of, the tacit knowledge of the individual, what the person knows or has the capacity (competence) to know, and it gives rise to the conscious self, to thought and ac- tion. The known self bios meant life, and grapho meant to write. Our autobiography is therefore essentially a story, composed of the events of our own life, and is therefore nar- rative in its very nature. It is not, however, an orderly and exhaustive story that includes literally all the events of our life, but rather a kind of sketch made up of only those events which are of importance to us. As a rule these are emotional- ly loaded events, as well as those which proved to be of vital consequence for our future. In this respect autobiographic CS26 Med Sci Monit, 2011; 17 (2) : CS18-28 Pachalska M et al - A case of Borrowed Identity Syndrome memory is more like a play or a film, in which significant events (episodes, scenes, moments) are combined in a way to form a comprehensive and continuous story. The story gains its coherence due to the logical sequence of events, where the viewer is left to assume or infer a logical sequence from one event to the next. In the case of the autobiogra- phy (understood here as a mental construct, not a literary genre) , such a sequence of events is ensured by our mem- ory. Thus identity problems in TBI patients should hardly be surprising. Even if the sequence of symptoms present- ed by PA seems unique, the complaint that one is a differ- ent person after the injury is not [41, 42]. This means that both long-term and short-term memory are severely (7) : 861-68 10. Seeley WW: Frontotemporal dementia neuroimaging: a guide for cli- nicians.

Fert! at above address Despite current antibiotic treatment, a 51-year-old man suffering from Whipple s disease (WD) presented with cerebral symptoms. Clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed encephalitis resulting from WD, which was subsequently treated. The response to antibiotics was protracted, but 6 months after the onset of cerebral illness the inflammation had ceased. Thirty months later, the patient is still suffering from severe anterograde amnesia as well as a lack of initiative. Behavioural and neuropsychological assessment data were consistent with the Korsakoff syndrome. Retrospectively, a concomitant thiamine deficiency in the acute phase of cerebral manifestation was thought likely, and could have contributed to the unfavourable outcome. We therefore propose that thiamine deficiency should be considered and treated immediately in patients with established WD who present with cerebral symptoms, Keywords: Whipple s disease Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome Long-term outcome Amnesic syndrome Thiamine INTRODUCTION Whipple s disease (WD) is a rare systemic infection (Bruyn, 1988) caused by the bacterium Tropheryma Whippelii (Retman et al. , 1992) . Owing to successful antibiotic treatment of an otherwise fatal disease, cerebral involvement has been reported more frequently (Bradley et al. , 1991) . Frequent symptoms are demen- tia, ophthalmoplegia and myoclonus (Halperin et al. , 1982; Bruyn, 1988) . We report on a patient who survived cerebral WD for 42 months without relapse but suffered from a severe amnesic syndrome over the entire period. Our patient s long-term outcome of cognitive function prompted us to further investigation of concomitant factors influencing the outcome of brain function in WD. While antibiotics are beneficial in the treatment of extracerebral manifestations, the results are poor when cerebral involvement occurs (Keinath et al. , 1985; Schnider et al. , 1996) . CASE REPORT A 5l-year-old male employee was admitted to the hospital in December 1992 with a 3 year history of weight loss and recurring episodes of fever. A single short episode of diarrhea was reported 5 weeks prior to admission. There was no previous neurologic history or alcohol abuse. On clinical examination the patient was 1351-5101 1997 Rapid Science Publishers found to be undernourished with generalized hyperpig- mentation and lymphadenopathy. Histologic examina- tion of an inguinal lymph node showed characteristic macrophages with cytoplasmic para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) positive inclusions, compatible with WD. Addi- tiona] duodenal biopsies were performed and polymer- ase chain reaction (PCR) for Trophervma Whippelii was positive in two locations. Treatment with 10 million units of penicillin G three times a day and 750 mg of amikacin intravenously, continued for 10 days. The patient was then discharged on sulpha- methoxazole 400 mg and trimethoprim 80mg orally per day which was suggested as long-term treatment. Three weeks later, the patient complained of blurred vision. On neurologic examination the patient was disoriented, nystagmus, dysphagia and generalized myoclonic jerks were present. The computerized tomo- graphy (CT) brain scan was normal, but as reported previously, MRI revealed small areas of hyperintensity on 7) -weighted images in the left mediobasal temporal lobe (Schnider et al. , 1995) . CSF-examination showed mild lympho-monocytic pleocytosis (cell count 99/3) , a marked elevation of protein (203 mg/dl) and a decreased glucose level. Thyroid function tests, syphilis serology, levels of vitamin B, 2 and folate, calcium and magnesium were normal. Tests for tuberculosis, borre- European Journal of Neurology . Vol 4. 1997 613 liosis, human immunodeficientcy virus (HIV) , herpes simplex, cytomegaly, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) , syphi- lis serology and antinuclear antibodies were all nega- tive. Cerebral manifestation of WD being presumed, antibiotic treatment was changed to minocycline 600 mg and double strength co-trimoxazole orally. Two days later, the patient developed generalized seizures with respiratory failure, so malabsorption tests were not performed. Over a period of 4 weeks at the intensive care unit (ICU) , the patient received a normocaloric total parenteral nutrition with vitamin and electrolyte supplements. He was then fed by means of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with a daily caloric intake of 1900 kcal. His neurologic condition remained unchanged. Persistent malnutrition was evi- dent (body mass index=18, serum albumin = 19 mg/dl) . In spite of the increased energy supply, the patient remained moderately depleted within the fol- lowing 6 months. Repeated endoscopy showed mild inflammation of the gastric and duodenal mucosa but no signs of persistent intestinal WD. Serial EEG recordings were nonspecific, showing widespread slowing with prevailing 5 6 cs acitivity. Brainstem evoked potentials were abnormal, but somatosensory evoked potentials were not. In the post- acute stage, DC-electro-oculography findings with re- duced saccadic accuracy and saccadic dysfunction of smooth pursuit pointed to a lesion of the cerebello- oculomotor loop. Repeated MRI showed confluent hyperintense lesions TABLE |. Neuropsychological profile of R. H. E. FERTL ETAL. in the mediobasal parts of both temporal lobes, the hypothalamus and the basal ganglia, with a moderate mass effect and circumscribed contrast enhancement. CSF examination revealed a decreasing cell count and protein content. The treatment was changed to chlor- amphenicol 1g daily (intravenously) for 2 weeks followed by a 7 week course of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim intravenously. Owing to an allergic ex- anthema, antibiotic treatment was then changed to ceftriaxone intravenously for 2 weeks. Subsequently, the clinical condition of the patient improved slowly, but a reversed sleep-wake-cycle with episodes of excessive hypersomnia emerged and has persisted until now. Six months after the onset of cerebral disease, MRI showed complete resolution of the bilateral lesions and CSF examination was normal. One year after the onset of illness, the patient was mobile, alert and amnesic, but language, visual percep- tion and skills were normal. He was discharged to a nursing home and continued to receive trimethoprim orally. The patient was re-evaluated 30 months after the onset of cerebral WD. He was mobile and needed some stimulation and supervision in the activities of daily living. His cognitive function was assessed on 3 consecutive days by the same examiner. He neither remembered the previous sessions nor recognized the examiner the following day. Initially he was alert and responsive but after minutes became apathetic and quickly lost interest in the conversation.

He was unaware of his physical and mental condition. The neuropsychological profile of R. H. is given in Table I. The patient displayed reduced attention and motivation. Apart from normal immediate memory, learning of new verbal and nonverbal material was markedly impaired though the patient could retain faces for some minutes. His memory for remote events was screened by comparison of his autobiographic recall with his history. R. H. believed to live in the late 1980s and was unable to retrieve recalls of approximately 5 years before the onset of WD. Autobiographic recall of the time period before was vague but correct. Obviously, a retrograde amnesia with a temporal gradient was present. His ability to learn new information was tested by three different paradigms of pair-associate-learning: (1) 5 faces names, (2) 5 words colours, (3) 3 German Turkish words. Each pair was presented three times; the patient was asked to repeat them and recall was tested after a 5 min period. The patient remembered only two pairs, one face name and one Turkish word. Thirty minutes later, the patient was unable to reproduce the learned material spontaneously. He also failed to recall the pairs by being cued by means of a multiple choice task. Language and visuospatial ability (reading the clock time, object recognition and drawing) was preserved. Formal testing of frontal function yielded a reduced semantic fluency as well as severe impairment of concept formation. In conclusion, the neuropsychological assessment of R. H. revealed an alert man with severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia, unawareness of the disorder, frontal executive dysfunction and general apathy. These are the typical symptoms of the Korsakoff amnesic state (Talland, 1969; Victor et al. , 1989) . Forty-two months after the onset of cerebral symptoms the patient's mental state remained unchanged. DISCUSSION Our patient s behaviour and cognitive performance throughout a number of tasks 30 months after the onset of CNS involvement in WD was consistent with the Korsakoff syndrome. Supposed etiologies for the ob- served neuropsychological outcome of R. H. are re- viewed in detail. In this patient with WD, neurologic symptoms occurred after the initial antibiotic eradica- tion treatment and under the current prophylaxis. Encephalitis due to WD was diagnosed according to the clinical syndrome, CSF and MRI findings. Cerebral symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic treatment of the underlying disease, delayed response to treatment and a persisting Korsakoff syndrome as long-term outcome suggested an additional pathogenetic factor. Review of the literature from the past 15 years on cerebral WD revealed that six patients with extra- cerebral WD presented with mental or memory decline and oculomotor dysfunction, but definite central ner- vous system (CNS) infection could not be demonstrated (Feurle et al. , 1976; Schmitt et a/. , 1981; Ryser et al. , 1984; Schwartz et al. , 1986; Amarenco et al. , 1991; Simpson et al. , 1995) . A summary of the frequency of presenting signs of cerebral WD (see Table II) demon- strates the striking observation that disorientation, vertical gaze palsy and memory dysfunction parallel those of the Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) . However, myoclonus is never encountered in WKS (Bruyn, 1988) . The diagnosis of WKS during a pa- tient s lifetime is often missed (Harper et al. , 1986; Victor et al. , 1989) , because the majority of the patients show only one or two signs of the classical triad of TABLE Ii.

European Journal of Neurology . Vol 4 . 1997 615 WKS, consisting of abnormal mental state, ophthalmo- plegia and ataxia (Harper et al. , 1986) . Neuropatho- logic findings of WD and WKS have a similar distribution in the diencephalon and brainstem (Bruyn, 1988, Victor ef al. , 1989; Knox et al. , 1995) . Unfortunately, R. H. s thiamine status was not meas- ured directly in the acute stage. Nevertheless, the long- term outcome of a Korsakoff amnesic state suggests a concomitant thiamine deficiency. Indeed, many rare non-alcoholic causes for WKS are known (Parkin et al. , 1991) , including gastrointestinal disease and mal- nutrition. R. H. was already undernourished before neurologic symptoms occurred. Besides, prophylactic co-trimoxazole could have acted as a vitamin B antagonist (Victor et al. , 1989) . In addition, he devel- oped severe encephalitis, which may have turned dormant Wernicke encephalopathy into the acute form. Hyperalimentation with glucose or a lack of vitamin supplement in the total parenteral nutrition during the ICU stay were excluded. In conclusion, the WKS is a rare but underdiagnosed disorder that induces an unfavourable neurologic out- come. As shown by this case, WD may also cause the WKS. Patients suffering from WD are at risk for thiamine deficiency which subsequently influences the outcome of a cerebral manifestation. As the WKS is preventable and easily treatable, we propose to give an appropriate thiamine supplement to any patient with established WD who presents with cerebral symptoms.

Introduction Anterograde amnesia is a selective memory deficit, and patients are severely impaired in learning new information. Damage to the hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies, ante- rior and medial thalamic nuclei or basal forebrain can result in anterograde amnesia. Some authors have reported that severe anterograde amnesia is caused by bilateral lesions in medial temporal lobe structures [1, 2], anteromedian thalamus [3] or fornix [4]. Others reported that cases of anterograde amnesia were also developed by a unilateral lesion in mamillary body [5, 6], anterior medial thalamus [7, 8], or hippocampus [9]. Behcet disease is a multisystemic, recurrent, inflamma- tory disorder affecting the eyes, skin, and mucosa, joints, vascular system, lungs, gastrointestinal and also affecting the nervous system [10]. The cause is still unknown, but vasculi- tis is believed to be the underlying pathophysiology.

Typical symptoms and signs include confusion, corticospinal tract abnormal- ities, brainstem involvement, emotional incontinence, and cognitive impairments with memory dysfunction [11, 12]. However, selective anterograde memory impairment without any other focal neurological deficits as a presenting symptom in NB disease is very rare on previous literatures [13, 14]. Here, we report a patient who developed severe antero- grade amnesia and minimal retrograde amnesia following vasculitic lesions of NB involving the right anterior thalamus and left hippocampus. 2. Case report A 50-year-old right-handed man was admitted from the emergency room in 19 October 2003 with severe memory dis- turbance since 15 October 2003. He was a school bus driver. He became disoriented and unable to find familiar road. He had difficulty driving in an appropriate manner. His daughter reported that he forgot conversations or events within a few minutes. He did not recall that his wife was hospitalized in another hospital due to an illness, and he was unable to recall K. W. Park et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 109 (2007) 470-473 471 his wife s cell phone number. He insisted that he had to drive his students to their homes on his day off. His remote memory about experiences that occurred several months or years in the past was preserved. He could recall events that occurred in his early school days, teen age and early adult periods. He was healthy and had no disturbances of activities of daily living prior to the present illness. He had no medical disease and the family history was unremarkable. He was not diagnosed as Behcet s disease, although he sometimes suffered from oral and genital aphthous ulcers in past years. On admission, the vital signs were normal. On physi- cal examination, he had multiple oral aphthous ulcers and genital ulcers with erythema nodosum on both lower extrem- ities. Neurological examination revealed prominent recent memory disturbance without focal neurological deficits. Rou- tine laboratory test, including blood chemistry, electrolyte and urine analysis were normal. Serum VDRL, TPHA and anti-HIV antibody were negative. The thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were normal. HLA typing was positive for HLA-B51. Skin pathergy test was nega- tive. Cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed lymphocyte pleocytosis (30mm? lymphocytes) and an elevated protein content (43 mg/dL) . Biopsy findings on a genital ulcerative lesion revealed chronic ulcer with underlying vasculitis and intradermal lymphocytic infiltration (Fig. 1) . Brain MRI performed 5 days after the onset of symptoms revealed increased signal intensity in right anterior thala- mus, left basal ganglia and left hippocampal area with fluid attenuated inversion recovery images, and small nodular rim enhancements in the right anterior thalamus and left basal ganglia on Tl-weighted image (Fig. 2A) . The patient under- went formal neuropsychological tests 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The patient scored 25/30 (2 percentile) on mini- mental state examination and the subscore on time orientation was 2/5, while the delayed word recall was 1/3. He scored in the normal range on attention tests, digit span and letter can- Fig. 1. Biopsy finding on genital ulcerative lesion.

His performance on copying the intersecting pentagon test and Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure test was normal. On the Hopkins verbal learning test, he was able to recall 14 items (6 percentile) in three consecutive imme- diate recall trials, but there was nil (<1 percentile) 20-min delayed recall. He had poor visual memory score of 8/36 (8 percentile) on delayed recall of the Rey Osterrieth Com- plex Figure test. There was a minimal retrograde amnesia on the autobiographical memory interview. The Korean Famous Events Test [15] revealed 25/30 score, which indicated rela- tively well preserved in retrograde memory. During hospitalization, prednisolone 60 mg/day was started and slowly tapered to 20 mg/day, and then maintained for several months in the outpatient clinic. His memory dys- function was significantly improved after steroid therapy. The follow-up neuropsychological test performed 5 months after onset showed a modest improvement of score on verbal and Fig. 2. Initial and follow-up brain MRI findings in patient.

On the Hopkins verbal learning test he scored 16 items (16 percentile) in three consecutive imme- diate recall trials, and scored 3 items (4 percentile) at the 20-min delayed recall trial. He had a 14/36 score (40 per- centile) on delayed recall of the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure test. Follow-up brain MRI performed 5 months after onset revealed significantly diminished lesions on fluid atten- uated inversion recovery images and T1-weighted enhanced images (Fig. 2B) . 3. Discussion Our patient showed selective anterograde amnesia with learning difficulty on the neuropsychological test without focal neurological deficits. Although the patient scored 25/30 on the MMSE and had some difficulty on driving, retro- grade amnesia was minimal in our patient. The results of detailed evaluations of his past memory with an autobio- graphical memory interview and The Korean Famous Events Test [15] support a very slight impairment in the knowledge of events over the preceding months and years. Clinical char- acteristics including the symptom triad of Behcet s disease, improvement with steroid therapy and brain MRI findings were compatible with a diagnosis of neuro-Behcet s (NB) disease. Although there are some reports [11, 13, 14] of mem- ory dysfunction in patient with NB, this patient represents, to our knowledge, the first reported case of NB disease with a selective anterograde amnesia and minimal retrograde amne- sia caused by bilateral vasculitic lesions in right anterior thalamus and left hippocampus. Nervous system involvement is one of the most serious manifestations of Behcet disease, as it has a significant impact on the quality of life. Central nervous involvement of NB is usually progressive or relapsing. According to previous reports [11, 13, 14], NB disease is classified by two differ- ent pattern according to the clinical and neuroradiological findings with non-parenchymal and parenchymal involve- ment. The non-parenchymal pattern of NB has the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure, primarily due to a dural sinus thrombosis. In the pattern of parenchymal involve- ment, the pathological process occurs primarily within the brain parenchyma and has a tendency to produce focal lesions in the brainstem, basal ganglia, diencephalon, internal cap- sule and cortex. The pathological findings are vasculitis, periventricular inflammation, microglial proliferation and low-grade inflammation [16, 17]. The parenchymal CNS involvement cases of NB showed a variety of focal neurolog- ical deficits, such as pyramidal signs, hemiparesis, gradual behavioral changes, sphincter disturbance and brainstem signs. Among patients, moderate to severe diffuse memory disturbances occurred frequently, but selective anterograde amnesia was not reported. In memory dysfunction, learn- ing and recall functions were equally impaired on both verbal and visual tasks. Attention deficit and frontal exec- utive dysfunction were the second and third most common abnormalities. Orientation, language, visuospatial functions, abstraction and problem-solving abilities were relatively pre- served [11, 13, 14]. The hippocampus plays a key role in the formation of new memory and the anterior thalamus also has an impor- tant role as a component of the Papez circuit [18], which is composed of the hippocampus, fornix, mamillary body, mamillo-thalamic tract, anterior thalamus and cingulated gyrus. In this patient, selective anterograde amnesia was probably caused by direct involvement of hippocampus with left medial temporal lesion and interruption of the Papez circuit with the right anterior thalamic lesion. Our patient showed an incomplete recovery but there was significant improvement in memory assessment following immunosup- pressant treatment. The residual memory deficits can perhaps be explained by remnant bilateral lesions in anterior thalamus and hippocampus.

        "case_report": "Brain (1992) , 115, 1827-1847 AMNESIA FOLLOWING A DISCRETE BASAL FOREBRAIN LESION by MARY K. MORRIS, '? DAWN BOWERS, '? ANJAN CHATTERJEE! and KENNETH M. HEILMAN!? (From the Center for Neuropsychological Studies, the *Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, University of Florida College of Medicine and the *Neurology Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Gainesville, USA) SUMMARY Destructive lesions of the basal forebrain are associated with memory impairment in both humans and experimental animals. The basal forebrain is thought to contribute to memory function by providing cholinergic innervation to critical memory structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala. In previously reported clinical cases of basal forebrain amnesia, multiple neuroanatomical regions have been damaged, preventing identification of the minimal critical lesion necessary to produce an amnestic syndrome. We describe a patient who developed persistent, global anterograde and retrograde amnesia following resection of a low-grade glioma. Post-surgical magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a small discrete lesion, centred in the right diagonal band of Broca, that included the preoptic area, the anterior hypothalamus, the lamina terminalis and the paraterminal gyrus. The septal nuclei and the cel! bodies of the nucleus basalis of Meynert appeared to have been spared, as were other structures in the medial temporal lobe and diencephalon. Our case provides critical support for the independent contribution of the basal forebrain, in particular the diagonal band nuclei, in memory function. We propose that our patient s amnesia resulted from disconnection of pathways between the diagonal band nuclei and the hippocampal region, depriving therapy in Alzheimer s patients have met with limited success (Bartus et al. , 1985) . The earliest descriptions of human amnesia following focal damage to the basal forebrain region involved patients who had undergone surgical repair of anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms (Lindqvist and Norlen, 1966; Talland er al. , 1967; Gade, 1982; Volpe and Hirst, 1983; Alexander and Freedman, 1984; Damasio et al. , 1985; Viikki, 1985; Phillips et al. , 1987; Parkin et al. , 1988) . Striking similarities in clinical presentation occur across these independent reports. These patients exhibited an anterograde amnesia that was severe and typically chronic. Immediate memory was intact. Significant personality changes were described ranging from diminished motivation and apathy to emotional lability, irritability, aggression and social impropriety. Many of these patients exhibited bizarre and fantastic confabulation. Temporal memory deficits were frequently noted. An array of associated frontal cognitive deficits were docu- mented, including impaired abstract reasoning/problem solving, increased distractibility and susceptibility to interference, decreased cognitive flexibility, decreased word fluency, and failure to employ semantic encoding strategies. Finally, hypothalamic dysfunction (i. e. diabetes insipidus) was a frequent complication, since the ACoA circulation includes the anterior hypothalamus. The pathological anatomy in the ACoA cases has varied considerably. Multiple neuroanatomical regions are typically affected, given this particular vascular aetiology. The commonly damaged territory includes orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex, parts of the ventral striatum (i. e. nucleus accumbens) , anterior hypothalamus, and several basal forebrain structures (i. e. the diagonal band nuclei, nucleus basalis of Meynert and septal nuclei) . In addition, several important white matter pathways project through this region, including the medial forebrain bundle, the precommissural fornix, and the anterior commissure (Damasio et al. , 1985) . Thus, in the vast majority of previously reported cases, both basal forebrain structures and posterior ventromedial frontal cortex have SIOZ TT 19q0190 UO eITENSNY YNOS Jo AjISIAAIUE SIOpUIp] Iv /S10\"seuolps0j xo uresg//: dyY WoIy pepeopUMog BASAL FOREBRAIN AMNESIA 1829 been involved. Consequently, the single critical lesion necessary to produce an amnestic syndrome has remained elusive. The basal forebrain has been proposed as the common anatomical denominator in those cases with amnesia (Alexander and Freedman, 1984; Damasio et al. , 1985) , but there have been no reported cases in which damage was confined to this region. Associated damage to frontal cortex might also contribute to amnesia, to an unknown degree (Petrides, 1989) . In monkeys, lesions that included orbital and medial frontal regions produced a delayed recognition deficit comparable in severity to the deficits of monkeys with bilateral combined amygdala and hippocampal lesions (Bachevalier and Mishkin, 1986) . The relative contribution of distinct regions within the basal forebrain also remains unknown. Mesulam et al. (1983) have described the distinct cytoarchitecture and pattern of connectivity associated with four regions of the basal forebrain: the medial septal, the vertical limb of the diagonal band, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Damage to the septal region and/or the vertical limb of the diagonal band might be sufficient to produce amnesia, since these structures are the primary source of cholinergic input to the hippocampus. We report on a patient with a discrete, nonvascular lesion, restricted to the basal forebrain, who presented acutely with a profound global amnesia. His memory disturbance remained severe 18 mths after surgery. Personality changes similar to those reported in ACoA patients were present. Cognitive deficits associated with frontal lobe dysfunction were present acutely but largely resolved, leaving a nearly pure amnesia. PATIENT Case report S. J. was a 51-yr-old, right-handed, white man with a 25-yr history of poorly controlled complex partial seizures (20-25 seizures/month) . A variety of pharmacological regimens had been unsuccessful in providing adequate contro]. Previous computerized tomography (CT) scans had been normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, carried out for the first time during routine follow-up, revealed a smail mass lesion, consistent with a low-grade glioma. It was located near the posterior extent of the gyrus rectus, in the lamina terminalis, abutting the septum and superior to the optic chiasm. An electroencephalogram (EEG) performed at that time was abnormal, with bitemporal sharp wave discharges occurring inde- pendently on the two sides. He was hospitalized on September 15, 1989, for surgical resection of the tumour. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, managed with Capoten. S. J. had two mild closed head injuries, both involving brief loss of consciousness. In 1988, he was involved in an automobile accident resulting in head trauma and subsequent attention/memory problems of approximately 2 3 wks in duration. A previous closed head injury, with no reported cognitive sequelae, occurred at age 17 yrs when S. J. was hit by a baseball. There was no past history of psychiatric disturbance or alcohol or drug abuse. S. J. had a Masters degree in education and was employed as an assistant principal of a middle school for 6 yrs prior to surgery. He taught science for approximately 20 yrs prior to this promotion. Surgical report Surgical resection of the mass lesion was approached from the right frontotemporal region. The right sylvian fissure was split from the temporal tip to a point approximately |. 5 inches posterior to the tip. The temporal lobe was retracted in a posterior inferior direction. The fronta! lobe was retracted progressively in a superior direction until the optic chiasm was visualized, allowing access to the tumour. A mass of SIOZ TT 2990190 UO eTTe.

RESULTS Neuroanatomical localization Post-surgical MRI scan revealed a small discrete lesion predominantly confined to the basal forebrain and primarily to the right of midline (Fig. 1) . The MRI was rated independently by two neurologists, one of whom was blind to this patient s identity and history. Raters were asked to map the lesion onto two schematic coronal sections from a neuroanatomic atlas (DeArmond et al. , 1976) (see Figs 2, 3) . Raters also indicated which of a list of neuroanatomical structures were damaged by the lesion and nominated any additional anatomical areas involved. Inter-rater agreement was extremely high, consistently localizing the lesion to the following structures in and adjacent to the basal forebrain: the diagonal band of Broca, the anterior hypothalamus, the preoptic area, the paraterminal gyrus and the lamina terminalis. One of the two raters felt that the anterior commissure, the nucleus accumbens and the precommissural fornix were partially involved. Involvement of the nucleus basalis of Meynert was rated as minimal by both raters due to the medial location of the lesion. TI+. septal nuclei were not included by either rater. Critical memory structures in the medial temporal lobe and diencephalon were not damaged. Orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex were also spared.

K. MORRIS AND OTHERS Post-surgical course Immediately post-surgery, S. J. was disoriented, agitated and combative. Diabetes insipidus was present. Over 3 d his orientation improved, although alternating periods of agitation and lethargy persisted. No sensory or motor deficits were observed during the postoperative period. S. J. was first seen by the Behavioural Neurology service on September 20, 1989, 5 d post-surgery. Mental status examination revealed a patient who was alert and oriented to person and place, but not date. He reported the year as 1978 and stated that the President was Jimmy Carter. His recall of remote personal history was spared. Language comprehension and expression were intact. S. J. was able to repeat seven digits and perform serial subtractions without difficulty. Although his head was shaven and bandaged, he asked when his surgery was scheduled and continued to ask that question repeatedly over the next 10 d of hospitalization. S. J. never recognized any of the clinicians involved in his care during this hospitalization. Increased irritability, emotional lability and inappropriate jocularity were observed relative to premorbid functioning. Confabulation was also present. S. J. would frequently assert recognition of hospital staff and then confabulate the context, e. g. I had dinner with you last night . When reminded of his surgery, he acknowledged that he had had some recent surgery for other medical problems and that he was still waiting for the tumour resection to take place. When asked why his hair had been shaved, he stated that he and his brother had gone to Deland, Florida the day before and gotten a bad haircut . Confabulatory responses resolved over the 19-d post-surgical hospitaliza- tion. S. J. was discharged to the care of his family on October 4, 1989, with profound amnesia and personality change. S. J. was subsequently seen as an outpatient in our Memory Disorders Clinic for a 6-wk follow-up. He had been seizure-free since the surgery. Post-surgical diabetes insipidus had resolved. Severe amnesia persisted. Although the patient stated that, They tel! me I had surgery for a brain tumour , he was unsure of his age, stating that he was 50, or maybe 51 . He recalled none of three objects at 5 min. He did not appear to appreciate the extent of his impairment and made no attempt to use mnemonic strategies during the examination. His wife reported increased emotional lability and irritability as well as diminished initiative and motivation. S. J. s wife also reported that he appeared to have difficulty distinguishing dreams from reality and vice versa. He occasionally told her that he had dreamed a specific event, when in fact this event had actually occurred. He also reportedly woke from dreams and believed that they were real events. On one occasion, after dreaming that he had been bitten by a poisonous snake, the patient s wife had to seek the help of neighbours to calm the patient. He was convinced that this had actually occurred and was demanding to be taken to the hospital. S. J. s irritability escalated over the first three post-surgical months, resulting in an inpatient psychiatric admission in response to both aggressive outbursts and self-destructive threats. Neurovegetative symptoms of depression were not observed during this hospitalization. Electroencephalography revealed slowing with intermittent sharp-wave activity over the right anterior and midfrontal regions. At that time, Tegretol was added to the patient s regimen, with subsequent tapering and discontinuation of Dilantin. However, significant improvement in affective control and stability did not occur until S. J. began a trial of Inderal as an outpatient.

J. s family members reported diminished irritability and increased apathy and amotivational behaviour. During the examination, S. J. was cooperative and somewhat jocular and sarcastic, but not notably inappropriate. Severe memory impairment persisted. S. J. was aware of his memory deficits but did not show an appropriate level of concern about his situation. He did not report depressive symptoms. Neuropsychological assessment Formal neuropsychological testing was performed several times over an 18-mth period. S. J. was evaluated during the immediate post-surgical hospitalization and at 6 wks, 4 mths, 9 mths and 18 mths post-surgery. Here the focus will be on the initial post-surgical presentation and the 18 mth follow-up, as these two evaluations were the most comprehensive (see Tables | and 2) . Post-surgical assessment. This evaluation took place over a 2-wk period while S. J. was hospitalized. He was alert and oriented to person and place throughout this assessment. He reported the year and month as 1978 or 1979 initially, but began to show inconsistent reporting of the correct year and month near the end of the hospitalization. His cooperation was variable due to intermittent irritability. A complete intellectual assessment could not be obtained at this time, due to his emotional lability and intermittent episodes of hypernatraemia. S. J. s prorated verbal IQ on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1981) fell within the normal range. He exhibited mild word-finding difficulties and moderate slowing bilaterally in fine motor speed and dexterity. Performance on several measures of frontal lobe function was significantly impaired with the exception of a flawless performance on a Go/No Go task (Luria, 1966) . Performance on all other neuropsychological measures fell within the expected range (see Table 1) . Formal memory assessment was consistent with a profound anterograde amnesia. S. J. obtained a Memory Quotient of 74 on the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1945) . He was able to recall six digits forward and five digits backward, indicating an intact immediate attention span. Although he was able to learn five out of six of easy paired associates, S. J. was unable to learn any of the difficult word pairs (0 out of 4) . Recall of the Logical Memory stories from the Wechsler Memory Scale was three items immediately but zero after a 30-min interval. S. J. denied any overt recognition that these stories had been previously presented. S. J. was similarly impaired on a word list learning task (Delis et al. , 1987) , recalling no more than seven of the 16 words on a single trial. His performance was characterized by numerous perseverative and intrusive errors. He did not use semantic information to facilitate his recall. His recall of the word list dropped to zero after performing a single trial of a new list and after a 30-min delay he had no recall of ever hear- ing a word list. Although S. J. indicated recognition of 15 out of 16 words presented in a yes/no recognition paradigm, he also exhibited an extremely high rate of false positive responses. S. J. also exhibited significant impairment of nonverbal recent memory. On the Visual Reproduction portion of the Wechsler Memory Scale he obtained an immediate recall score of 3 and had no recall of the designs after a 30-min delay.

In contrast, his performance on the Milner (1968) facial recognition task was at the lower end of the normal range. A significant disturbance of remote memory for both semantic and personal episodic information was also evident. S. J. s performance on the recall portion of the Public Events Test from the Boston Retrograde Amnesia Examination (Albert et al. , 1979) was severely impaired (8% correct) .

Similar scores were obtained on an analogous remote memory test designed to cover events of the 1970s (D. Bowers and M. Verfaellie, 1987, unpublished test) . S. J. also exhibited a limited period of retrograde amnesia for events prior to his hospitalization. With the help of family SIOZ TT 49q0100 UO eITRNSNY YNOS Jo AyISIOATU_ SJOpUT, ] We /310 speuMolpr0; xo\" uIeIG//: dyY WO peprojuMog 1838 M. K. MORRIS AND OTHERS members, a test of personal autobiographical memory was constructed with questions about significant personal events (e. g. marriage, deaths, children s accomplish- ments) . S. J. was only able to spontaneously recall 50% of these events and recognized only 75% in a multiple choice format. Examination of the temporal pattern of errors suggested that his retrograde amnesia extended inconsistently for 4 5 yrs prior to his surgery. Further investigation of memory function revealed a normal rate of forgetting for verbal material over 48 h, using the paradigm of Huppert and Piercy (1979) . However, encoding difficulties were suggested by his performance on a verbal level-of-processing paradigm in which orthographic, phonemic and semantic cues were used (Craik and Tulving, 1975) . S. J. recalled none of the target words after a 10-min delay. He was able to correctly select 44% of these words in a recognition format but showed no advantage for semantically encoded words. Verbal and nonverbal temporal memory tasks (Bowers ef al. , 1988) were administered to assess S. J. s ability to acquire temporal information about new stimuli. A target list of eight stimuli was initially shown and followed 30 min later by presentation of a second target list of eight different stimuli. Two minutes later a recognition test was given. For the recognition test, the 16 items from the two target lists were randomly intermixed with an equal number of distractors. S. J. was asked to indicate whether each item had been previously seen (Recognition) and, if recognized, whether it had occurred on the first or the second list (Temporal Judgement) . The verbal stimuli consisted of simple declarative sentences; the nonverbal stimuli were unfamiliar faces. Results were suggestive of problems in the time-tagging of new information but could not be confidently interpreted due to significantly impaired recognition of test stimuli (Squire et al. , 1981) and performances on the temporal component of both tasks that fell significantly below chance (verbal: recognition = 66%, temporal judgements = 24%; nonverbal: recognition = 53%, temporal judgements = 0%) . Follow-up assessment. S. J. was assessed at both 9 mths and 18 mths post-surgery. There was no significant change in his performance over this time period. Results of the 18-mth assessment will be described with occasional reference to findings at the 9 mth follow-up (see Tables 1 and 2) . S. J. s performance on measures of intellectual function, attention, language and constructional ability was consistent with the baseline evaluation. However, he exhibited marked improvement in executive or frontal lobe function. With the exception of decreased word fluency on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (Benton and Hamsher, 1978) , S. J. s performance on frontal cognitive tasks had improved to within the normal range. Additional measures, frequently impaired in patients with frontal lobe dysfunction (Leng and Parkin, 1989) , were included in the 9-mth follow-up testing. On a Peterson-Peterson auditory consonant trigrams task (Peterson and Peterson, 1959) , his performance was excellent (see Table 1) . S. J. also evidenced relative sparing of metamemory skills. During the recall portion of the Boston Retrograde Amnesia Examination, he was asked to predict his success in recognizing the correct response in a multiple choice format for those items failed on recall. S. J. predicted correctly 76% of the time. Despite cognitive improvement, personality changes suggestive of frontal dysfunction persisted. SIOZ TT 4990190 UO eTTe. NSNY YINOS Jo AysIOATU_ SIOpUTT Je /S10' sjeunofpsoyxo\"urerg//: dyyy Wor papeopuMog BASAL FOREBRAIN AMNESIA 1839 Although S. J. s Memory Quotient on the Wechsler Memory Scale increased relative to the baseline evaluation (MQ = 96) , significant anterograde amnesia was still evident. He still recalled no information from the Logical Memory stories after a 30-min delay. Visual presentation of the stories resulted in similar performance. In contrast, some improvement was observed in delayed recall of the Visual Reproduction designs, although his performance still fell within the impaired range. S. J. continued to show minimal learning over the five trials of the California Verbal Learning Test. Although slightly improved, his delayed recall was still severely impaired. Interestingly, S. J. showed a significant reduction in both false positive and perseverative errors, while intrusive errors remained high. He also showed significant improvement in his ability to use semantic information to facilitate performance. However, this improvement was not evident on a verbal levels-of-processing task, on which S. J. s performance was unchanged from the post-surgical assessment. Performance on the Rey-Osterreith figure suggested continuing impairment of nonverbal memory in both immediate and delay conditions. S. J. s performance was somewhat better on nonverbal memory tasks that required no constructional output. His score on the Milner facial recognition task remained in the borderline range. The Continuous Visual Memory Test (Trahan and Larrabee, 1988) was given for the first time at the 18 mth follow-up. All scores fell above the recommended cut-off for impairment, although the Delayed Recall score was borderline. Thus, S. J. appeared to perform significantly better on nonverbal recent memory tasks relative to verbal tasks. Remote memory impairment persisted at 18 mths. Although S. J. s recall on the Public Events test improved slightly from baseline, his performance on the recognition portion of this test was unchanged. His performance was also impaired on the Famous Faces portion of the Boston Retrograde Amnesia Examination, administered for the first time at 18 mths. Re-administration of the same personal autobiographical test used at baseline revealed equivalent performance. Again, no temporal gradient was apparent on any of these measures. Thus, there was minimal improvement in S. J. s remote memory impairment at follow-up. DISCUSSION S. J. s clinical presentation was strikingly similar to previously reported cases of amnesia following damage to the basal forebrain and adjacent structures. Since S. J. is most similar to Case | in the series reported by Damasio et a/. (1985) , both in terms of clinical presentation and lesion location, a specific comparison of these cases may be useful. The patient of Damasio et al. (1985) had haematomas in the left gyrus rectus and midline septal nuclei and subsquently underwent surgical clipping of the left anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Both patients exhibited (i) chronic anterograde amnesia that was material and modality nonspecific, (ii) retrograde amnesia for both semantic and personal episodic information, (iii) ability to benefit from cueing in both anterograde and retrograde domains, (iv) personality change characterized by irritability and apathy, (v) confabulation/reality disturbance in the acute phase, (vi) hypothalamic dysfunction and (vii) possible defects in the temporal tagging of information. We did not observe evidence of the mismatch between auditory-verbal and visual memories described by Damasio et al. (1985) . The extent of frontal cognitive SIOZ TT 19q0190 UO eITENSNY YNOS Jo AjISIAAIUE SIOpUIp] Iv /S10\"seuolps0j xo uresg//: dyY WoIy pepeopUMog 1840 M. K. MORRIS AND OTHERS deficits associated with the amnesia cannot be compared in these patients since these neuropsychological measures were not reported by Damasio er al. (1985) , although decreased verbal fluency was reported for both patients. Finally, S. J. s recovery appears to have been less dramatic; unlike Case 1 of Damasio et al. (1985) , he was never able to return to work or to function independently due to the continued severity of his memory impairment. The striking similarity in presentation between these two cases provides further support for the existence of a specific basal forebrain amnestic syndrome. Given that the primary difference between these two cases is the side of lesion, one might infer that the material specificity reported in conjunction with both mesial temporal and diencephalic amnesias is not a feature of basal forebrain amnesia. In fact, as will be discussed further below, S. J. s right-sided lesion was actually associated with somewhat better performance on nonverbal memory tasks. Like previously reported patients with ACoA aneurysms, S. J. exhibited confabulation and abnormalities in the perception of reality during the acute phase. However, the rapid resolution of his confabulation was consistent with the hypothesis that the severity and persistence of confabulation is related to the degree of frontal lobe involvement rather than the degree of memory impairment (Stuss et a/. , 1978; Kapur and Coughlan, 1980; DeLuca, 1991) . The nature and underlying mechanisms of S. J. s unusual disturbance in the perception of reality, in which dreams and waking state events were not clearly distinguished, remains unexplained. A similar phenomena was also described by Whitty and Lewin (1957) in patients who had surgical lesions of the anterior cingulate for treatment of severe obsessional neurosis. Our case demonstrates that this disturbance of reality is not dependent on structural cingulate damage. Whitty and Lewin s patients were completely aware of their difficulties, whereas S. J. , similar to the patients described by Damasio et al. (1985) , was unaware of his reality disturbance. We do not know if this disturbance in the perception of reality persisted beyond the immediate post-surgical period because S. J. was not an accurate reporter of his experiences and his spouse was not available to provide observations. Several aspects of this case are different from previously reported patients with ACoA aneurysms, including Case 1 of Damasio et al. (1985) , and thus provides some unique information about the role of the basal forebrain in memory function. S. J. s lesion is extremely discrete, sparing many regions damaged in previous cases, particularly the ventromedial frontal cortex. The minimal involvement of the frontal cortex is further supported by this patient s normal levels of performance on numerous cognitive tasks sensitive to frontal lobe damage (i. e. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Category Test, Peterson-Peterson paradigm, Luria Recursive Figures, Go/No Go Test, Trails B) . Furthermore, S. J. s lesion does not appear to involve all areas of the basal forebrain. It is centred in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, inferior to the septal nuclei, which appear to be largely spared, and medially to the vast majority of the cell bodies of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Although S. J. s lesion is located almost entirely to the right of midline, examination of his memory performance over time reveals an unexpected, material-related difference, suggestive of better recall of nonverbal material. Since the septal/diagonal band projections to the hippocampus are predominantly ipsilateral (Amaral and Cowan, 1980) , S. J. s SIOZ TT 19q0190 UO eITENSNY YNOS Jo AjISIAAIUE SIOpUIp] Iv /S10\"seuolps0j xo uresg//: dyY WoIy pepeopUMog BASAL FOREBRAIN AMNESIA 1841 lesion should have spared the cholinergic projection to left hippocampus, leading to the opposite prediction regarding material specificity. Thus, his superior recall of nonverbal material is counter to expectation in a patient with presumed normal hemispheric lateralization. S. J. is right-handed with no family history of sinistrality or childhood events that might be associated with anomalous lateralization of cognitive function. His previous closed-head injuries reportedly resulted in minimal and transient cognitive deficits and are thus an unlikely explanation. His premorbid seizure disorder, although longstanding, was of adult onset and thus unlikely to have been associated with anomalous early development. Of course, the possibility of changes in lateralization over the lengthy period of uncontrolled seizure activity cannot be completely ruled out. Unfortunately, direct comparison of performance on standard verbal and nonverbal memory tasks is hindered by the inherent difficulty in ensuring that the tasks are of equivalent difficulty and are equally sensitive to memory impairment. Clearly, S. J. s performance on nonverbal memory tasks is not normal and the difference that we have noted may simply reflect the increased difficulty/sensitivity of the verbal measures. S. J. also clearly exhibited impaired spatial memory in everyday situations (e. g. recalling the location of personal possessions and learning new routes) . Overall, our findings, in conjunction with the findings of Damasio et al. (1985) , raise the possibility that the left and right basal forebrain may be functionally equivalent with regard to memory. It has been quite difficult to ascertain the minimal lesion necessary for the basal forebrain amnestic syndrome, due to the extent and variability of previously reported lesions. Previous authors have pointed out that the common anatomical denominator in all previous cases is the involvement of the basal forebrain region, more specifically, the septal nuclei, the diagonal band of Broca, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and related white matter pathways (Alexander and Freedman, 1984; Damasio et al. , 1985) . Since these structures are the principal origin of cholinergic innervation for other neuroanatomical regions known to be involved in memory (i. e. the hippocampus and the amygdala) , they have been proposed as the critical substrate for amnesia, independent of the frontal cortex. Damage to the basal forebrain has been correlated with diminished medial temporal lobe activity on positron emission tomography (Volpe et al. , 1984) . Patient S. J. provides strong support for this proposal, demonstrating that a lesion restricted to the basal forebrain can produce a severe and chronic amnesia, without apparent differences in presentation from previous cases, except for the absence of prominent frontal cognitive deficits. However, S. J. s lesion raises the possibility that the list of critical structures within the basal forebrain might be further restricted. His lesion does not appear to involve all of the basal forebrain. It is centred in the nucleus of the diagonal band; the septal nuclei anteriorly are not involved, and the cell bodies of the nucleus basalis of Meynert laterally are minimally involved. Our case suggests that a lesion predominantly restricted to the diagonal band nuclei may be sufficient to produce severe amnesia, despite sparing of the septal nuclei, which also provide cholinergic input to the hippocampus. This account is inconsistent with a previously reported animal model of basal forebrain amnesia in which significant memory impairment resulted only when lesions encompassed all three cholinergic regions of the basal forebrain (Aigner et al. , 1984) . Although the boundary between the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band is difficult to define, there is considerable evidence that the two regions S107 TT 49q01909 UO eITeNsNY YNOS Jo AySIOATUA SIOpUIp] J /310 speusnolproy; xouresg//: dyy Wo papeojuMog 1842 M. K. MORRIS AND OTHERS are distinct in cytoarchitecture, neurochemistry and connectivity (Swanson er al. , 1987) . The work of Mesulam et al. (1983) supports the primacy of the vertical limb of the diagonal band in providing cholinergic innervation to the hippocampal formation. Approximately 70% of diagonal band projections to the hippocampus are believed to be cholinergic compared with 10% of medial septal projections (Mesulam e al. , 1983) . Thus, a diagonal band lesion would be most effective in depriving the hippocampus of cholinergic input. The remainder of the diagonal band-hippocampal projections are believed to be GABAergic (Kohler et al. , 1984) . The role that GABAergic afferents to the hippocampus might play in amnesia remains unclear. The hippocampus sends reciprocal projections back to the basal forebrain, primarily to the same regions from which it receives input (Swanson et al. , 1987) . These reciprocal pathways travel through the precommissural fornix. Since S. J. s lesion may also involve the precommisural fornix, it could deprive the hippocampus of its ability to influence the activity of the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Mishkin s model proposes that both the hippocampus and the amygdala must be damaged to produce significant memory impairment (Mishkin, 1982; Mishkin er al. , 1982; Saunders et al. , 1984) . Subsequent investigations, in both the clinical (Graff- Radford et al. , 1990) and experimental animal (Bachevalier et al. , 1985) literature, have extended this model to include disruption of both hippocampal and amygdala connections. S. J. s lesion clearly involves hippocampal pathways. It is likely that it compromises amygdala connectivity as well. The rostral portion of the ventro- amygdalofugal pathway courses through the substantia innominata to reach targets in the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus and prefrontal cortex (Price et al. , 1987) . In monkeys, these amygdala efferents surround the cholinergic nuclei of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the diagonal band and form synapses (Russchen et al. , 1985) . Although the other primary efferent pathway from the amygdala, the stria terminalis, is not likely to be involved, it terminates in the preoptic area (Price et al. , 1987) , which was lesioned in this patient. Even though S. J. s lesion may involve some amygdala efferents, it is unlikely to significantly compromise the cholinergic innervation of the amygdala, which arises primarily from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Amaral, 1987) . Although the hippocampus and the amygdala are both densely interconnected with the basal forebrain, these two circuits do not appear to overlap (Aggleton et al. , 1987; Amaral, 1987) . S. J. s lesion primarily disrupts cholinergic function in the hippocampal circuit, leaving the amygdala-basal forebrain circuit intact. Thus, Mishkin s two-circuit model may not extend to the cholinergic pathways that innervate the two critical structures involved in memory. Our case raises the possibility that disrupting the cholinergic hippocampal circuits alone may be sufficient to produce a dense amnesia. This finding is consistent with the reports of amnesia following selective damage to the CAI hippocampal field bilaterally (Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1986; Zola-Morgan et al. , 1986) . Althougi selective disruption of the cholinergic system may entirely account for our patient s deficits, his lesion involves other structures, interconnected with and immediately adjacent to the nucleus of the diagonal band, that may contribute to his memory impairment and personality change. Some fibres from the nucleus of the diagonal band innervate the anterior cingulate and retrosplenial regions before reaching the hippocampal formation (Swanson er al. , 1987) . Damage to the retrosplenial area was associated with SIOZ TT 49q0190 UO eTPENSNY YINOS Jo AjIsIOATU_ SIOpUTT Iv /S. 10 speUINOlp10jxO'UTeIG//: djJY WO, paprojUMOg BASAL FOREBRAIN AMNESIA 1843 amnesia in a previously reported case (Valenstein er al. , 1987) , and the anterior cingulate plays an important role in emotional responsivity. S. J. s lesion may also have involved the nucleus accumbens, which receives projections from the amygdala and projects to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, thus linking the limbic structures with the basal ganglia (Price et al. , 1987) . S. J. s motivational changes might be related to the involvement of this structure. S. J. s lesion also involved the anterior hypothalamus and the preoptic area. Hormones released by the hypothalamus may play a role in memory (Weingartner et al. , 1981) . There is some evidence that vasopressin acts as a neuromodulator, increasing the responsiveness of the hippocampus and amygdala to noradrenalin (Kovacs et al. , 1979) . The preoptic area is primarily involved in a variety of self-regulatory (e. g. sleep, temperature and osmoregulation) and species-specific (e. g. reproductive, maternal and dominance) behaviours (Swanson, 1987) . The post-surgical diabetes insipidus, decreased sexual interest and early aggressiveness evolving to apathy are likely to be related to damage to these regions. The vivid daydreaming (Whitty and Lewin, 1957) or confusion between dream and waking states exhibited by S. J. loss in target structures for cholinergic projections (i. e. hippocampus and amygdala) , as well as the more widespread cortical atrophy and the progressive course of this disease, place limits on the extent of improvement that might reasonably be anticipated. Our patient may be a more promising candidate for cholinergic therapy. His lesion is discrete and nonprogressive and there is no direct damage to either the medial temporal or diencephalic components of the memory system. Controlled trials of oral physostigmine are in progress. This case provides critical support for the independent contribution of the basal forebrain, in particular the diagonal band nuclei, in memory function. Although other possibilities discussed above cannot be conclusively dismissed, the primary underlying aetiology of this patient s amnesia is likely to be the disconnection of critical bidirectional S107 TT 49q01909 UO eITeNsNY YNOS Jo AySIOATUA SIOpUIp] J /310 speusnolproy; xouresg//: dyy Wo papeojuMog 1844 M. K. MORRIS AND OTHERS connections between the diagonal band nuclei and the hippocampal region and the consequent deprivation of the hippocampus of its primary cholinergic innervation, as well as its ability to exert reciprocal influence on the basal forebrain cholinergic system. In effect, such a lesion would result in the neurochemical (i. e. cholinergic) isolation of the hippocampus, analogous to the isolation of the hippocampus by neuronal degeneration in entorhinal cortex, described in Alzheimer s disease (Hyman et al. , 1984) . Our case suggests that isolating the hippocampus from the cholinergic basal forebrain also has a devastating effect on Amnesic syndromes after surgery of anterior communicating artery aneurysms.

        "other": "the hippocampus of cholinergic innervation. INTRODUCTION The amnesic syndrome has been primarily associated with damage to three relatively discrete neuroanatomical regions: (i) the medial temporal lobes (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Milner, 1970; Smith, 1989) ; (ii) the medial thalamic nuclei (Teuber et al. , 1968; Squire and Moore, 1979; Markowitsch, 1982; Butters and Stuss, 1989; Graff-Radford et al. , 1990) ; (iii) the basal forebrain (Damasio er al. , 1985, 1989) ; although other regions may also contribute to memory function, e. g. the fornix (Heilman and Sypert, 1977; Grafman et al. , 1985; Gaffan et al. , 1991) , the mamillary bodies (Mair et al. , 1979; Dusoir et al. , 1990) , the retrosplenial cortex (Valenstein et al. , 1987) and possibly the frontal cortex (Petrides, 1989) . The basal forebrain is thought to contribute to memory function by providing cholinergic innervation to critical memory structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as to most of the neocortex. The cholinergic structures of the basal forebrain include the septal nuclei (lateral and medial) , the nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca (vertical and horizontal) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. There is substantive evidence that the cholinergic system is the primary neuro- chemical mediator of memory (Drachman and Leavitt, 1974; Bartus et al. , 1985; Correspondence to: Dr Mary K. Morris, Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, University Plaza, Atlanta, GA 30303-3083, USA.

Administration of the anticholinergic agent, scopolamine, produces memory impairment in healthy individuals (Ghoneim and Mewaldt, 1977) . This effect can be attenuated by administration of physostigmine, an anticholinesterase inhibitor (Drachman and Leavitt, 1974; Ghoneim and Mewaldt, 1977) . Destructive lesions of cholinergic neurons are associated with memory loss in both experimental animals and humans. Monkeys with lesions involving basal forebrain structures are severely impaired on a delayed recognition task (Aigner et al. , 1984) . Rats with spatial memory deficits related to aging show significantly decreased levels of choline acetyltransferase in the basal forebrain (Gallagher er al. , 1990) . Grafts of foetal septal tissue into the hippocampal formation of aged rats have resulted in exten- sive growth of acetylcholinesterase-positive terminals in conjunction with improved performance on a spatial memory task (Gage et al. , 1984) . Patients with Alzheimer s disease who have progressive memory disturbance exhibit significant neuronal atrophy in the basal forebrain (Whitehouse et al. , 1981) . Basal forebrain neuronal loss has also been reported in other clinical populations with amnestic features such as alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome (Arendt er a/. , 1983; Butters, 1985) and Parkinson s disease with coexisting dementia (Whitehouse er al. , 1983) . However, the presence of more extensive neuronal degeneration in these patients makes it difficult to connect the memory disturbance to a specific anatomical location. Furthermore, clinical studies of the efficacy of cholinergic replacement and other reported cases, may also be related to preoptic/hypothalamic damage. Howeve7, the preoptic area s rich pattern of connectivity suggests that it may play a significant role in cognitive function (Swanson, 1987) . It receives inputs from both the amygdala and the hippocampus. The septal/diagonal band region, locus ceruleus, midbrain raphe and ventral tegmental area all project here and ascend via the median forebrain bundle to cortical regions. Extensive hypothalamic inputs have also been identified. Many of these projections are reciprocal. Thus, this region is capable of influencing and being influenced by all types of sensory input, hippocampal information processing, and autonomic nervous system activity, as well as by those regions that are the primary source of major neurotransmitters (i. e. noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic) . The preoptic area s potential contribution to memory function remains to be elucidated. Increasing empirical support for the cholinergic s system role in memory (Bartus ef al. , 1985; Kopelman, 1986) , in conjunction with evidence of significant loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain region in patients with Alzheimer s disease (Whitehouse et al. , 1981) , led to a series of clinical trials of cholinergic augmentation therapy in Alzheimer patients (Davis and Mohs, 1982; Peters and Levin, 1982; Johns er al. , 1983; Thal et al. , 1983; Mohs et al. , 1985) . Although some studies demonstrated moderate improvement in memory in a subset of patients, in general, the results have been disappointing. The presence of significant cell memory function.

Pellegrino, Bergamo, Italy 3Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy 4Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy This paper reports the case of a patient, M. P. , who developed delusion of inanimate doubles, without Capgras syndrome, after traumatic brain injury. His delusional symptoms were studied longitudinally and the cognitive impairments associated with delusion were investigated. Data suggest that M. P. did perceive the actual differences between doubles and originals rather than confabulate them. The cognitive profile, characterized by retrograde episodic amnesia, but neither object processing impairment nor confabulations, supports this hypothesis. The study examines the nature of object misidentification based on Ellis and Staton s account and proposes a new account based on concurrent unbiased retrieval of semantic memory traces and biased recollection of episodic memory traces. Keywords: Delusion of inanimate doubles; Misidentification of inanimate objects; Misidentification syndrome; Capgras; Retrograde amnesia. Delusion of inanimate doubles (DID) defines cases in which the patient labors under the false belief that an inanimate object has been substituted by an identical duplicate (Anderson & Williams, 1994) . This phenomenon is included among the Delusional Misidentification Syndromes (DMS) , together with other conditions in which patients misidentify animals (a dog, Wright, Mindham, & Burn, 1994; a cat, Reid, Young, & Hellawell, 1993; a canary, Rosler, Holder, & Seifritz, 2001) , people (Capgras s delusion, CD: Capgras & Reboul-Lachaux, 1923) , parts of the body includ- ing organs (Weinstein, Kahn, Malitz, & Rozanski, 1954) , events, places, or complex entities such as towns or buildings (Reduplicative paramnesia, RP: Pick, 1903) . Along with the abnormal belief that a person, usually a close relative, has been replaced by a double (CD) , delusional misidentification of per- sons includes recognizing an acquaintance in some- one who does not show any obvious physical resem- blance to that acquaintance (Fr goli s delusion: Courbon & Fail, 1927) , the belief that others have Address correspondence to Carlo Abbate, Day Hospital di Geriatria, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Via Pace 9, 20122 Milano, Italy.

However, inter- preting DID purely as misidentification is dis- putable and accounts of this type are challenged in this paper. In a review of 138 DMS cases Anderson and Williams (1994) reported that 7. 2% suffered from DID. In some cases DID was the only delusional symptom present (e. g. , Abed & Fewtrell, 1990; Ellis et al. , 1996) , while in others it was associated with another delusional form, usually Capgras syn- drome: for instance, Berson (1983) , Kimura (1986) , and Anderson and Williams (1994) reported DID in 5 14% of Capgras syndrome cases. DID may emerge in patients suffering from psy- chiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Enoch & Trethowan, 1979; Ellis et al. , 1996) , depres- sion (Coleman, 1933; Courbon & Tusques, 1932) , substance-induced psychotic disorders (Silva & Leong, 1995) , short-lived acute psychotic episodes (Abed & Fewtrell, 1990) , or organic brain dis- eases such as pituitary tumors (Anderson, 1988) , in epilepsy (Nejad & Toofani, 2006) , and in strokes (Ellis et al. , 1996) . Table 1 summarizes the principal case descriptions of selective DID reported in the literature. Only two of the DID cases listed in Table 1 were supported with data documenting a careful investigation of the cognitive functions. Abed and Fewtrell (1990) carried out a neuropsychological assessment including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Kendrick Battery, and the visual functions section of the Luria- Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery on their patient Mrs. S. , who showed no deterioration of intelligence (WAIS QI = 104) , had preserved verbal and visual recall, normal visual memory for objects and a normal performance on visuo-spatial and spatial orientation tasks. The authors considered this positive neuropsychological performance as evidence of the absence of organic brain damage. On the contrary, Ellis et al. (1996) found that the selective DID for non-living items shown by their two patients was associated with poor per- formance on object-processing tasks, such as the recognition of unfamiliar houses and the identifi- cation of famous buildings, while they performed unexpectedly well on face processing tasks, such as recognition of unfamiliar faces and identifi- cation of celebrities. The authors concluded that these results, and the observation of CD patients with no DID but who exhibited impaired face processing abilities (Bidault, Lulaut , & Tzavaras, 1986; Schraberg & Weitzel, 1979; Young, Reid, Wright, & Hellawell, 1993) and preserved memory of non-facial stimuli such as complex visual pat- terns and words (Mackie, Ebmeier, & O Connell, 1994) , indicate a double dissociation between (cog- nitive) impairments specific to DID and CD (p. 35) (Figure 1) . They proposed an explanation for the DID syndrome based on Ellis and Young s (1990) account of CD: according to Bauer s (1984) dual- pathway model of face recognition, the dorsal route is impaired or disconnected, while the ventral route is preserved. The latter route permits conscious face recognition (overt recognition) , while the former provides the emotional connotations (covert recog- nition) . CD patients misidentify a relative because while their cognitive system is still able to process the identity of the face, they cannot retrieve the emotional support for recognition. This cognitive conflict causes the patient to believe that the person is an impostor or a double of their original relative. Ellis et al. (1996) offered the same account to explain the DID syndrome. Patients have developed their delusions about objects having been replaced because there has been a loss in the normal con- current sense of personal significance (. . . ) (p. 37) . The authors underlined that delusional thinking also requires a state of suspicion which distorts attributional and judgmental processes. Staton, Brumback, and Wilson (1982) proposed a different explanation of the delusional syndromes based on impairment of the memory processes. The patients memory system effectively registers new information but fails to integrate it with past memo- ries, so that pre-morbid memories are not updated. The patient compares his/her perception of faces, places, or objects with old memories which then appear to be different from the originals. Ellis et al. (1996) rejected Staton et al. s (1982) explanation of DID because this fails to account for those minor- ity instances in the literature where the duplicated objects seem newer and better (p. 37) . In their opin- ion, Staton et al. s (1982) hypothesis would predict a direction of differences: duplicates should always appear older and more worn than the originals. According to the Dual-Process Model of Recognition Memory (Gardiner & Richardson- Klavehen, 2000) , recognition can be mediated by two different memory processes: recollection and eANdeIas Jo sodas ase, baTavi PLOT JOQuIDDIG ZZ 96: 80 Ie [AIISIOATUA, WIO}SOMYLION] Aq popropumog Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 460 ABBATE ETAL. 100, ~ - Hellis, 1996: case MY - Hellis, 1996: case BK -O- Mackie, 1994 754 504 Percent correct 254 Faces Object Figure 1.

During the processing of stimuli in a recognition situation, the recollection process is responsible for a cued recall of stimuli-associated information, while the familiarity process leads to a feeling of memory experience without any recall of stimuli-associated information (Mayes, Montaldi, & Migo, 2007) . Both processes are associated with activation in the frontal and parietal brain areas, but recollection involves activation of additional brain regions, including the hippocampus, content sensory regions, the orbitofrontal, superior frontal and right anterior prefrontal cortex (Skinner & Fernandes, 2007) . This additional activity during recollection, especially in the prefrontal cortex, has been interpreted as related to a mechanism of search and monitoring of contextual details (Skinner & Fernandes, 2007) . The DMS are considered pathological conditions of decreased (or increased) familiarity (Devinsky, 2009) . Several neurological patients with delusions described in the literature presented bilateral frontal and right temporo-parietal lesions (Devinsky, 2009; Doran, 1990; Luzzatti & Verga, 1996) . It has been suggested that right temporal lesions impair famil- iarity processing, causing familiar people, places, and body parts to appear foreign, and that the bilat- eral frontal dysfunction impairs the ability to mon- itor the appropriateness of the sense of familiarity emerging from the familiarity processing. This latter dysfunction is critical for the development of delu- sion because it leaves patients without the capac- ity to recognize and correct inaccurate memories resulting from dysfunctional familiarity processing (Devinsky, 2009) . This paper reports the case of a patient (M. P. ) who presented selective DID without any signs of CD for a long period after suffering a traumatic brain injury. For over 1 year M. P. was given neuropsychological evaluations, followed by three clinical interviews. The objectives of this study are: (i) to investi- gate the phenomenology of delusional symptoms; (ii) to characterize the cognitive neuropsychological profile in a case of DID; (iii) to verify double dis- sociation processing impairments on faces versus objects between CD and DID cases, predicted by Ellis et al. (1996) ; and (iv) to discuss a possible explanation for DID, based on the association of the two accounts offered by Ellis et al. (1996) and Staton et al. (1982) . CASE REPORT At the time of evaluation M. P. was 38 years old, a qualified mechanic, and prior to the severe closed head injury sustained in a car accident in May 1998, he had his own business. He was right handed and had obtained a diploma from the technical high school. On admission to hospital following the acci- dent he was rated 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Within three and a half months after the accident he reportedly fully recovered his consciousness deficits. A neurological examination revealed right hemi- paresis, limb ataxia, and signs of reactive depres- sion; a neuropsychological screening revealed a dysexecutive syndrome, with episodes of behav- ioral dishinibition. M. P. was given physiotherapy and cognitive training for about | month, after which his motor and cognitive functions had almost returned to normal. When M. P. was discharged, he had mild right hemiparesis with independent walk- ing, right upper limb clumsiness, and mild ataxia; his dysexecutive disorders had greatly improved. He now lives with his parents, but maintains a good level of autonomy in his daily life. He drives a car, plays ping-pong, watches go-kart races, takes a swimming course, and has a part-time job as a secretary. During two routine follow-up examina- tions in January and October 2000, he underwent neuropsychological testing. This confirmed a pre- served and stable global cognitive performance, but revealed a slight verbal short-term memory deficit, cerebellar dysarthria, behavioral traits of adynamic, disinhibited, and dysexecutive frontal syndrome. The first report of delusional symptoms was made by M. P. s relatives in autumn 2001; he had started complaining that his car and some of his personal belongings, such as his wedding ring and his watch, were no longer as they used to be. He was convinced that someone had switched them with inferior Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 copies, and this irritated him greatly. He also became suspicious, and showed some aggressive verbal reactions. Contemporaneously, his behavior became evidently adynamic, with reduced interest, emotional flattening, lack of initiative, and depres- sive symptoms. He also experienced d ja-vu phenomena, report- ing double occurrences of the same experience, such as purchasing something at the market, watching the same TV program, or the same go-kart race twice over. He reported d jd-vu for the first time in 1999, about | year after the TBI, and it was the sec- ond most frequent symptom associated with DID during the entire follow-up phase. The DID syndrome itself became evident in 2001, after M. P. obtained a new driving license and bought a new car, a different model from his previ- ous one which had been destroyed in the accident. From that point on, DID was particularly evident during the entire period of investigation, without however any instances of CD. A CT-scan performed 24 hours after the TBI did not show any focal or diffuse brain damage, but 1 month later, in June 1998, a brain MRI high- lighted a small circumscribed lesion of the right temporal polar cortex and bilateral frontal hygro- mata (Figure 2) . The same examination performed in May 1999, | year after the TBI, documented a relative re-absorption of the bilateral frontal hygromata, and confirmed the right temporal polar lesion. It also documented diffuse post-traumatic atrophy. DELUSIONAL SYMPTOMS The aim of this section of the paper is to describe the DID symptoms and their evolution during the follow-up period. The analysis is based on three semi-structured, open question inter- views. Interviews were held at 3-month intervals (December 2004, March 2005, and July 2005) and were tape-recorded and transcribed (see Appendix) . The main topics investigated were (i) substituted objects; (ii) differences between the originals and the substitutes; (iii) M. P. s reaction to misidentifi- cations; (iv) the persons suspected as being respon- sible for the substitution; and (v) accounts given of substitution. M. P. was asked for, and gave, his informed consent before testing and interviewing. (i) The replaced objects M. P. reported 29 substitutions of inanimate objects, of which 19 were parts of his car (see Appendix: MISIDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS 461 11-13, 21, 22, 30, 34) , while the remaining 10 were personal belongings (his wedding-ring, his watch, his sun-glasses, his cellular phone, etc. ) , clothing (sneakers, a track-suit, a t-shirt, trousers, slippers, etc. ) and the chair in front of his desk. M. P. was very consistent, citing the same objects in differ- ent interviews (see for example the tires: 11, 31, 37; or the gearshift: 13, 28, 37) : he spontaneously reported 10 objects on more than one occasion (Table 2) . (ii) Differences between originals and substitutes In general, M. P. was able to highlight the dif- ference between the substituted objects and the originals (23 objects out of 29) . The differences were always concrete and referred to physical or functional aspects (see Appendix: 13-15, 21, 22, 30-32, 35-37) . Delusional beliefs were always plau- sible and never bizarre or absurd. He hesitated on the description or was unable to report the object changes in only a few cases (see for example the steering wheel, 35) . The same differences between originals and substitutes were reported during the interviews (see for example the gearshift: 13, 29, 37; or the ventilation system: 22, 36) . Most of the substitutes were of an inferior quality with respect to the originals, but at least four were of the same quality (e. g. , the dashboard, cellular phone, glove compartment, cellular phone holder) and in one case, the tires, the quality had improved (11, 32, 37) . In this case there is concrete evidence that M. P. did in fact experience a real, objective difference. When he complained that his car tires had been replaced, his father denied that the tires had been substituted but acknowledged that the tires had been turned, i. e. , they had been moved into different positions in order to wear-out the treads uniformly and so the less worn sides were then visible. (iii) M. P. s reactions to the misidentifications M. P. s belief that his belongings had been replaced was firm and unshakable (see Appendix: 8, 20, 25) , and his delusions regarding the substitution of the car parts were reinforced by the fact that he had been a highly experienced mechanic. M. P. said that the substitutions were of objects of which he was fond, and was distressed and became annoyed about the replacements (18, 32) . However, in spite of that, he accepted the substitutions passively without demanding any explanation (6, 18, 20) , his main concern being that the substitutions would work properly (20) .

Brain MRI of the patient one month after traumatic brain injury shows (A) a small circular lesion in the right temporal pole (left side in figure) and (B) bilateral frontal hygromata. Right temporal polar lesion (C) without bilateral frontal hygromata (D) was still visible in the brain MRI performed one year after traumatic brain injury. (E) The corresponding anatomical templates were arrayed using the MRIcro program (http: //www. sph. sc. edu//comd/rorden/) : the templates suggest (voxel analysis) that the lesion primarily affects the parahippocampal areas and marginally affects the amygdala and the superior temporal pole.

This suspicion substitutions appeared to be based more on reasoning than on a persecution complex or irrational thinking; he In general, M. P. did not know whom to blame for said that only a mechanic could have made those the substitutions (see Appendix: 7, 20) . Sometimes replacements (10) and that only his friend had given he alluded to a number of people (6) and suspected the car a check-up while he was hospitalized.

P. s explanation for the substitutions M. P. was convinced that he was the victim of a prank, rather than of a conspiracy. He believed that the pranks would soon cease and his orig- inal belongings would be returned to him (see Appendix, 20) . However, he was not clear about the reason for the pranks. Most of the differences reported by M. P. could be ascribed to normal wear and tear, e. g. , the engine had become less powerful and therefore burned more petrol, the safety belts had hardened, the air conditioning was less power- ful, the body paint had lost its shine. However, his answers suggested that he perceived these changes as being too radical (17) and happening too sud- denly (26) , and he explicitly refuted the explanation of normal wear and tear. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION Global assessment A neuropsychological follow-up was carried out over 14 months, starting from December 2004, about 7 years post injury (Table 3) . Global cog- nitive functioning, measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) , and general intellectual func- tions, tested with the Raven s Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1984) , were preserved. Executive functions were slightly impaired. In particular, M. P. had some difficulty with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Laiacona, Inzaghi, De Tanti, & Capitani, 2000) and his performance was impaired ona verbal phonological fluency task (Novelli et al. , ee eR RR Oe 1986a) , on non-verbal planning tasks (Elithorn s Perceptual Maze Test, Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987; Towers of London, Shallice, 1982) , on the Cognitive Estimate Test (CET; Della Sala, MacPherson, Phillips, Sacco, & Spinnler, 2003) , and on a work- ing memory task (Digit Span Backward; Orsini et al. , 1987) . His performance was normal on a go/no-go attention task (MIDA; De Tanti et al. , 1993) , on a switching task (Trail Making Test, TMT, part B; Giovagnoli et al. , 1996) , on a cate- gorical thinking task (Weigl s Sorting Test; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) , on a verbal semantic fluency task (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and on the Verbal Judgements Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) . Verbal short-term memory (Digit Span Forward, Orsini et al. , 1987) was impaired. Visuo-spatial short-term memory (Corsi s Block Tapping Test; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and the recency effect in the Serial Position Curve Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) , on the contrary, were unaffected. Anterograde mem- ory (learning) was preserved: visual and verbal delayed recall (Prose Recall, Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987; Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Recall Test, Caffarra, Vezzadini, Dieci, Zonato, & Venneri, 2002) and his performance on the visuo-spatial learning test (Corsi Supra-Span Test; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) were unimpaired. No difficulties emerged on th e Paired Associated Words Learning Test (Novelli et al. , 1986b) or on the Word List Learning Test (Mauri et al. , 1997) . Retrograde memory (retrieval) was studied with a recall test of public events from the past (verbal section of the Long Term Memory 88 Test; Andreani, Amoretti, & Baldi, 1990) and was moderately impaired. Lexical and semantic memory abilities were studied with a Picture Naming Task (Laiacona, Barbarotto, Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 464 ABBATE ETAL.

P. s performance on these tasks was fully preserved. Visual reaction times, visual attention, language, arithmetic abil- ities, visuo-spatial and constructional functions, and visual perception were unimpaired. In partic- ular, visual processing of unfamiliar objects was unimpaired (Minimal Feature View Task, Object Decision Task, and Associative Match Task from the Birmingham Object Recognition Battery, BORB; Riddoch & Humphreys, 1993; Street s Completion Test; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987; Poppelreuter Ghent s Test; Della Sala, Laiacona, Trivelli, & Spinnler, 1995; Picture Naming; Laiacona et al. , 1993) . Processing of Unfamiliar Faces (Benton, De Hamsher, Varney, & Spreen, 1992) , and recognition of facial emotional expressions (/talian Battery for Prosopoagnosia: Manera, Zonca, Pistarini, La Manna, & Luzzatti, 2006) was also preserved. Tactile recognition of 20 common objects was nor- mal and there were no signs of limb (De Renzi, 1985) or oral apraxia (De Renzi, Pieczuro, & Vignolo, 1966) . Visual processing of faces and cars Processing of face images Familiarity judgment. M. P. was shown 30 pho- tographs of faces: 15 of celebrities (well-known actors, singers, and politicians) , and 15 of persons unknown to him (the photographs were taken from the Italian Battery for Prosopoagnosia, Manera et al. , 2006) and asked to judge whether the faces were familiar.

P. s performance was compared with that of 20 control partici- pants (mean age: 34. 6 + 10. 7; mean education: 16. 7 + 2. 02 years) . Naming of famous faces from pictures. M. P. and the 20 control participants were shown 30 faces of celebrities (different from those used in the famil- iarity task) , including actors, singers, politicians, reporters, sovereigns, managers, and show persons (Supplementary material) . Pictures were taken from the same Face-Recognition Battery as used earlier. The participants were asked to name the celebrity in each picture or at least to specify his/her pro- fession; when they were able to remember only the profession, they were asked to provide as much information as possible to confirm the identifica- tion. Two points were given for a correct naming and one for identification without naming, which was accorded only if the subject was able to iden- tify the profession and at least one further semantic attribute (e. g. , for Gianni Agnelli: He was the gen- eral manager of FIAT, the car factory) . Scores ranged from 0 to 60. Results. The results obtained by M. P. in the face-processing tasks are reported in Table 4. The Crawford s statistical procedures for single-case analysis were adopted (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2002; Crawford & Howell, 1998) . M. P. s ability to distinguish celebrities from unknown faces was nor- mal (27/30; mean control performance: 27. 5 + 1. 8; t = -0. 245, p = . 81) . He was also unimpaired at identifying famous faces (50/60; mean control per- formance: 54. 8 + 5. 0; t= 0. 923, p = . 37) : he could name 22 celebrities out of 30 correctly; for six he was able to provide information regarding their pro- fession and a correct semantic attribute, but he was not able to retrieve the name. He did not identify two celebrities. Processing of car images Familiarity judgment. M. P. and the same 20 con- trol participants were shown photographs of 15 famous cars produced from 1990 to 2005 and 15 non-commercialized concept cars taken from specialized magazines for unfamiliar models (Figure 3) ; participants were asked to judge whether the cars were familiar or not. As concept cars tend to be futuristic in design, we selected pho- tos of older models to avoid participants judging modernity instead of familiarity. In addition, car logos were masked on the photographs to avoid aided recognition. The photos were randomized. Accuracy scores ranged from 0 to 30. Picture naming of famous cars. M. P. and the 20 control participants were shown photographs of 30 famous cars, produced from 1954 to 2005; models were different from those utilized in the familiarity task. Logos were masked as before and the photos were randomized. M. P. was asked to identify the make and model of each car. A com- plete response was rated two points; one point was awarded for a partial response (make but not model or vice versa) . Scores ranged from 0 to 60. Results. M. P. s performance on familiar cars is given in Table 4. Crawford s statistical procedures for single-case analysis were adopted (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2002; Crawford & Howell, 1998) to compare M. P. s performance to that of the control participants. M. P. s ability to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar concept cars was pre- served. His performance (28/30) was similar to that obtained by controls (mean control performance: 28. 5 + 1. 9; t = -0. 228, p = . 82) . M. -P. identi- fied 28 car makes and 22 models (50/60) on the identification task and his performance was quanti- tatively better than that of the control group (mean: 38. 7 + 10. 9) .

A deficit in object processing is not a necessary con- dition for developing DID. MP s performance on the object identification test (famous cars) was normal, but he showed severe and stable DID. In other words, the deficit of object identi- fication (famous buildings) showed by Hellis s patients (MY and BK) , was a supplementary disorder with respect to DID. M. P. s performance and the performances of the patients studied by Ellis et al. (1996) . Retrograde memory Autobiographical memory Memory for personal episodic events. M. P. s episodic autobiographical memory was studied with a standardized Italian test (Ghidoni, Poletti, & Bondavalli, 1995) based on the Crovitz Schiffman (1974) keyword procedure. Thirty concrete and 30 abstract words were used as stimuli, and were presented one at a time. M. P. had to read each word and recall a related personal event. Three points were given to a personal event recollected with def- inite temporal and spatial attributes, two points to an ordinary personal event, one point to a vague personal event, zero points to a purely semantic answer. Scores ranged from 0 to 180. An ad-hoc memory task was developed for M. P. , based on a list of salient episodes in his life provided by his relatives, in order to examine his episodic autobiographical memory more extensively. Sixteen episodes were chosen with a precise temporal loca- tion, one from his adolescence and the others in the period from 1985 to 1998. Each episode was associated with a keyword, and the keywords were then presented in random order. The Ghidoni test and correction procedures were used (scores ranged from 0 to 48) . The statistical analysis was based on Crawford s single-case procedure (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2002; Crawford & Howell, 1998) . Results. The keyword procedure highlighted a relevant autobiographical memory deficit. M. P. s performance on the standard test based on the Crovitz Schiffman keyword procedure was severely impaired. He obtained a raw score of 25/180 (16. 9 when adjusted for age and education) , against the controls mean score for age 30-39: 137. 3 + 20. 6 ( = -5. 815, p < . 0001) . This result was confirmed by the memory task for personal events, on which ML. scored 22/48, equivalent to a corrected score of 74. 4/180 on the Ghidoni test, whereas the con- trols mean score for age 30-39 was: 137. 3 + 20. 6 ( = 3. 038, p = . 002) .

Retrograde episodic amnesia was temporally unlimited and there was no temporal gradient. M. P. s semantic autobiographical memory was studied by means of a 15-item questionnaire taken from the personal semantic memory section of the Confabulation Battery (Dalla Barba, 1993a, 1993b) . The answers were verified with M. P. s relatives. Answers were scored 0-1, with a total accuracy score ranging from 0 to 15. Results. M. P. had no difficulty in retrieving per- sonal semantic information (score: 15/15) . Non-autobiographical memory As the Italian public events and celebrities task included in the verbal section of Andreani et al. s (1990) retrograde memory test only considers the time span from 1933s to 1987s, a new task with more recent events was developed for M. P. who was born in 1968. 15 public events and 15 celebrities from the fields of sport, art and politics (Supplementary material) were selected from 1961 to 1995 (De Agostini Iniziative Speciali, 2001) , and a question regarding each event and celebrity was formu- lated. Results were scored with Andreani et al. s (1990) criteria: 2 points were given for each com- plete response and | point for a partial response. Scores ranged from 0 to 60. M. P. s performance was compared with that of the 20 control partic- ipants (mean age: 34. 6 + 10. 7; mean education: 16. 7 + 2. 02 years) , and the results were ana- lyzed with Crawford s statistical analysis for single cases (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2002; Crawford & Howell, 1998; Crawford, Howell, & Garthwaite, 1998) . Results. The results confirmed the retrograde memory impairment previously highlighted by the Andreani et al. s (1990) test. M. P s total per- formance on the new memory task for public events and celebrities was significantly impaired (score: 26/60) with respect to that of the con- trol participants (mean: 45. 7 + 10. 3; t = 1. 863, p = . 039) . M. P. was predominantly impaired in answering questions about episodic events, with his performance on these items (score: 10/30) being significantly impaired compared with that of con- trol participants (mean: 23. 0 + 5. 0; = 2. 548, p=. 01) . He performed better on the celebrities test (16/30) , and his results were not significantly dif- ferent from those of the control participants (mean: 22. 9 + 5. 8; t = 1. 165, p = . 26) . The difference in his performances on events and celebrities was con- firmed by comparing the same difference between M. P. and the control subjects (Crawford et al. , 1998) (control subjects celebrities-events mean dif- ference: 0. 05; M.

The preservation which emerged on the retrograde memory task for celebri- ties concurs with M. P. s normal performance on the celebrity identification task. Caution must be taken when considering the dissociation between memory loss for events and memory preservation for faces. This kind of dissociation is usually found in memory tasks using events and celebrities that are closely related (Ellis, Young, & Critchley, 1989; McCarthy & Warrington, 1992) . Figure 5 provides the profile of the M. P. s retrograde amnesia. Confabulations Confabulation task. We studied M. P. s confabu- lations for two reasons. First, we hoped to verify whether confabulations and delusions are different phenomena, which usually coexist and intermingle (Mattioli, Miozzo, & Vignolo, 1991) . Second, Ellis 100_ OControis HMP Percent correct a N iad hal n hal Faces Cars Words Events Personal Personal episodic semantic Figure 5. MP s retrograde amnesia.

Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 account of DID suggests that confabulations are involved in the delusion development. In spite of his marked delusional behavior with respect to objects, M. P. did not suffer from confabulations during memory and other cognitive tasks and this was con- firmed using the Confabulation Battery developed by Dalla Barba (1993a, 1993b) . Two sections of this battery comprise each one 15 questions regard- ing personal or public events and 10 questions devised to elicit confabulations in target individu- als. Regular and confabulation-inducing questions were proposed in randomized order. Results. M. P. s performance on this task con- firmed his retrograde memory impairment. He was only able to answer a few questions from the personal and public event sections (respectively 5/15 and 7/15) of the task. However, he did not pro- duce any confabulation when the 20 confabulation- eliciting questions were posed. DISCUSSION This study describes the case of a patient with a traumatic brain injury who suffered from DID after temporary bilateral prefrontal and irreversible right temporal pole damage. The first aim of the study was to investi- gate M. P. s delusional symptoms. The same semi- structured interview was carried out three times, and two important observations were drawn. Firstly, the differences reported by M. P. between the misidentified objects and the originals were con- stant, concrete and plausible. Secondly, most of the differences he noticed were consistent with normal wear and tear, which supports the hypothesis that M. P. did in fact perceive actual differences, rather than confabulate them. Healthy individuals would have noticed the same changes identified by M. P. , as the objects had indeed changed. Moreover, these observations seem to disconfirm at least in the present case an account of DID based on damage to a belief formation process, in which a false belief provides the basis for the perceptual problems or for the misidentifications reported by the patient. As to the best of our knowledge there are only two DID case descriptions in the neuropsychological literature with extensive cognitive assessment, the second aim of the study was to draw up a detailed description of the patient s cognitive profile. The core aspect of M. P. s impairment was a severe long-term memory MISIDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS 469 disorder, with focal retrograde amnesia (Kapur, 1999) . His performance was unimpaired on stan- Retrograde focal amnesia interestingly, disso- ciation appears in focal retrograde amnesia, with was preserved. Retrograde amnesia did not show rally limited. No confabulatory behavior emerged, even after specific testing. A mild impairment of executive functions also emerged, combined with inertia and anosognosia and a selective impairment of verbal short-term memory. The third aim of the study was to verify the dou- ble dissociation between DID and CD assumed by Ellis et al. (1996) . They assumed that DID cases would show the cognitive impairment observed in some CD cases, but in reverse form, i. e. , impaired object processing with preserved face processing. M. P. suffered from severe DID without CD, and did not show either deficit in identifying familiar and unfamiliar objects. Thus our case study confirms that a processing deficit of the target of a delu- sion from the early processing stages to the most central identification stages is not a necessary (pre) condition for the development of a delusion. The fourth aim of the study was to develop an account of M. P. s pattern of impairment within the theoretical frameworks proposed by Staton et al. (1982) and by Ellis et al. (1996) . Staton et al. s or Ellis et al. s account of DID? In Staton et al. s (1982) account of DID, when patients observe faces, places, or objects they com- pare them with out-of-date memory records and so they perceive them as being different from the orig- inals. In Ellis et al. s (1996) account the differences between doubles and the originals are confabulated by the cognitive system, in other words they are not real but delusive. Following this latter hypoth- esis, M. P. should have had difficulty in describing the nature of the changes to the object, and not have been able to report concrete differences rela- tive to the physical or functional aspects. Moreover, absurd or implausible differences and vague or indefinite descriptions were to be expected. As reported in the introduction, Ellis et al. (1996) underlined that Staton et al. s (1982) account of Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 470 ABBATE ET AL. DID fails to explain cases where misidentified objects are reported to be newer and better than the originals. In their opinion, a theory based on a memory updating disorder would predict that patients would always perceive duplicates as being of inferior quality to and more worn than the orig- inals. However we have seen that our data do not completely confirm this prediction. Memory updat- ing ensures that memory traces of objects are pro- gressively modified, according to percept changes. However, these changes do not always correspond to the slight deterioration caused by normal wear and tear. If for example an object is improved, say by maintenance or overhauling, impaired updat- ing of memory traces would result in inability to incorporate the improved appearance. Therefore an explanation of DID in terms of memory updating might also be compatible with improvements to the misidentified objects. M. P. s neuropsychological assessment suggests an association of DID with memory impair- ment. M. P. suffered from a primary, moderate and selective retrograde memory deficit, especially for episodic events and for temporal encoding. On the contrary he did not suffer from either visual per- ceptual and attentional impairment, or a processing disorder of unfamiliar and familiar objects and faces. In addition, M. P. did not exhibit any ten- dency to confabulate. Moreover, the perceived differences related to the function of the object rather than exclusively to the perceptual properties of the reduplicated objects. This latter observation, together with the absence of perceptual visual impairment, rules out an exclu- sively perceptual explanation of DID for M. P. s case. The anomaly: The two-memory-recordings hypothesis It has been shown that the misidentified objects had in fact changed just as M. P. claimed they had. Their appearance had been modified by normal wear and tear, or episodic, unexpected events, and M. P. had perceived those changes just as a healthy individual would have done. He did not imagine or confabulate them. Why then did he generate a delusional substitution belief instead of accepting these changes as the normal effect of wear and tear over time? In our view this anomaly may have originated from a memory disorder, as described by Staton et al. (1982) . The current percept is not anomalous; the object is correctly perceived, carefully observed and correctly identified. A healthy individual faced with the new tires percept as M. P. was, retrieves his/her seman- tic memory recordings for the original tires (Figure 6A) ; semantic recordings include not only the general characteristics of the object as the mem- ber of a category, but also some quite invariable characteristics of the object itself (exemplar seman- tic, Gentileschi, Sperber, & Spinnler, 2001) . These semantic recordings almost completely match the present perception, except for the worn-new dif- ference, a recent modification to the appearance of the tires, which has not yet been stored in semantic memory. The tires are nonetheless recognized and identified. A healthy individual experiences a sub- jective state of knowing those objects (Gardiner & Richardson-Klavehn, 2000) , but also perceives that their attributes have been modified. When per- sonal objects show a new attribute, that has not yet been registered in semantic memory, the cognitive system recollects the recording of the personal expe- rience that is related to such modifications from the retrograde episodic memory. In the case of the perception of new tires , the cognitive system recollects the turning of the tires, which resulted in an improvement in their appearance, from the retrograde episodic memory. Thus subjects experi- ence a subjective state of remembering (Gardiner & Richardson-Klavehn, 2000) the objects, adding to the recording those traits that are compatible with the modifications made. In this way, the cur- rent percept that includes the new attribute (s) will be stored as a new anterograde memory record- ing of the well-known personal object (Figure 6A) . Subsequently this new recording will be stored in the retrograde episodic memory store and then into the semantic memory store, where the new modifi- cation to the appearance of the object will become one of its invariable characteristics. M. P. efficiently retrieved the semantic recordings of the original tires of his car from his retrograde semantic memory (Figure 6B) , experiencing a sub- jective state of knowing those tires. At the same time he perceived the worn-new modification of their appearance. However, unlike healthy individ- uals, M. P. was not able to retrieve the tire-turning key episode from his retrograde episodic mem- ory, but recollected old episodic recordings of the same object without any changes ( worn tires ) . Thus he experienced a subjective state of remem- bering the object as having an appearance that is 471 MISIDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS yoafqo [eUOIsNyap oY} Jo SuIpsooar oTWUBLUDS B 9LODAq [ITM ATTBUY pur (AIOWOUT opesTO.

In brief, M. P. experienced an anomalous sense of change with regard to his car tires because he knew them, perceived the worn- new modification, but was not able to remember the tire-turning episode. His memory was limited to worn tires. The current new tires percept would be registered as an anterograde memory recording of delusional tires, which are different to the originals (Figure 6B) . In time this episode will be stored as a retrograde episodic recording of the delusional tires. Repeated perception of the delusional objects probably favors the formation of a new semantic memory trace. Overall, our data are more compatible with Staton et al. s (1982) hypothesis than with Ellis et al. s (1996) account, but this conclusion is only tentative. In the first place, there is a difference between our two-memory-recordings hypothesis and Staton et al. s (1982) account. We suggest a selec- tive impairment of retrograde episodic memory (Figure 6B) , with preservation of retrograde seman- tic memory. On the contrary, Staton et al. s (1982) account suggests a disconnection of anterograde from retrograde memory (Figure 6A) . This lat- ter account explains why DID patients perceive differences between the original objects and the delusional duplicates, but fails to explain why they continue to consider the two objects, albeit perceptually different, as identical copies or dou- bles. Staton et al. s (1982) account differs from our hypothesis in that it does not consider the nature of the process by which healthy individ- uals experience worn and modified objects as unique and identical , notwithstanding their dif- ferent episodic emergences, and how this process may partially fail in DID. A unique impairment such as that proposed by Staton et al. (1982) can hardly explain resemblances and differences between originals and duplicates contemporane- ously, whereas in our account resemblances derive from an unimpaired matching between semantic recordings and current percept, while differences derive from erroneous recollection of stored infor- mation from the retrograde episodic memory. In the second place, there are some simi- larities between our hypothesis and the abnor- mal affective processing in Ellis et al. s (1996) account. Episodic memory and affective process- ing interact in object recognition; according to this account, when a current percept does not correspond to the episodic memory expectations an absence of emotional activation results, but it would appear familiar to the DID patient because it matches the corresponding conceptual recordings. In terms of an affective processing theory, the patient could contemporarily show overt recognition integrity, but be deficient on covert (emotional) recognition. M. P. s condition of focal, especially episodic, retrograde amnesia with preserved semantic memory is coherent with our hypothesis. His neuropsychological profile is consistent with brain-imaging data: (i) dysexecutive and apathetic akinetic syndromes usually reflect _ bilateral frontal damage; (ii) retrograde episodic amne- sia (Kopelman, 2002) presumably reflects the focal right temporal lesion (Markowitsch, 2003) . These neuro-imaging findings are consistent with those described in other cases of misidentification syndrome, which showed bilateral frontal and right temporo-parietal hemisphere damage (Doran, 1990; Luzzatti & Verga, 1996; Devinsky, 2009) . The small temporal lesion causing the DID disorder is located in the anterior part of the right parahippocampal gyrus, i. e, the enthorinal cor- tex (Brodmann area 28) . The entorhinal, perirhi- nal, and parahippocampal cortex form a com- plex network of connections between widespread areas of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, known as the medial temporal lobe system (MTL) (Eichenbaum & Lipton, 2008) without recollection of stimuli associations. On the contrary, the parahip- pocampal cortex and the MEC are specialized in the recollection of spatial information of individ- ual objects and not in their familiarity. Moreover, Eichenbaum and Lipton (2008) have suggested that the MEC and the associated cortical areas of the where stream may also be specialized in the encoding and the retrieval of the temporal context of the stimuli. Evidence of two distinct anatomical and func- tional pathways that process familiarity and recol- lection separately in the MTL system, supports our explanation of DID as based on two independent memory processes for knowing and remembering. Moreover, the intriguing hypothesis that recollec- tion in MTL not only includes the spatial but also the temporal context of stimuli clarifies the nature of the episodic memory impairment assumed by our model. This in fact could correspond to defec- tive temporal context recollection in the where stream of the MTL system, while the what stream maintains its functional integrity. Due to this, two discrete episodic representations, both referring to the same object but in distinct moments in time, are linked to the same temporal context. Therefore, an episodic recording of an object (e. g. , worn tires) in the past would be processed as immediately preced- ing to a more recent recording of the same object (e. g. , new tires) . Thus, as happened in M. P. s case, the change in appearance of the object between the two recordings would appear too radical and too sudden to be explained by normal wear and tear. According to the dual-process model of recog- nition, delusional-misidentification syndromes are related to familiarity rather than to recollection dysfunction (Devinsky, 2009) . In this respect, our account provides a novel opposite view, i. e. , a delu- sion that depends on a dysfunction of recollection, without any familiarity impairment. Evidence for two processing streams associated to what and where information inside the MTL system sup- ports the idea that right-temporal damage, as in M. P. s case, would impair recollection more than familiarity. It has been shown that frontal dysfunction is associated to recollection impairment (Skinner & Fernandes, 2007) . It was probably frontal dysfunc- tion in M. P. s case that contributed to developing MISIDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS 473 and maintaining DID by impairing his ability to detect incorrect temporal associations between dis- crete episodes referred to the same object. This is coherent with a hypothetical dysfunction of time estimation and sequencing, two processes that are intimately related to frontal functions.

The lateral entorhi- nal cortex (LEC) receives its major projections from the perirhinal cortex, which is mostly con- nected with the unimodal sensory association cor- tical areas along the ventral visual pathways (i. e. , the what stream) . On the contrary, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) receives major projec- tions from the parahippocampal cortex, which is primarily connected with polymodal spatial areas of the cerebral cortex along the dorsal visual stream (i. e. , the where stream) . The LEC and the MEC have few direct connections and send sep- arate projections to the hippocampus. Therefore, the distinction between a stream for processing the non-spatial aspects of stimuli, which is impor- tant for object recognition ( what information) and a stream for processing the spatial aspects of sensory information, which is important for spa- tial attention and for visuo-spatially guided action ( where information) , is also applicable to the MTL system. Consequently there is a vast con- vergence of where and what information within the hippocampus. Coherently with the anatom- ical and functional data, activation studies (see Downloaded by [Northwestern University] at 08: 56 22 December 2014 Eichenbaum & Lipton, 2008 for a review) found that the perirhinal cortex and the LEC are spe- cialized in recognizing objects according to their familiarity (Mayes et al. , 2007) , a process that is presumably related to perceptual memory functions (Markowitsch, 2003) , and .

A. B. Jamjoom! - P. Gallo - J. Kandasamy - J. Phillips D. Sokol Received: 17 April 2016 /Accepted: 9 March 2017 /Published online: 21 March 2017 The Author (s) 2017. This article is published with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Introduction The right prefrontal lobe has not traditionally been considered eloquent brain. Resection of tumours within this region does not typically lead to permanent functional impairment. In this report, we highlight the case of a patient who developed autobiographical memory loss following an uncomplicated resection of a right prefrontal tumour. Case material A previously fit and well 15-year old presented with a persistent right-sided headache. An MRI demonstrated an expanded right mid-frontal gyrus with changes consistent with a low-grade tumour. The patient underwent a right-sided craniotomy and resection of the lesion which was confirmed as a WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma. Postoperatively, the patient reported profound retrograde amnesia for a range of memory components, in particular autobiographical memory and semantic memory. Postoperative imaging showed a good resection margin with no evidence of underlying brain injury. Over an 18-month period, the patient showed no improvement in autobiographical memory; however, significant relearning of semantic knowledge took place and her academic perfor- mance was found to be in line with expectations for her age. Conclusion In this report, we discuss a case and review the literature on the role of the right prefrontal cortex in memory and caution on the perception of right prefrontal non-eloquence. Keywords Right prefrontal lobe - Memory loss - Astrocytoma - Episodic memory A. A. B. Jamjoom aabjamjoom@ gmail. com ' Royal Hospital for Sick Children, 9 Sciennes Rd, Edinburgh EH9 1LF, UK Case report History A 15-year-old right-handed female (VF) presented in 2012 with a history of weekly headaches over the right side of her head and with a sudden onset of diminished auditory acuity in her right ear when she was wearing headphones. She per- ceived music in the right ear as a noise rather than music. There was no history of developmental, psychological or school difficulties. Audiological assessment found normal neurological responses to sound stimuli bilaterally suggesting normal hearing function (10 dB at 1 kHz and 20 dB at 4 kHz) . A subsequent brain MRI showed the presence of an expanded right mid-frontal gyrus with changes extending from the cor- tex into the subcortical white matter consistent with a possible low-grade tumour (Fig. 1) . Initially, VF was followed up with serial imaging until slight growth of the lesion was observed 14 months after diagnosis. She underwent a right-sided crani- otomy and resection of the progressive right frontal lesion in February 2014. Histopathological analysis confirmed a WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma. Postoperatively, VF reported profound retrograde amnesia for a range of memory components, in particular, autobio- graphical memory and semantic memory. For example, she could not recall her parents, life history or friends. She could not recall her way around school and reported loss of knowl- edge such as her time table or how to make a cup of tea. Imaging demonstrated a good radiological resection of the lesion with no evidence of surrounding brain injury (Fig. 1) . VF underwent no additional therapy following her surgery as follow-up imaging demonstrated a good resection and no tu- mour recurrence. Interestingly, her subjective hearing loss nor- malised after surgery. D Springer 1222 Childs Nerv Syst (2017) 33: 1221-1223 oo Fig. 1 Preoperative and 3-month postoperative MRI images from VF including (from lefi to right) axial T1 post-gadolinium, coronal FLAIR MRI, sagittal T1, axial T2 and axial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps Neuropsychological assessment VF underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assess- ment at a month, 6 months and 18 months after surgery. VF reported no improvement in autobiographical memory; how- ever, significant relearning of semantic knowledge took place and VF s academic performance was found to be in line with expectations for her age. VF reported ongoing difficulties in attention, prospective memory, poor organisational skills and emotional lability. VF s last assessment indicated general in- tellectual abilities, executive skills and memory abilities in the average range, demonstrating age-appropriate skills in new learning and laying down new memories. Significant difficul- ties were identified in attention (particularly sustained, switching and dual-task attention) . Discussion VF s case report demonstrates the dramatic disruption of epi- sodic memory following the uncomplicated resection of a right-sided frontal lesion. Within neurosurgery, damage to the right prefrontal cortex is not commonly associated with significant memory impairment. However, a review of the literature demonstrated several studies and case reports looking at the subject of memory and the right frontal lobe. In 1996, Schacter described a case report of a patient who demonstrated striking patterns of false recognition following a right frontal lobe infarction [1]. The authors put the patient through a catalogue of cognitive tests and concluded that the patient s high false recognition rate may be due to the loss of the right frontal lobe s retrieval capacities which are vital for item recognition. A further lesion study by McDonald and D Springer colleagues looked to compare episodic memory in patients with left and right frontal lobe lesion resections for intractable epilepsy [2]. Interestingly, the patients with right frontal lobe lesions showed impairment of recognition memory compared to the other left frontal lobe and control groups. In the last 15 years, there has been growing neuroimaging evi- dence on the role of the right prefrontal lobe in episodic memory. The activation of the prefrontal cortex in episodic memory retrieval has been a consistent finding [3]. However, teasing out the exact process and roles of the right prefrontal cortex remained. Over the convening years, the right prefrontal cortex has been demonstrated to be part of a network involved in retrieval of episodic memory, in particular, the monitoring of retrieved information [4, 5]. Studies have focused on elucidating episodic memory retrieval mode which refers to a cognitive state where an individual holds a past episode in focal attention and treats incoming information as re- trieval cues [6]. A study by Henson using functional MRI found dissociation in activity between the dorsal and ventral regions of the prefrontal cortex with the dorsal region associated with increased contextual monitoring and the ventral region being independent of task instructions [7]. Similarly, a positron emission tomography study by LePage identified three regions within the right prefrontal cortex in playing a role in episodic memory retrieval: frontal pole [Brodmann s area (BA) 10], frontal operculum (BA 47/45) and lateral dorsal area (BA 8/9) [6]. This process has been found to be suppressed in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , who have impaired memory, with deactivation of the right dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex during memory retrieval compared to con- trols [8]. Similarly, patients with right frontal lobe tumour resections had impaired recollection-based verbal memory compared to healthy controls [9]. Interestingly, Ragilo and colleagues found activation of the right middle frontal gyrus and, in particular, the right precentral Childs Nerv Syst (2017) 33: 1221-1223 gyrus in volunteers undergoing active music therapy [10]. A study by Janata looked at the association between autobiographical memory and music and concluded that the medial prefrontal cor- tex may play a role [11]. VF had presented with reduced auditory acuity in her right ear which may have been related to the tumour. However, this subjective auditory impairment improved after sur- gery while VF s episodic memory impairment remained prob- lematic which points away from a direct anatomical correlation. The evidence for the role of the right prefrontal cortex in episodic memory retrieval may indicate the potential biologi- cal cause for VF s memory impairment. However, the exact cause of the severity of VF s deficit is to be explained. This is not fully accounted for by her performance on standardised neuropsychological tests. Similarly, we were unable to under- take functional MRI on VF. This investigation could have helped provide more information on function localisation. However, given VF s preoperative function, the anatomical location of the lesion and planned surgical approach, function- al imaging is not routinely undertaken in our hospital. While we cannot entirely rule out a biological explanation, psycho- genic or functional mechanisms should be considered. VF s day-to-day functioning is mostly affected by poor attention which may impact on new learning as well as reported diffi- culties in executive functioning and psychological status [12]. However, based on VF s neuropsychological assessment, as- sociated psychological factors may also contribute to reported difficulties in executive function. This is likely to be some- thing of a vicious cycle with psychological factors exacerbat- ing underlying vulnerabilities in attention. The right prefrontal cortex has long been considered by neu- rosurgeons to be a non-eloquent and relatively safe for resection. However, the prefrontal cortex is essential for attention control, manipulation of stored knowledge and modulation of complex actions, cognition,",

One distinction may be their level of specificity, with autobiographical facts reflecting idiosyncratic conceptual knowledge and personal traits representing basic level category knowledge about the self. Given the critical role of the left anterior ven- trolateral temporal lobe (AVTL) in the storage and retrieval of semantic information about unique entities, we hypothesized that knowledge of autobiographical facts may depend on the integrity of this region to a greater extent than personal traits. To provide neuropsychological evidence relevant to this issue, we investigated personal semantics, semantic knowledge of non-personal unique entities, and episodic memory in two in- dividuals with well-defined left (MK) versus right (DW) AVTL lesions. Relative to controls, MK demonstrated preserved personal trait knowledge but impaired experience-far (i. e. , spatiotemporal independent) auto- biographical fact knowledge, semantic memory for non-personal unique entities, and episodic memory. In contrast, both experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits were spared in DW, whereas episodic memory and aspects of semantic memory for non-personal unique entities were impaired. These findings support the notion that autobiographical facts and personal traits have distinct cognitive features and neural mechan- isms. They also suggest a common organizing principle for personal and non-personal semantics, namely the specificity of such knowledge to an entity, which is reflected in the contribution of the left AVTL to retrieval. 1. Introduction proposal that personal semantics are organized into subtypes of knowledge that vary in their cognitive features, and accordingly the neural mechanisms that are necessary for their storage and retrieval (Renoult et al. , 2012) . 1. 1. Personal semantics Much of one's autobiographical memory is composed of personal semantics, which is knowledge about the self that contextualizes ex- periences and adds meaning to the life story (Cermak and O'Connor, 1983; Conway and Pleydell-Pearce, 2000; Klein and Lax, 2010; Kopelman et al. , 1989) . Despite the importance of personal semantics to one's sense of self (Addis and Tippett, 2004; Grilli, 2017; Grilli & Verfaellie, 2015; Klein and Gangi, 2010; Klein et al. , 2003; Klein and Lax, 2010) , how such knowledge is organized and retrieved remains underspecified. Recent studies have begun to close this gap in knowl- edge, showing that the retrieval of personal semantics shares cognitive and neural mechanisms with general semantic memory, which is world or culturally shared knowledge, as well as with episodic memory, which is memory for unique events (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2014, 2016; Renoult et al. , 2016; Tanguay et al. , 2018) . These findings have supported the 1. 2. Autobiographical facts versus personal trait knowledge According to current theoretical models, autobiographical facts and personal traits are two subtypes of personal semantic knowledge (Klein and Lax, 2010; Renoult et al. , 2012) . From this viewpoint, auto- biographical facts represent a range of knowledge about people, places, and activities, whereas personal trait knowledge is narrower in content, capturing basic descriptors of one's identity. In addition to representing different contents, it has been proposed that these two types of personal semantic memory are supported by distinct neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval (Klein and Lax, 2010) . Reports that personal trait knowledge can be spared in the face of impaired autobiographical fact knowledge in individuals with MTL amnesia have been taken as * Corresponding author at: Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, 1503 E.

Also favoring this interpretation, a impaired retrieval of spe- cific names as well as subordinate categorization of non-personal un- ique entities and concepts, with basic level category knowledge in the general semantic domain usually relatively spared (Lambon Ralph et al. , 2012; Tranel, 2006, 2009; Rogers et al. , 2015; Patterson et al. , 2007) , or not correlated with lesions to the AVTL (Damasio et al. , 1996) . Similar results have been found in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (Benke et al. , 2013) . Functional neuroimaging studies have also associated the processing of familiar faces and buildings with the left AVTL in particular (Grabowski et al. , 2001; Gorno-Tempini and Price, 2001; Brambati et al. , 2010; Ross and Olson, 2012) , whereas retrieving semantic information that reflects intermediate or basic level category knowledge (e. g. classifying an object as a bird/dog or an an- imal/vehicle) has been associated with activation that extends from the AVTL to more posterior cortical regions (Rogers et al. , 2006) . There- fore, if experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge and personal trait knowledge are organized by their specificity, they may differ in the extent to which they depend on the left AVTL for storage and retrieval, similar to the differential involvement of this brain region in the re- trieval of unique versus non-unique knowledge in the general semantic domain. Although numerous neuropsychological studies have shown that individuals with lesions to the left AVTL often have impaired auto- biographical fact knowledge (Graham and Hodges, 1997; Herfurth et al. statements, the integrity of personal trait knowledge was not directly assessed. Tulving (Tulving, 1993) reported that amnesic patient K. C. could reliably and accurately judge his personal traits, but K. C. also demonstrated temporally-graded impairment of autobiographical fact knowledge (Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) . Thus K. C. s lesions to the lateral temporal lobes, which were relatively minimal (Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) , may not have been ex- tensive enough to severely disrupt either type of memory. Therefore, M. D. Grilli et al. whether damage to the left AVTL can impair the retrieval of personal trait knowledge is not known. 1. 4. Present study The goal of the present study was to directly compare, for the first time, experience-far autobiographical fact and personal trait knowledge in individuals with well-defined and largely complementary focal lesion to the left or right AVTL. In particular, we wanted to determine whether specificity of knowledge distinguishes these two types of personal se- mantic memory at the neural level, providing evidence for their func- tional distinctiveness postulated by cognitive models of auto- biographical memory (Conway, 2005; Klein and Lax, 2010; Renoult et al. , 2012) . In addition, we wanted to obtain neuropsychological evidence relevant to the hypothesis that the left AVTL may serve a common organizing function for both personal and non-personal (i. e. , general) semantics. To assess experience-far autobiographical facts, we derived a sub-score from the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI; Kopelman et al. , 1989) , focusing on the questions that required re- trieval of names of people and buildings, as such content is considered to be devoid of spatiotemporal context and thus experience-far (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2016) . Consistent with prior studies (Klein and Lax, 2010; Tulving, 1993) , to assess personal trait knowledge, we measured the reliability of the participants ratings of their personality char- acteristics, and in a follow-up, we assessed accuracy of trait knowledge in one of the temporal lobe lesion participants. We separated the AMI sub-score and personal trait rating task into retrograde and anterograde components. Whereas the retrograde components could provide insight into the role of the left AVTL in the retrieval of consolidated personal semantics, the anterograde components could illuminate the im- portance of this brain region to the storage of new personal knowledge. To assess the degree of overlap in the contribution of the AVTL to general semantics and personal semantics and to investigate the influ- ence of levels of specificity in both domains, we also included experi- mental measures of retrograde semantic memory for non-personal un- ique entities (i. e. , famous people and places) . Notably, the temporal lobe participants were given multiple tests of basic level category knowledge as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation completed before this study, and they demonstrated largely normal performance. Finally, to provide a broader context, we also assessed retrograde and anterograde episodic memory with the AMI. We hypothesized that if experience-far autobiographical facts and personal trait knowledge are organized according to their specificity to a particular entity, this cognitive feature would be reflected in the impact of AVTL damage to their storage and retrieval. In other words, the left AVTL may serve a domain-general role in the retrieval of per- sonal and non-personal specific knowledge, in which case both ex- perience-far autobiographical facts and specific attributes of non-per- sonal semantic knowledge would be impaired in the left temporal lobe participant. In contrast, personal trait knowledge may be a basic level form of personal knowledge and largely spared in the left temporal lobe participant, similar to basic level category knowledge in the general semantic domain. However, if experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits are not organized according to their specificity, left AVTL damage would presumably affect both types of memory equally. We also acknowledged that the right AVTL may play a role for personal semantics, given evidence that impaired autobiographical fact knowl- edge has been associated with damage to right lateral temporal lobe regions (Herfurth et al. , 2010; Philippi et al. , 2015) . However, we 1 We did not systematically evaluate accuracy of personal trait knowledge (i. e. con- sistency between self ratings and ratings of an informant) . One of the temporal lobe participants (DW) did not have someone who could provide ratings of her personality before her surgery, and she had not formed strong relationships at her new living loca- tion. This created problems not only for evaluating her accuracy but also for selecting appropriate informants for controls. 180 Neuropsychologia 117 (2018) 178-187 hypothesized that personal semantic and general semantic impairments would be more severe in the participant with left lateralized lesions relative to the participant with right lateralized lesions, given that functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings indicate that both personal semantics and semantics of non-personal unique entities are associated with left lateralized regions of the temporal lobe more than corresponding regions on the right (Brambati et al. , 2010; Grabowski et al. , 2001; Martinelli et al. , 2013; Herfurth et al. , 2010; Tranel, 2009) . 2. Methods This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of Arizona. 2. 1. Participants 2. 1. 1. Temporal lobe participants MK was a 51-year old male when he participated in this study. He was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy (complex partial type) at the age of eight, at which time he was placed on anti-seizure medica- tion. His medication regimen successfully controlled his epilepsy throughout his childhood and early adulthood. He attended regular classrooms without difficulty and went on to complete a master's degree in computer engineering (i. e. , 18 years of education) . He then worked in computer technology until 2013, when he developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the onset of which was localized to the left MTL. In 2013, MK underwent left anterior temporal lobe surgical resection. MK reported mild to moderate changes in memory post-surgery. Although he lives semi-independently with his spouse, he was not able to return to his previous position of employment, despite initially at- tempting to do so. As a result, he retired and enjoys working in his garden and walking for exercise. DW was a 48-year old female when she participated in this study. In 2013, she was diagnosed with a right temporal meningioma after sudden onset of severe headaches. She underwent an emergent neuro- surgical resection without complications. She reported moderate to severe memory problems post-surgery, which affected her ability to manage daily responsibilities. Prior to her memory impairment, DW lived independently and worked as a police officer. Her performance in grade school was average, and she completed three years of a bachelor's degree in law enforcement (i. e. , 15 years of education) . She currently lives in an assisted living facility, requiring support for activities of daily living, including meals and transportation. Coronal images in radiologic view from clinical MRI scans for MK and DW are presented in Fig. 1. Examination of MK's scan revealed that his surgical procedure resulted in damage to the most anterior 3. 5 cm of the left ventrolateral and medial temporal lobe. The tissue loss/en- cephalomalacia is extensive and extends caudally and medially from the temporal pole and includes superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, para- hippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and the anterior portion of the hippo- campus. The superior temporal gyrus is partially spared. DW's scan revealed that her surgical procedure resulted in lesions to the right temporal lobe extending caudally 5. 5cm from the temporal pole and medially, with extensive tissue loss/encephalomalacia in the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. The amygdala and hippocampus appear to be partially spared but are essentially dis- connected from entorhinal/parahippocampal regions. The superior temporal gyrus also appears to be partly spared. 2. 1. 2. Neuropsychological data 2. 1. 2. 1. Intelligence and memory function. Table 1 shows the results of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of MK and DW. MK demonstrated average intelligence with a relative strength in the visual M. D. Grilli et al.

In regard to episodic memory, MK exhibited impairment restricted to the verbal domain. Performances on tests of processing speed and working memory were within normal limits. DW demonstrated average intelligence with no significant verbal or visual strength. In light of her estimated intelligence, DW's episodic. but in her 181 case both verbal and visual domains were affected. She demonstrated intact performances on tests of processing speed and working memory. 2. 1. 2. 2. Basic level category knowledge. The temporal lobe participants were given standard neuropsychological tests of basic level category knowledge prior to this study, including measures of object naming and M. D. Grilli et al. fluency. MK's raw score of 51 on the Boston Naming Test was mildly impaired for his age and education level. However, he correctly named 5 of the 9 missed items when given a phonemic cue. Moreover, for 3 of his errors, prior to cueing he provided answers suggesting preserved superordinate semantic knowledge (e. g. , harmonica for accordion) . To develop a more complete picture of his naming ability, he also was given the Cambridge Naming Test (Adlam et al. , 2010) , which probes knowledge of several living (birds, mammals, fruits) and non-living (household objects, transportation, tools) categories. On this test, he only missed one point, and was well within normal limits. Together, his confrontation naming scores suggest that basic level category knowledge of living and non-living things was largely spared. Consistent with this interpretation, his performance on animal fluency was within normal limits. DW was given the same basic level category knowledge tests. As shown in Table 1, her performance was within normal limits for all of these tests. 2. 1. 3. Controls Ten healthy individuals (6 females and 4 males) matched to MK and DW on age (M = 54. 8, SD = 7. 2) and education (M = 16. 9, SD = 0. 99) also participated, p's > . 10. These individuals did not have remarkable medical or psychiatric histories, and they scored within normal limits on a mental status screen (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Nasreddine et al. , 2005) . 2. 2. Methods and procedures 2. 2. 1. Personal semantics Experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge was assessed with the AMI. The AMI measures autobiographical fact knowledge with what is referred to as the Personal Semantic Schedule, which is similar to an interview about the names of people and places, addresses, and other factual knowledge from childhood, adulthood, and recent life. Although the questions in the Personal Semantic Schedule were not originally categorized as experience-near or experience-far, we used the con- ceptual framework and scoring protocol of Grilli and Verfaellie (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2016) to identify questions that were clearly experience- far. We identified 30 such questions, all of which assessed knowledge of names for people and buildings that were part of one's personal his- tory. The experience-far autobiographical fact score was separated into retrograde (childhood and adulthood, n = 20) and anterograde (recent can be experience-far if one lived at the same address for years before and after marriage) . 182 Neuropsychologia 117 (2018) 178-187 retrograde and anterograde knowledge in the temporal lobe partici- pants, these individuals completed two versions of the rating measure, separated by approximately one month. In one version, the temporal lobe participants were asked to judge the personality traits on the basis of their personality before surgery (i. e. , retrograde) . In the other ver- sion, they were asked to judge the personality traits on the basis of their present personality (i. e. , anterograde) . The controls only completed the latter version of the trait rating task. Consistency of participants per- sonal trait knowledge was calculated with one-way intraclass correla- tion coefficients (ICCs) , single measure, between the first and second ratings of participants self-ratings (i. e. , between session 1 and session 2) . As described in the results, MK exhibited a discrepancy in the re- trieval of experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge and personal trait knowledge. To more completely understand this difference and address interpretative issues and potential limitations associated with using trait consistency as the only measure (e. g. , the possibility that a person makes judgments on the basis of social desirability or proto- typical characteristics, or the concern that one's trait judgments may be consistent but not accurate) , we conducted a follow-up assessment in which we evaluated the accuracy of MK's personal trait knowledge. MK's wife, who has known him for over 20 years, completed the per- sonality trait questionnaire for his personality characteristics before and after his surgery. Accuracy of his personal trait knowledge was calculated with two-way mixed ICCs, absolute agreement, between the ratings of MK in session 1 and session 2 of both retrograde and ante- rograde versions of the questionnaire and his wife's ratings of him be- fore and after surgery. 2. 2. 2. Retrograde semantic memory for non-personal unique entities We included three measures of retrograde semantic memory for specific attributes of non-personal unique entities. Similar to our mea- sure of experience-far autobiographical facts, these tests assessed knowledge of names or other specific attributes of people and places. One was a famous places test, which depicted scenic views of 40 world landmarks (e. g. , Eifel Tower, Machu Picchu) and required par- ticipants to name the landmark or its location. The second was a fa- mous faces test, which consisted of headshots of 40 individuals from politics and entertainment in the United States (e. g. , Bill Clinton, Stephen Colbert) . Participants were required to generate the name as- sociated with the face, or provide other identity-specific information about the individual. Whereas the famous places and famous faces tests required that only a single specific associate was retrieved, to be more consistent with the Personal Semantic Schedule of the AMI, we also assessed access to multiple facts related to a single non-personal unique entity with a famous person knowledge test. This test required par- ticipants to retrieve = 12 MK a ij g % 204 MK uk a Ke} Dw Dw fd Y iw DW ik 8 MK A MK rN Dw Ma | o Dw Retrograde Anterograde Positive Ses. 1 Negative Ses. 1 Positive Ses. 2 Negative Ses. 2 Fig. 2.

Analyses MK's and DW's scores were compared to control participants with Bayesian single-case and dissociation methods (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2007; Crawford et al. , 2010) . Effect size for the difference between the temporal lobe participant and controls is calculated as z- scores with a 95% confidence interval (CI) . 3. Results 3. 1. Retrograde personal semantics As shown in Fig. 2 ( Experience-Far Autobiographical Facts and Personality Trait Consistency ) , there were both similarities and dis- sociations in the retrograde personal semantic memory profiles of MK and DW. In comparison to the controls, experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge was impaired for MK, p = . 0001, z = 6. 8 (CI: 10. 0 to 3. 7) , but it was within normal limits for DW, p = . 40, z = 0. 9 (CI: 1. 6 to 0. 2) . However, personal trait knowledge consistency was highly reliable and well within normal limits for both MK, p = . 71, z= 0. 4 (CI: 0. 3 to 1. 0) , and DW, p = . 41, z = 0. 9 (CI: 0. 1-1. 6) . 3. 2. Retrograde semantic memory for specific attributes of non-personal unique entities Assessment of semantic memory for specific attributes of non- 183 personal unique entities also revealed similarities and dissociations between MK and DW (Fig. 2, Non-Personal Unique Knowledge ) . Re- lative to the controls, In comparison, DW was within normal limits for famous faces, p = . 37, z = 1. 0 (CI: 0. 2-1. 7) , and for facts about famous people, p = . 65, z = 0. 5 (CI: 0. 2 to 1. 1) . 3. 3. Retrograde episodic autobiographical memory 3. 4, Anterograde personal semantics As shown in Fig. 2 ( Experience-Far Autobiographical Facts and Personality Trait Consistency ) , anterograde z= 3. 7 (CI: -5. 4 to M. D. Grilli et al. 1. 9) , which is not surprising given his performance in the retrograde domain. Unlike MK but also similar to her performance in the retro- grade domain, DW's retrieval of anterograde experience-far auto- biographical facts was within normal limits in comparison to the con- trol group, p = . 55, z = 0. 6 (CI: 0. 1 to 1. 3) . As was the case in the retrograde domain, both temporal lobe participants were highly reli- able and within normal limits in comparison to the controls in their personal trait ratings: MK, p = . 78, z = 0. 3 (CI: 0. 3 to 0. 9) , and DW, p = . 47, 2 = 0. 8 (CI: 0. 1-1. 5) . It is possible that both temporal lobe participants were reliable in their personality trait ratings for the anterograde domain, because they rated themselves the same as they did in the retrograde domain. To investigate this idea, we asked MK and DW to report whether they believed that their personality has changed since surgery on a 5-point scale (1 = very much the same; 2 = mostly the same, 3 = slightly the same, 4 = mostly different, and 5 = very much different) . MK reported that his current personality was mostly the same as before his surgery, whereas DW reported that her personality was very much the same. To assess whether their ratings corresponded to these subjective judg- ments, we compared the first ratings from the retrograde domain to the second ratings in the anterograde domain for each temporal lobe par- ticipant. Reliability was high in both MK (ICC = 0. 75) and DW (ICC = 0. 84) . 3. 5. Anterograde episodic autobiographical memory Relative to the controls, anterograde episodic autobiographical memory was impaired in both MK, p = . 0003, z = 5. 9 (CI: 8. 7 to 3. 2) , and DW, p = . 00001, z = 9. 0 (CI: 13. 2 to 4. 9) (Fig. 2, Episodic Memory ) , which is not surprising given their retrograde performances. 3. 6. Follow-up assessment 3. 6. 1. Personal trait knowledge accuracy Comparison of MK's ratings of himself with his wife's ratings of him demonstrated that he was accurate in rating his retrograde personal trait knowledge (ICC = 0. 86 for session 1 and 0. 87 for session 2) and his anterograde personal trait knowledge (ICC = 0. 77 for session 1 and 0. 83 for session 2) . We also asked MK's wife whether she believed his personality has changed since his surgery, and she provided the same answer as MK (i. e. , he is mostly the same) . 3. 6. 2. Personality trait positivity bias To further evaluate the integrity of personal trait knowledge in MK and DW, we investigated whether they showed a normal positivity bias, which is the tendency to endorse positive traits at a higher rate than negative traits. As shown in Fig. 2 ( Personality Traits Endorsed ) , both participants and controls endorsed positive traits more than negative traits. For retrograde ratings, MK and DW did not differ from the con- trols for the number of positive or negative traits endorsed at either session, p's > . 12. Similarly, for anterograde ratings, MK and DW did not differ for the number of positive traits endorsed at either session, or for the number of negative traits endorsed at session 2, p's > . 31. However, both MK and DW endorsed fewer negative traits relative to controls at session 1 (MK: p = . 02; z = 3. 0, CI: -4. 45 to -1. 48; DW: p = . 04; Z= 2. 6, Cl: -3. 89 to -1. 24) , indicating that they exhibited magnified positivity biases in the anterograde domain. 3. 6. 3. Additional personal semantic interview with MK The magnitude of MK's impaired experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge was particularly striking in the context of his spared personal trait knowledge retrieval. It also appeared that, in comparison to the controls, retrograde episodic autobiographical memory was less severely impaired than retrograde experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge in MK, given the confidence intervals of the magnitude of 184 Neuropsychologia 117 (2018) 178-187 his impairments. To assess this further, we conducted a Bayesian test on the difference between MK's scores on these two autobiographical memory tests (Crawford et al. , 2010) . Retrograde experience-far auto- biographical fact knowledge was more severely impaired relative to retrograde episodic autobiographical memory, p = . 03, z = 3. 7. In contrast, there was not a strong dissociation between these two types of autobiographical memory in the anterograde domain, p 32, % = 1. 5, although MK's near floor performance for anterograde facts limited the power of this analysis. To further evaluate the stability of MK's impaired retrieval of ex- perience-far autobiographical facts, we re-administered the Personal Semantic Schedule from the AMI to him one month after the initial evaluation was completed. Interestingly, he received the exact same score on the re-admission, providing I don t know responses to the same questions as he did initially. In many instances, MK exhibited awareness of the unusualness of his lack of autobiographical fact knowledge. Below is an exchange between the experimenter and MK that captures both the severity of his memory impairment and his in- sight. MDG: Can you tell me your wife's maiden name? MK: (long pause) It is not coming to mind. Gosh, if she knew that. . . MDG: | asked you that question a few weeks back, and you couldn t recall at that time either. Does that surprise you? MK: Well, I know that I knew it at one point (laughs) . I just haven t had to use it in a long time, probably since we got married. [. . ] MDG: Where did you live after you married? MK: It is too confusing to figure out. (long pause) I just cannot remember. When you ask these questions I feel lost in my own memories. It just doesn t seem to make sense. 4. Discussion 4. 1. Experience-far autobiographical facts and personal trait knowledge We found that an individual with damage to the left AVTL, but not an individual with damage to the right AVTL, exhibited disrupted re- trieval of experience-far autobiographical facts. In MK, both retrograde and anterograde autobiographical fact knowledge was compromised, indicating that this disruption was not isolated to new learning, but rather also affected retrieval of remote facts about his life. It is im- portant to note that MK's MTL lesion may have contributed to his im- paired anterograde fact memory, given that regions of the MTL (in- cluding the anterior hippocampus) are believed to support the acquisition of new knowledge (Moscovitch et al. , 2016; Poppenk et al. , 2013) . However, the findings from Grilli and Verfaellie (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2016) indicate that the retrieval of experience-far auto- biographical facts, once consolidated, are not affected in individuals with isolated MTL damage. This argues against the notion that MK's impaired retrograde experience-far autobiographical fact knowledge could reflect MTL damage and suggests instead that the deficit was attributable to the extension of the lesion into the AVTL. This conclu- sion is bolstered by evidence from the general semantic domain that knowledge acquired in the years immediately preceding onset of am- nesia is spared and independent of the MTL (Verfaellie et al. , 1995) . Therefore, the retrograde findings are consistent with the idea that experience-far autobiographical facts represent idiosyncratic knowl- edge about personally known entities that depends on the left AVTL for retrieval. They also align with prior neuropsychological evidence that autobiographical fact knowledge, broadly defined, is more left than right lateralized (Herfurth et al. , 2010, but also see Philippi et al. , 2015) . Despite a profound impairment of experience-far autobiographical M. D. Grilli et al. facts, MK demonstrated reliable ratings of his retrograde personal trait knowledge, as did DW. Both individuals also showed the typical posi- tivity bias in their ratings of their retrograde personality characteristics. Although trait consistency is informative, triangulation from an in- dependent rater is important for assuring that such ratings are truly reflective of one's personality, as opposed to judgments made on the basis of assumed social desirability. In other words, although weak memory traces for personal trait knowledge may lead to inconsistent ratings (Marquine et al. , 2016) , other social factors or general knowl- edge (i. e. , what most people are like) could rescue performance. In this regard, it is critical that we also determined through a follow-up as- sessment that MK's retrograde personal trait knowledge was accurate. This accuracy data corroborates the consistency findings and indicates that MK's access to such knowledge is largely spared. Given that we could not obtain accuracy ratings for DW, we acknowledge that some doubt remains about the role of the right AVTL for personal trait knowledge. Nonetheless, the autobiographical fact and personal trait knowledge findings from MK support theoretical models that separate these two types of personal semantic memory (Klein and Lax, 2010; Renoult et al. , 2012) . For both MK and DW, personal trait knowledge retrieval was reli- able when they were asked to complete the personality trait rating task for their personality after surgery. Importantly, our accuracy assess- ment of MK's ratings supports the notion that he was in fact judging his personality as opposed to giving desirable or prototypical responses. However, we hesitate to conclude that the left or right AVTL are not essential for updating personal trait knowledge. Critically, MK and DW reported minimal change in personality, and consistent with their subjective reports, their ratings across the retrograde and anterograde domain were reliable. Therefore, minimal updating of their personal trait knowledge may have been required. In line with this idea, MK's wife agreed that his personality has not changed much. Interestingly, there was one discrepancy between the temporal lobe participants and controls: their positivity biases were magnified in the anterograde do- main, with both individuals endorsing fewer negative traits. That being said, it is not obvious that this reflects a compromised ability to update trait knowledge, since it is driven by a reduction in endorsing traits as self-descriptive. On the basis of MK's findings, along with recent work (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2014, 2016; Marquine et al. , 2016; Martinelli et al. , 2013) , we propose that personal semantic memory can be viewed as consisting of subtypes of content that place distinct computational demands on regions in the autobiographical memory network. Autobiographical facts can be bound to events (experience-near) , in which case they are supported by bilateral MTL structures (perhaps in particular, the hip- pocampus and parahippocampal cortex) . Or, they can be associated with personally known people, places, and objects (experience-far) and critically depend on the left AVTL (for a related viewpoint, Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012; Reagh and Ranganath, in press) . In contrast, per- sonal trait knowledge represents categorical knowledge about the self that is extracted from facts and events and is supported by neural re- gions that are implicated in basic level categorical knowledge or schema-like knowledge, including, but perhaps not limited to, the medial prefrontal cortex (Marquine et al. , 2016) . 4. 2. The left AVTL: evidence for a shared mechanism of personal and general semantics In addition to demonstrating defective knowledge of experience-far autobiographical facts, MK was also impaired in the retrieval of unique semantic knowledge of famous places and people. These results, therefore, can be viewed as additional support for the notion that personal semantics share cognitive and neural mechanisms with gen- eral semantics (Renoult et al. , 2012) , with one point of convergence being the retrieval of experience-far semantic facts about singular en- tities. In other words, the personal and general semantic findings raise 185 Neuropsychologia 117 (2018) 178-187 the possibility that the left AVTL has a central role in the retrieval of semantically unique, spatiotemporal independent knowledge, with the critical factor being level of specificity to an entity rather than semantic domain (e. g. , personal vs. non-personal, living vs. non-living) . In this sense, our findings are consistent with the notion that the left AVTL serves as a domain-general and modality-independent hub for semantic knowledge (Patterson et al. , 2007; Lambon Ralph et al. , 2017) . Fol- lowing damage to the left AVTL, the retrieval of idiosyncratic semantic details that differentiate between individual personal and non-personal entities is lost while the ability to activate common semantic features shared with other items within the category is preserved. This leads to a specificity gradient across all semantic domains and tasks characterized by the preservation of basic level category compared to specific knowledge. Because of the extensive neural damage in MK, we cannot determine which AVTL subregions contributed to his deficit in retrieving unique personal and non-personal semantic knowledge. We note, however, that neuroimaging studies have implicated both anterolateral and anterior ventromedial temporal lobe regions in the retrieval of specific in- formation in the general semantic domain (Grabowski et al. , 2001; Gorno-Tempini and Price, 2001; Brambati et al. , 2010; Ross and Olson, 2012; Rogers et al. , 2006; Tyler et al. , 2004; Clarke and Tyler, 2014) . We also point out that it will be important to determine the extent to which more basic level category knowledge of the self overlaps with such knowledge in the general semantic domain. MK and DW per- formed largely within normal limits on neuropsychological tests of basic level general semantic knowledge, as well as personal trait knowledge. However, on the basis of this data, we cannot conclude that there is a singular neural network that supports these types of knowl- edge. For instance, personal trait knowledge is associated with the medial prefrontal cortex (Martinelli et al. , 2013; Marquine et al. , 2016) , but the role of this region in the retrieval of basic level category knowledge in the general semantic domain is unclear. 4. 3. Understanding experience-far, experience-near, and episodic autobiographical contents Although the main focus of the present study was the organization of personal semantics, additional findings from our assessment of epi- sodic autobiographical memory are worth noting. Both DW and MK were impaired in comparison to the controls, but MK's episodic auto- biographical memory was less severely impaired relative to his ex- perience-far autobiographical fact knowledge in the retrograde domain. These findings are broadly consistent with the autobiographical memory profile linked to mild stages of semantic dementia (Hodges et al. , 1992) , which is a reasonable comparison given the location of MK's lesion. On the basis of the experience-near versus experience-far framework (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2014, 2016) , it would be interesting to determine whether isolated damage to the left AVTL would selectively disrupt the storage and retrieval of experience-far autobiographical facts, largely sparing experience-near facts and episodic auto- biographical memories. The results also are in line with the idea that subsystems of the autobiographical memory neural network may be specialized for different types of autobiographical contents (Andrews- Hanna et al. , 2010, 2014) . Overall, they highlight the need for research on disorders of autobiographical memory in the context of isolated le- sions and dementias, because different patterns of autobiographical memory impairment could emerge depending , Rudrauf, D. , 2015.

Personal semantics: is it distinct from episodic and semantic memory? An electrophysiological study of memory for autobiographical",
        "other": "meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies showed that there are differences in peak activations associated with the retrieval of these two types of personal semantic memory (Martinelli et al. , 2013) . Specifically, per- sonal trait knowledge is prominently linked to medial prefrontal cortex, whereas autobiographical facts are related to more distributed activa- tions within the autobiographical memory network, including the left anterior and lateral temporal lobe (Martinelli et al. , 2013) . In prior research to compare the neural bases of these two types of personal semantic memory, autobiographical facts have been treated as a unitary construct with a single underlying neural substrate. However, recently this idea has been challenged (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2014, 2016) . According to Grilli and Verfaellie, some autobiographical facts are not completely separated from the spatiotemporal context from which they were derived and therefore are episodic-like or experience- near (e. g. , I run on Saturdays) . In contrast, experience-far auto- biographical facts (e. g. , names of my children) are devoid of any spa- tiotemporal context and thus are more similar to other types of con- ceptual knowledge. In line with this theoretical framework, a neuropsychological study found that the retrieval of experience-near autobiographical facts, but not experience-far autobiographical facts, was impaired in individuals with medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2016) . One important implication of these find- ings is that treatment of autobiographical fact knowledge as a unitary type of memory may amplify differences with personal trait knowledge. Specifically, prior neuropsychological studies of individuals with MTL amnesia showing that autobiographical facts and personal traits dis- sociate may have been driven by deficient retrieval of experience-near autobiographical facts (Klein et al. , 2002; Tulving, 1993) . Indeed, there have been no previous attempts to directly compare experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits in individuals with neurolo- gical damage. As such, it is unclear whether the relative differences in regional brain activation for autobiographical facts (broadly defined) and personal traits documented in neuroimaging studies (Martinelli et al. , 2013) reflect a genuine dissociation between the neural sub- strates of experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits specifically. Based on the experience-near versus experience-far framework, it is unclear what, if anything, separates experience-far autobiographical facts from personal trait knowledge at a cognitive and neural level. On the one hand, experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits are similar in that they can be viewed as conceptual forms of auto- biographical memory, with the majority of their features overlapping with general semantics more than episodic memory. From this per- spective, these two types of personal semantic knowledge may rely on similar neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval. On the other hand, despite both being conceptual, experience-far autobiographical facts and personal traits appear to vary in regard to the level of specificity at which they represent knowledge about the self. Experience-far auto- biographical facts can be considered fairly idiosyncratic; they capture knowledge of a particular entity that is personally known, including people, places, and objects (e. g. name of first employer, favorite subject in high school) . Personal traits, in comparison, can be thought of as more basic or general attributes of the self, because they are abstract and stable, and they can cut across multiple contexts involving different people, places, and activities (e. g. , being curious is not usually specific to one social relationship, place, or time) (Conway, 2005; Grilli, 2017) . Indeed, some models propose that personal trait knowledge is extracted from autobiographical facts and episodic memories, providing a higher- order level of organization of autobiographical memory (Conway, 2005; Klein and Lax, 2010) . From this perspective, relative to personal trait knowledge, experience-far autobiographical facts may be more dependent on neural mechanisms that are necessary for retrieving specific attributes of an entity. 179 Neuropsychologia 117 (2018) 178-187 1. 3. Contribution of the left anterior ventrolateral temporal lobe to non- personal and personal semantics Personal semantics are believed to share some cognitive and neural mechanisms with general semantics (Renoult et al. , 2012) . Therefore, it is noteworthy that in the domain of general semantics, the left anterior ventrolateral temporal lobe (AVTL) is thought to be particularly critical for the retrieval of semantic attributes that are highly specific to sin- gular entities (e. g. , knowing a famous person's name or the name of a landmark) (Abel et al. , 2015; Ross and Olson, 2012; Tranel, 2006, 2009) . For instance, left AVTL damage secondary to focal lesions or semantic dementia has been associated with , 2010; Hodges et al. , 1992; Ivanoiu et al. , 2006; Nestor et al. , 2002; Philippi et al. , 2015) , the contribution of this region to experi- ence-far facts is unclear. Notably, most studies have not separated ex- perience-far from experience-near facts, and they have investigated individuals with semantic dementia and temporal lobe epilepsy/lo- bectomy, two populations in which lesions to the MTL are not un- common. As such, it is difficult to know if impaired retrieval of ex- perience-near facts has confounded the apparent relation of autobiographical fact retrieval to the left AVTL. Grilli and Verfaellie (2016) found that the generation of experience-far autobiographical facts in an open-ended narrative task was numerically reduced in two individuals with lesions extending from the medial to lateral temporal lobes, but the discrepancy from controls was not statistically significant. In fact, studies that have isolated experience-far autobiographical facts and found significant impairment have relied on retrieval fluency (Lah et al. , 2004; Piolino et al. , 2003) , which can be globally disrupted by AVTL lesions (Martin et al. , 1990) . Therefore, the contribution of the left AVTL to experience-far autobiographical facts may be clarified by using a direct, non-fluency based assay of this type of knowledge. Unlike autobiographical fact knowledge, few neuropsychological studies have investigated the storage and retrieval of personal trait knowledge in individuals with AVTL damage. Although Duval and colleagues (Duval et al. , 2012) demonstrated that individuals with se- mantic dementia can generate core identity = 122 High Average std = 84 Low Average Logical Memory I 15 ss=5 Impaired 16 ss=6 Low Average Logical Memory II 7 ss=4 Impaired 6 ss=3 Impaired Verbal Paired Associates I 8 ss=4 Impaired 14 ss=5 Impaired Verbal Paired Associates II 4 ss=5 Impaired 4 ss=5 Impaired Designs I 91 ss=14 High Average 50 ss=6 Low Average Designs II 55 ss=10 Average 35 ss=5 Impaired Visual Reproduction I 40 2 Average 26 Impaired Visual Reproduction II 22 Average 4 Impaired Spatial Addition 21 6 Superior 16 2 Average Symbol Span 24 ss=10 Average 18 Average Auditory Memory Index std = 67 Impaired 69 Impaired Visual Memory Index std = 107 Average = 69 Impaired Visual Working Memory Index std = 117 High Average 100 Average Immediate Memory Index std =91 Average std = 70 Impaired Delayed Memory Index std = 80 Low Average std = 61 Impaired Basic level category knowledge Animal fluency 17 z=-11 Low Average 24 2=0. 5 Average Boston Naming Test 51 z= -18 Impaired 54 z= -08 Low Average Cambridge Naming Test 63 z= -0. 6 Average 64 2=0. 6 Average Notes: ss = scaled score; z = z-score; std = standard score; WAIS-IV = Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition (Wechsler, 2008) ; WMS-IV = Wechsler Memory Scale 4th Edition (Wechsler, 2009) ; Normative scores for Boston Naming Test and animal fluency were taken from Heaton and colleagues (Heaton et al. , 2004) . The Cambridge Naming Test norms are based on a group life, n = 10) components. Although the recent life period allows par- ticipants to recall semantics from up to 5 years ago for a few questions, for all participants we restricted responses to 2013-2016, since this reflected the post-incident (anterograde) period for both temporal lobe lesion participants. Consistent with the AMI manual, accuracy of re- sponses was not confirmed. Therefore, correct responses reflect answers that are consistent with the autobiographical content being targeted. In accordance with prior studies, we assessed consistency of self- descriptiveness judgments of traits to measure personal trait knowledge (Klein and Lax, 2010; Marquine et al. , 2016; Tulving, 1993) . This task required judging 84 personality traits on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all; 4= definitely) on 2 occasions spaced approximately 1 week apart (session 1 and session 2) . The questionnaire consisted of words selected from a pool of normalized personality trait adjectives (Anderson, 1968) . Half of the traits in the questionnaire were positive and half were ne- gative, which was defined on the distribution of the normative ratings (i. e. , first 252 were positive, 253-555 were negative) . To assess both 2 We determined that 6 points on the AMI are clearly experience-near (e. g. , place where one married) . However, the remaining 27 points cannot be definitively categorized as experience-near or experience-far, because they depend on personal life contexts (e. g. , one s address after marriage could be experience-near if marriage marked a move/life change, or it facts about people (e. g. , spouse or children) , living locations, and other life experiences for four individuals: President Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Paul McCartney, and Michael Jackson. We selected these four individuals because both MK and DW were able to identify them by name and profession on the basis of headshot photographs. Six facts were assessed per non-personal unique entity for a total score of 24 facts. 2. 2. 3. Episodic autobiographical memory We used the AMI to measure episodic autobiographical memory. The AMI measures episodic memory with what is referred to as the Autobiographical Incident Schedule, which requires participants to retrieve three episodic memories from childhood, adulthood, and re- cent life (total of nine memories) . Each memory receives a score of 0-3 on the basis of spatiotemporal specificity, with a maximum total score of 27. The AMI scores were separated into retrograde (childhood and adulthood, n = 18) and anterograde (recent life, n = 9) components. M. D. Grilli et al.

Concluding remarks In summary, recent findings from functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have indicated that the cognitive and neural bases of personal semantic memory are similar to both episodic M. D. Grilli et al. memory and general semantic memory (Grilli and Verfaellie, 2016; Renoult et al. , 2012) . The results presented here suggest that specific, spatiotemporal independent knowledge of the self (i. e. , experience-far autobiographical facts) depends on the left AVTL for storage and re- trieval, similar to semantic memory for non-personal unique entities. Also similar to semantic memory in the non-personal domain, the left AVTL does not seem to play as critical of a role in the retrieval (and possibly updating) of basic level category knowledge about the self (i. e. , personal traits) . Overall, our findings support the idea that personal semantic memory is not a unitary construct but rather consists of sub- types that vary in the extent to which they rely on core neural regions of the autobiographical memory network (Renoult et al. , 2012) . Further- more, our results provide evidence for the hierarchical organization of both personal and non-personal semantics (Grilli et al. , 2018) and document the greater vulnerability of specific compared to basic level category information within both domains following AVTL damage.

Background Human memory is a complex mechanism by which we perceive, store, and retrieve information received from previous knowledge or experiences. It is a function of the intricate neuronal pathway with significant overlap with limbic system that deals with emotions. Mammil- lary bodies (MBs) are paired diencephalic structures located posterior to the hypothalamus and are a part of Papez circuit. It is traditionally considered a relay-only station for hippocampal projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei via mammillothalamic tract (MTT) with no function of its own.

' Hereby, we present the first case report of isolated left MB infarct leading to partial global amnesia affecting both anterograde and retrograde memory. Case Presentation A 53-year-old, right-handed, African-American man with past medical history of hypertension was initially brought to the emergency department for acute-onset of confu- sion and memory deficit. At baseline, the patient had no neuropsychiatric deficits and was enjoying a normal life. On the morning of his presentation, he dropped his daugh- ter off at school, and later was asking his wife where his daughter was. He also inquired about a family member who had passed away recently, and he had attended his funeral. In the emergency department, the patient denied having any neurologic deficit while exhibiting symp- toms of amnesia. He was a chronic smoker and occasional drinker and was non-compliant with his hypertension med- ication (Tribenzor: olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/5 mg/12. 5 mg) . The rest of the patient s medical history was unremarkable. e50 Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, Vol. 26, No. 3 (March) , 2017: pp e50-e52 ISOLATED MAMMILLARY BODY INFARCT CAUSING GLOBAL AMNESIA e51 A.

Corre- sponding drop in apparent diffusion coefficient sequence confirms the presence of cytotoxic edema secondary to an acute infarct (B) . A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence also reveals corresponding hyperintensity in the left mammillary body (C) . On arrival, the patient s blood pressure was 164/ 98 mm Hg. The rest of his vital signs were within normal limits. His examination revealed disruption of short- term memory with severe anterograde and mild-moderate retrograde components in addition to anosognosia. The rest of his neurologic examination was within normal limits. The patient s initial laboratory findings were signifi- cant for slightly elevated serum body urea nitrogen of 22 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1. 6 mg/dL, and plasma glucose of 147 mg/dL. His remaining laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, were within normal range. Mag- netic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a small punctate acute infarct in the left MB (Fig 1) . Magnetic resonance angiogram was reported unremarkable; however, on close review, it was observed to have left proximal posterior cerebral artery (PCA) focal stenosis (Fig 2) . The patient s transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 65%, normal atrial sizes, and no evidence of thrombus. He was started on aspirin and statin. At 3-month follow-up, the patient continued to have amnesia, which was predominantly anterograde. Continuation of his symp- toms beyond 24 hours differentiated it from commonly seen entity transient global amnesia. * Figure 2. Magnetic resonance angiogram time of flight reconstruction image reveals the presence of the left fetal posterior cerebral artery with dimi- nution versus occlusion of the left P1 segment (A) . The presence of minimal flow on source images in the left P1 segment was confirmed on source images (B) . Discussion Memory is one of the most fascinating and vital func- tions of the brain. A significant amount of knowledge regarding the complex pathways involved in memory has been derived from the lesions in human as well as animals. Memory regions are primarily composed of medial tem- poral areas (hippocampal and parahippocampal gyri) and medial diencephalic areas (MBs, anterior thalamic nuclei, and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei) . MBs are a paired struc- ture located just posterior to the hypothalamus. They receive hippocampal inputs and convey it to the anteri- or and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus via MTT to play a significant role in emotions and memory. Recent studies have revealed that non-hippocampal projection from the limbic midbrain via the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden is vital to an MB s contribution to memory, as shown in Figure 3. ' Often, the lesions involving MBs involve adjacent MTT or thalamic nuclei; hence, the exact role of the MB in memory remains elusive. A recent study of 12 patients with thalamic amnesia revealed that damage to MTT produces severe memory impairment as com- pared with damage to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Much implicated anterior nucleus of the thala- mus was found to be damaged in only 1 out of the 12 e52 Hippocampal Fornix formation Entorhinal cortex Mamillary | boules S. MALE AND R.

A simplified flowchart representation of updated Papez circuit involved in memory consolidation. Hippocampal pathways project to anterior thalamic nuclei. Later, thalamic projection provides input to cingulate gyrus and reaches back to hippocampal formation via entorhinal cortex. The figure shows that the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden makes reciprocal connections with mammillary body, providing non-hippocampal projections and possibly playing a vital role in memory independent of hippocampal pathways. Conduction tracts Fornix, Mammillothalamic tract, and Mamillary peduncle and mamillotegmental tract are represented above the respective arrows. patients. However, none of those patients had damage to the MB. Our patient, in fact, had one of the rare iso- lated lesions of the left MB with sparing of surrounding MTT and thalamic nuclei. This lesion left the patient with partial but global amnesia, strongly suggesting the vital role of the MB in memory encoding and retrieval. There was no apparent deficit in executive function, but the pres- ence of anosognosia indicates interruption of thalamic projection of MBs. Our patient s magnetic resonance images (Fig 1) were a replica of a case reported by Amuluru et al; however, the clinical deficit was restricted to antero- grade amnesia. MB receives its blood supply from perforators originating from proximal PCA (P1 segment) or posterior communicating artery. In our patient, he had a diminutive left P1 segment with left fetal PCA (Fig 2) . Although animal experiments and functional neuroimaging continue to enhance our knowledge regarding the MB anatomy, its function, and its connections, lesion studies are equally important in further characterization.

        "case_report": "NOTE CO-OCCURRENCE OF EXECUTIVE IMPAIRMENT AND AMNESIC SYNDROME FOLLOWING SUB ARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE: A CASE STUDY Jonathan Wheatley and Joanna McGrath (Clinical Psychology Department, Rivermead Rehabilitation Centre, Oxford) ABSTRACT This case study presents a 37 year old man, P. P. , who shows evidence of both profound executive impairment and diencephalic amnesia associated with two discrete lesion sites following a Sub Arachnoid Haemorrhage. The executive impairment is unusual in type and severity, amounting to a gross impairment in the initiation and organisation of action. The thalamic lesion provides a rare example of diencephalic damage resulting in an extensive retrograde amnesia of the type that is often associated with Korsakoff s syndrome, but which in this case is not associated with prolonged alcohol abuse. Some of the problems caused by the co-occurrence of two such profound and disabling impairments are discussed. INTRODUCTION Problems with planning, initiating, and monitoring activity are often seen in clinical practice in association with damage to the frontal lobes (Bianchi, 1922; Luria, 1966; Damasio, 1979; Shallice, 1982; Goldberg and Bilder, 1987) . These problems can span a wide range of behaviours. Baddeley (1986) has suggested the term dysexecutive syndrome to describe the functional deficits that can arise as a result of such damage, explaning them in terms of an impairment of the central executive component of working memory. Although there has been much theoretical discussion of these functional deficits (e. g. Duncan, 1986) , there have been very few detailed studies of such patients. The studies that do exist have little in common with each other. Baddeley and Wilson (1988) were the first to apply the term dysexecutive syndrome when describing a patient, R. J. , who following a head injury, demonstrated an impaired ability to plan and apply strategies. Since their paper a number of reports have described patients who are said to show executive impairment, and who display a wide variety of cognitive deficits including perseveration, impulsivity, lack of initiation, poor self monitoring, and difficulty shifting set. For example Shallice and Burgess (1991) presented 3 vignettes of head injured patients who are unable to act effectively on their own initiative except in the most routine of activities. Three separate case studies have been made of patients with Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (H. S. E. ) whose dysexecutive syndrome underlies their severe behavioural disturbance (Alderman and Ward, 1991; Alderman and Burgess, 1994; Alderman, Fry and Youngson, 1995) . In most of these cases lesion sites were not restricted to the frontal lobes, and each of these patients had very different clinical characteristics, displaying a variety of cognitive deficits and behaviours. For example only two were reported to show perseveration, and whilst the H. S. E. patients were described as showing very disturbed behaviour and poor self-monitoring capacity, R. J. and the patients of Shallice and Burgess did not show behavioural problems, but were thought to be impaired in their ability to plan and apply strategies. There are so few documented cases, and the clinical pictures are so diverse that it may be more useful at present to speak of a range of executive impairments rather than a single Cortex, (1997) 33, 711-721 712 Jonathan Wheatley and Joanna McGrath syndrome. It may be that the term dysexecutive syndrome , originally conceived as a provisional descriptive term, has established itself in neuropsychological vocabulary prematurely, in the absence of sufficient empirical evidence. The subject of the present case study shows extensive executive impairment, particularly with regard to the initiation of even routine everyday activities, together with an amnesic syndrome. In contrast to the dysexecutive syndrome , the amnesic syndrome is the subject of a large theoretical and empirical literature. Parkin and Leng (1993) describe the defining characteristics of the amnesic syndrome as follows: (1) No evidence of impaired immediate memory as measured by tasks such as digit span. (2) Largely intact intellectual functions and semantic memory. (3) A severe and permanent anterograde amnesia. (4) Retrograde amnesia for information acquired before the brain damage was sustained, the extent of which varies across patients. (5) Intact procedural or implicit memory. It is now accepted that there are a number of critical lesion sites that can give rise to a global amnesic deficit. The syndrome can arise from lesions centred on the midline diencephalic nuclei or the medial temporal lobe, and some authors argue that lesions in different areas can give rise to qualitatively different types of amnesia. Parkin (1984) has suggested, from an extensive overview of the literature, that there are significant differences between diencephalic and temporal lobe amnesics. Most notably, diencephalic amnesics often confabulate and show a lack of insight and concern about their memory disorder, whilst these symptoms are rarely associated with temporal lobe amnesia. Although po ereen of retrograde amnesia associated with temporal lobe amnesia tends to be much more variable. A temporal gradient is also more usually seen following diencephalic damage, with memory for experiences prior to the onset of illness being especially impaired. The subject of the present case study is of clinical and theoretical interest for the following reasons. First, this case is unusual in the literature as it demonstrates two very severe and disabling neuropsychological conditions, occurring in association with two discrete lesion sites. Secondly, in this case the amnesia results from a rare non-Korsakoff unilateral diencephalic lesion. Finally, the pattern and the extent of the executive impairment to be described here is unlike any presented to date, and potentially makes a significant contribution to the understanding of frontal lobe damage and executive function. Case REPORT P. P. , a 37 year old right handed male who has worked previously as a design draughtsman, was admitted for rehabilitation 8 months after suffering a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage which occurred as a complication of a standard transphenoidal hypophysectomy to remove a non functioning pituitary adenoma. Apart from mild weakness in the right arm, his motor ability was left largely intact. In the early stages of recovery staff became concerned that he was withdrawn, confused, and impoverished in his activity. C. T. and M. R1I. scans revealed Evidence of Executive Impairment Over a two year period P. P. showed profound and persisting difficulty in initiating basic activities of daily living. He did not get out of bed, wash, eat or drink, use the toilet or engage in therapy unprompted. More often than not he was verbally and physically resistant to the nursing staff who attempted to engage him in these activities. When requested to carry out an activity he often agreed and expressed an intention to do it in a minute , but appeared to be unable to act on his intention. (It is uncertain as to whether or not he genuinely believed that he could perform these activities unaided) . For example he would Executive impairment and amnesic syndrome 713 Fig. 1. M. RII. scan of P. P. showing infarcts in the right thalamus and medial aspect of the right frontal lobe. old an electric shaver in his hands and sit in front of a mirror, verbally expressing an intention to shave himself, but apparently unable to initiate doing so. He sometimes aske: staff to supply him with the first step towards a goal, for example sitting up in bed before getting out completely. When nursing staff withdrew prompts for controlled experimenta periods he would soil his bed daily, and remain in a soiled bed for a number of hours unti staff intervened. P. P. s motor ability was grossly intact, but he went everywhere in a wheelchair which was pushed by members of staff. Only once in his stay (and for no obvious reason) did he leave his room without a member of staff or a relative prompting and accompanying him. His washing and dressing was mostly carried out by members of the nursing staff, even though he was physically capable of doing this for himself and found intervention from others aversive. His most frequent request was to be left alone. These behaviours became a severe management problem in the rehabilitation centre. Despite such gross problems with the executive tasks of planning and initiating activity, there was no evidence of either impulsivity or perseveration (which are also often associated with higher order executive impairment) in P. P. s behaviour. The deficit in planning action appeared to be at a more general level and more pervasive than that normally described as apraxia. P. P. showed such a poverty of activity that endocrine and psychiatric explanations for his behaviour were considered. P. P. was throughout this period being treated with hormone replacement therapy (testosterone) , however careful recording showed no relationship between the administering of this hormone and P. P. s impoverished behaviour. However, there was some suggestion from direct care staff that H. R. T. related to the degree of aggression rather than passive resistance that P. P. showed in response to being required to 714 Jonathan Wheatley and Joanna McGrath initiate action. In addition he was examined by several psychiatrists who concluded that he did not suffer from depressed mood. In fact, in social situations PP would occasionally appear quite jovial and socially skilled. His behaviour on these occasions suggested mild social disinhibition. It is striking that although he was occasionally very responsive to social stimuli, and at times clearly enjoyed social interactions, he never initiated such interaction himself. Neuropsychological Investigation P. P. was extremely difficult to test, as he was often resistant to structured interaction of any kind. There were, however, some few occasions when he was in good humour, talkative, and cooperative, and it was only on these occasions that he could be investigated. He engaged well in testing and appeared to enjoy success; this suggests that his test results are not attributable to poor motivation or lack of engagement. The results of all tests which were attempted are given in Table I. TABLE I Neuropsychological Test Results. Test Raw score Scaled score | Comments NART. 37 117 Premorbid W. A. I.

P. s relatively good performance on some neuropsychological tests indicate that he does not suffer from global cognitive impairment. However his test performance is also consistent with the presence of profound executive impairment. P. P. was able to respond intelligently when given a framework e. g. a choice between fixed alternatives, but not when a response required planning and initiation. Particularly striking is the contrast between: 1) His above average vocabulary level (N. A. R. T. , Shipley-Hartford) and almost total absence of verbal fluency (F. A. S. test) . Despite having a well preserved vocabulary evident in his every day conversation and the ability to name low frequency objects to confrontation on the Oldfield-Wingfield test (100% accuracy) , P. P. performed poorly on the F. A. S. test of verbal fluency in which he was asked to generate as many words as he could beginning with a particular letter in 60 seconds. He was only able to generate one word in response to the first cue letter, and none for the second on third, saying simply there must be loads of them . This is a similar response to that of the patient R. J. reported by Baddeley and Wilson (1988) . 2) His ability to process complex designs, evident in his relatively good score on Raven s Coloured Progressive Matrices, and the inability to construct a complex design (Rey Osterrieth) . The score obtained on the matrices is at the level of an 11 year old of above average ability in terms of the original norms for this test, and below average for a Executive impairment and amnesic syndrome 715 Fig. 2. Copy of Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure. After drawing this P. P. said, I can t and put down the pencil. normal adult of this age (Yeudall et al. , 1986) . Nevertheless P. P. persisted with the task and his responses were at well above chance level. Despite this he seemed unable to organise his response to generate a copy of the Rey Osterrieth complex figure. Given unlimited time he could only generate the bare outlines (see Figure 2) . P. P. s ability to perform the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test with ease can be attributed to this task requiring reactive cognitive flexibility, in contrast to the spontaneous cognitive flexibility required by the verbal fluency test (Eslinger, 1995) . This is consistent with the difficulty in initiating action, but absence of perseverative behaviour noted in his everyday life. It is also consistent with P. P. s ability to respond to strong social cues and structure at times such as a Christmas party, in which he fully participated to the extent of dancing with a member of staff when asked. In conclusion, clinical observation and neuropsychological testing both strongly suggested that P. P. had an impaired ability to plan and initiate action which is indicative of profound, and selective, executive impairment. Evidence of Amnesic Syndrome Nearly two years after the S. A. H. , and despite continued attempts to provide him with information about his current situation, P. P. remained disoriented for time and place. He often confabulated, for example stating that he was at college rather than in hospital, and claiming that hospital staff were fellow students. He showed some learning of staff names, but these were out of context with their identities. At other times he told staff that he was staying upstairs at an aunt s house, despite being able to see out of his window that he was 716 Jonathan Wheatley and Joanna McGrath on the ground floor. He consistently thought that the year was in the early 1980s, that his 11 year old daughter was only 5 years old, and that his dog, who died several years ago, was still a puppy. He denied ever having lived in the area that he lived in for three years prior to his illness. When told factual information about recent events he expressed surprise, and minutes later needed to be told the information again. Such severe and persistent disorientation and confabulation is consistent with diencephalic amnesia. Neuropsychological Investigation Testing revealed profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia (see Table II) . Despite normal forward digit span, recall of the Wechsler Logical Memory paragraphs was minimal under immediate and absent under delayed conditions. Similarly, P. P. s performance on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (Wilson et al. , 1985) indicates severely impaired episodic and prospective memory. The R. B. M. T. is an ecologically valid test of everyday memory tasks, and includes remembering a name, recognising faces, recognising designs, learning a new route, and remembering to perform certain tasks. Despite appearing well motivated and seeming to enjoy the test interaction, P. P. was unable to succeed on even the simplest sub-test. P. P. s performance on tests of remote memory was also poor. P. P. scored in the definitely abnormal range on the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman et al. , 1990) . As can be seen from Table II his memory was impaired for all three time periods covered, and his amnesia was most severe for his recent life. His poor performance on the Autobiographical Incidents sub scale can be attributed in part also to his initiation difficulties. P. P. s memory for public events/figures was investigated using the Dead or Alive test (Kapur et al. , 1989) . This test requires the subjects to say whether a public figure is dead or alive, and if dead, when and how he or she died. The results revealed the same pattern of remote memory impairment across all time periods, with performance being worst for the TABLE II Neuropsychological Assessment of Anterograde and Remote Memory Test Raw score Comments W.

The two tests give consistent results as the three time periods covered by the Dead or Alive test roughly correspond to those covered by P. P. s Autobiographical Memory Interview; P. P. s childhood occurred during the 1960s, and most of his early adult life in the 1970s. The results show a clear pattern of impairment for both personal and public information stretching back quite extensively, but with memory being especially poor for the most recent years. In summary, on testing P. P. conformed to the defining characteristics of the amnesic syndrome in general, and diencephalic amnesia in particular. He showed a severe anterograde amnesia on tests of recall, with extremely rapid forgetting, and an extensive retrograde amnesia. His amnesia was severe and persistent, and no clinical improvement was seen even at two years post onset. DISCUSSION On the basis of the evidence given it seems that P. P. demonstrates the co-occurrence of two severe neuropsychological conditions. A similar case has been made by Baddeley and Wilson (1988) in their study of R. J. , who seems to display a combination of classic amnesic deficit and executive impairment, which they term frontal amnesia . However R. J. s impairments were the result of a severe head injury leading to haemorrhage in both frontal lobes, and therefore damage that is likely to have been diffuse and involved other areas. The lesions sustained by P. P. are far more localised, so it can be argued with a greater degree of confidence that he exhibits two distinct impairments of a severity unusual in the literature. It might be argued that P. P. s memory impairment can be explained entirely by the presence of frontal lobe damage. However this does not explain the following observations. 1) The severity of the amnesic syndrome shown by P. P. While there is a growing literature on memory problems associated with frontal lobe damage (Shimamura et al. , 1991; Kesner et al. , 1995) documenting a wide range of memory deficits themselves possibly secondary to executive impairment, frontal damage alone is not associated with dense amnesia (Stuss et al. , 1994) . 2) Related to this, P. P. s ability to recognise was not clearly superior to his ability to recall. Patients with frontal lobe damage and dysexecutive problems are thought to be superior at recognition than recall tasks (see, for instance, Parkin, 1993) because recognition does not require active search and retrieval processes. The limited evidence available for P. P. is from the two easy recognition subtests of the R. B. M. T. Of these, he only just failed a face recognition task, but performed a picture recognition task at chance level. 3) The presence of extensive and persisting retrograde amnesia, which has not been reported in the literature in association with frontal damage unless diencephalic lesions are also present, but which has been reported in association with isolated diencephalic lesions (Becker et al. , 1990) . 4) P. P. confabulated. This may be associated with primary frontal famage (Stuss and Benson, 1984) but is more usually associated with dorsolateral lesions rather than medial lesions (Shimamura et al. , 1991) . Neuropsychological testing, C. T. data, and clinical observation of P. P. indicate the presence of a profound amnesia of the type reported to be associated with diencephalic damage. Particularly striking is the extensive retrograde amnesia. The case is potentially a significant contribution to the study of the amnesic syndrome for two main reasons. First, the lesion is unlilateral, right-sided and hence unusual. Severe global amnesia following such lesions has been reported only rarely (Fazio et al. , 1992) . Secondly, P. P. acquired damage to the thalamus which is not a result of Korsakoff s syndrome. Whilst there have been many studies of memory impairment in patients with thalamic damage resulting from Korsakoff s syndrome, there have been comparatively few studies of patients with non alcohol related causes of diencephalic damage. Such cases allow evaluation of the possibility that the extensive retrograde amnesia seen in Korsakoff s syndrome might be associated with prolonged periods of alcohol intoxication during which 718 Jonathan Wheatley and Joanna McGrath memories are not laid down, as was once suggested by several authors (Squire and Cohen, 1982; Butters and Albert, 1982) . This case provides evidence against this hypothesis as it implicates diencephalic damage as the direct cause of retrograde amnesia. Furthermore, the majority of the neuropsychological studies which do exist of patients with thalamic infarction resulting in persistent amnesia have tended to focus on anterograde memory (e. g. Winocur et al. , 1984; Guberman and Stuss, 1983) . In this present case the extent of the retrograde amnesia for both public and personal events has also been assessed. Earlier studies have also reported an extensive retrograde amnesia resulting from non-alcoholic amage to thalamic structures (Stuss et al. , 1988; Markowitsch et al. , 1993; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) . Graff-Radford et al. (1990) reported two bilateral thalamic infarct cases who showed severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia on testing, but whose functional memory deficits were less severe than those shown by P. P. Squire et al. (1989) carried out a detailed study of retrograde amnesia in a group which included one patient with bilateral thalamic infarcts, who is reported as showing a retrograde amnesia of approximately 15 years. As Hodges (1995) notes, this evidence implies that damage to structures within the iencephalon is critical for the production of retrograde amnesia, but further neuropsychological and radiological investigation will be needed to identify these structures. Thirdly, the executive impairment described in this study is perhaps more severe than any case presented in the literature so far. Like the patients presented by Shallice and Burgess (1991) P. P. was unable to act effectively on his own initiative but unlike them this extended to even the most basic daily activities. P. P. appeared unable to monitor his own performance and to use feedback from the environment to regulate his behaviour, like the H. S. E. patients described by Alderman et al. (1991, 1994, 1995) . However his primary behavioural disorder was a chronic apathy probably related to his initiation difficulties, rather than any motivational deficit, which made him resistant to most interventions from staff. This stands in contrast to the more florid disorders of aggression, sexual disinhibition, lack of social skills and repetitive speech displayed by the H. S. E. cases. This seemingly specific executive impairment is entirely consistent with the location of the frontal lesion, which although small, affects the areas thought to involve the selection of movements when there is no external cue to tell the subject when to move or what to do, in both monkeys (Passingham, 1993) and humans (Damasio and Van Hoesen, 1983) . P. P. s inability to plan and initiate action and to generate responses in a test situation implicates damage to the frontal lobes and a severe executive impairment. However he was able to perform the W. C. S. T. , a test which also requires executive processes, with ease. Eslinger et al. (1995) state that the W. C. S. T. is a test of reactive cognitive flexibility, whilst the F. A. S. test is a test of spontaneous cognitive flexibility. If P. P. s clearly profoun executive impairment is limited solely to the one aspect of cognitive flexibility and not the other, then perhaps we need to modify our understanding of executive function. P. P. s performance points to a possible dissociation between initiation and perseveration; between being unable to start an activity and unble to stop it. These two functions are conceptually similar, but may be mediated via different neural sites or circuits. It should also be note that the dorsolateral rather than orbito-medial frontal area has been implicated in the ability to perform the W. C. S. T. in both lesion and P. E. T. studies (Milner, 1963, 1964; Berman et al. , 1995) . Thus P. P. s preserved ability to perform the W. C. S. T. reflects the known site o damage. The case illustrates that the presentation of executive impairment can be very varied. Rather than referring to a single dysexecitive syndrome, it may be more useful to speak o: a range of executive deficits which can sometimes form distinct symptom clusters. Implications for Rehabilitation P. P. showed a lack of insight and concern over his disorder which is said to be typical of diencephalic amnesia. The executive impairment left him unable to initiate activity for himself, and the memory impairment left him with no understanding of why he needed help. This might explain why P. P. was uncooperative and often resistant to nursing and therapeutic intervention. Direct care staff, however, saw that P. P. was physically capable of performing activity, whilst the cognitive impairments which were preventing him were less Executive impairment and amnesic syndrome 719 visible. They also saw that he was apparently of normal intelligence with a good vocabulary, and so his confabulations at times could be misinterpreted as simple lies. In these circumstances the patient may come to be seen as manipulative or a malingerer, with behavioural rather than primarily cognitive problems. The results of neuropsychological investigation should be used to educate direct care staff and family members of the extent and practical implications of such impairments, which may otherwise lead to a misperception of the patient. Reality Orientation Training is a therapy which has been well established in use with the elderly and which has been recommended also for patients with acquired neurological impairment (Godfrey and Knight, 1987; Powell-Proctor and Miller, 1982; Kaschel, Zaiser- Kaschel, Sheil and Mayer, 1994) . The therapy focuses on reminding the patient of where they are, what the date is, and what is going on in the world around them. With patient P. P. a programme of prompting orientation information using fading cues was attempted daily over a five month period. This produced only negligible improvement. One reason for this was that P. P. became very distressed when confronted, however gently, by information as to his present situation and condition, to the extent that the therapy session would have to be terminated. Eventually it was decided that this form of orientation training was producing little gain, and was too distressing to the patient to warrant continuing. Another form of therapy often used with the elderly may well be more productive in such cases, when formal Reality Orientation is too threatening. Reminiscence Therapy (see Merriam, 1980) rather than emphasising the current situation of patients, attempts to link them with their past lives and achievements. This is less distressing as the patient is not forced to focus on what may well be unpleasant truths as to their current situation. Furthermore, the nature of the interaction is less threatening than Reality Orientation Training, in which the therapist holds information which the patient may not have. With Reminiscence Therapy the interaction is more of a collaboration between patient and therapist. Reminiscence therapy focusing on the 1970s and 1980s was attempted with P. P. , and he appeared happy and animated when engaged in such sessions. Evidence available on the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy with elderly patients indicates that it does not have a significant effect on memory function and, although pleasurable at the time, does not have persisting positive effects on mood or life satisfaction (Romaniuk, 1981; Thornton and Brotchie, 1987) . However few of the published studies give precise details of the therapeutic activity involved. A related but distinct approach is recommended by Baddeley and Wilson (1986) . This involves the formal reteaching of autobiographical information as one means of reducing the anxiety that often accompanies amnesia. They argue that self respect demands some coherent concept of the self, which to a great extent relies upon autobiographical memory. As they put it telling disorientated patients where they are at present and what the date is may not help very much because what they need to establish and maintain is not just where they are but who they are . This is certainly true of patient P. P. , as his diencephalic amnesia and executive impairment left him with no insight into either the nature of his disabilities or of the handicap that is secondary to them. Acknowledgements.

Smith, MD, MPH, FRCPC From the Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA (RNA) ; and Stroke Service, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA (EES) . ABSTRACT Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) can rarely be complicated by vascular and perivas- cular inflammation. Patients typically present with subacute cognitive decline, seizures, headaches, and hyperintensities on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Little is known about the cause and natural history of inflammatory CAA, but recent case series show that some patients respond well to steroids. Here, we describe a patient who presented with severe suba- cute encephalopathy and was diagnosed with probable CAA-related inflammation based on characteristic MRI, showing subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities with mass effect and multiple cortical microbleeds, after excluding other possible causes of subacute delirium. Mental status examination markedly improved after a course of intravenous methylpred- nisolone, initially without significant change in MRI appearance. An MRI 4 months later, however, showed marked reduction in the volume of white matter T2 hyperintensities. Mental status remained improved with mild residual retrograde and anterograde amnesia. We propose that the diagnosis of CAA-related inflammation should be considered in patients with profound subacute mental status changes and typical MRI findings. In steroid-responsive patients, clinical improvement can precede radiographic improvement. Keywords: Inflammatory, amyloid, an- giopathy, corticosteroids, encephalopa- thy, microbleeds.

While intrac- erebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most commonly recognized clinical manifestation of CAA, ! here, patients typically present with headache, subacute cognitive decline, and seizures. 2 Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in- clude hyperintensities on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated in- version recovery (FLAIR) , which corresponds with inflamma- tion, and susceptibility artifacts on T2 gradient-echo imaging, which represent typical cortical microbleeding. !> The cause of inflammatory CAA remains unknown. Recent case series show that some patients respond well to steroids. ?> The definite diagnosis of CAA-related inflammation can be made by neuropathological examination, which reveals inflam- matory cells, sometimes including multinucleated giant cells, surrounding or within CAA-affected vessels. ?* A recent study suggests that there is a typical MRI appearance of CAA-related inflammation consisting of confluent, often asymmetric, white matter T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities with mass effect and evi- dence of multiple lobar microbleeds on T2*-weighted gradient- echo MRI? Case Report A 92-year-old right-handed woman was referred to the emer- gency room for altered level of awareness. Mental status changes, including disinhibition and inappropriate behavior, were noted 3 weeks prior. Ten days prior to admission, she started making paraphasic errors. She tried to eat napkins, and occasionally had brief spells of decreased responsiveness. Con- ceptual apraxias developed (eg, she was not able to use ob- jects such as the telephone) . The day prior to presentation, she asked how her husband, who died 42 years earlier, was doing. In the emergency room, she was initially drowsy, inatten- tive, and later somnolent, and minimally responsive to sternal rub. Cranial nerve reflexes were intact. Brain MRI showed, in T2*-weighted gradient-echo images, numerous punctate foci of signal void restricted to the cortical white matter junctions (Fig 1) and, in T2-weighted and FLAIR images, white mat- ter hyperintensities (Fig 2) . Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in contrast-enhanced Tl-weighted images (Fig 3) . Electroencephalogram showed background slowing. Spinal fluid sampling showed protein level of 172 mg/dL, glucose level of 57 mg/dL, red blood cell count of 186 per mm (without xan- thochromia) , and white cell count of 1 per mm , Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Herpes, Varicella, and JC viruses were negative. Serum electrolytes and liver and renal func- tion tests were all normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 24. Antinuclear antibodies were detected at a dilution of 1: 1, 280. Anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were not present. There was no clinical evi- dence of systemic lupus erythematosis. Biopsy was offered but refused by the family. Given the clini- cal course, typical MRI findings, and lack of other explanation, she was diagnosed with probable CAA-related inflammation and received intravenous methylprednisolone (1, 000 mg per day for 5 days) , with marked improvement. She became at- tentive, oriented, and recognized her family members again. Copyright 2008 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 89 Fig 1. MRI gradient-echo sequence. Axial T2*-weighted gradient- echo images show numerous foci of signal loss, suggestive of mi- crobleeds, at the cortex-white matter junction (arrows) . There were still errors in naming and motor perseveration. Repeat MRI after 3 days of treatment, however, showed no sig- nificant change (Fig 2) . She was discharged on oral prednisone (60 mg per day with a plan to taper by 10 mg per day per month) . At 2-month follow-up, she was further improved. She was alert, oriented, and had no aphasia. There was amnesia for the hospital admission and the confusional state. On testing, she had impaired short term memory, recalling one out of three objects after 5 minutes. The rest of her neurological examina- tion was unremarkable. She was independent with activities of daily living, but was still residing in an assisted living facility because of her premorbid foot drop with impaired ambulation. Repeat MRI at 4 months showed a decrease in the volume of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the white matter (Fig 2) and resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement (Fig 3) . Her oral corticosteroids were further tapered without complication. Discussion CAA-related inflammation is a rare disease, which can present with subacute mental status change. ?> Diagnosis is difficult, and a definite diagnosis can be made only by biopsy. The differen- tial diagnosis of the clinical presentation is wide. Other causes of subacute encephalopathy should be ruled out by general med- ical examination, liver, renal, and thyroid function tests, CSF sampling, and EEG, as indicated. We advocate working up unexplained subacute mental sta- tus changes with a MRI, including a T2*-weighted gradient- echo sequence. In this sequence, the susceptibility effect of iron is enhanced and is more readily apparent, as focal sig- nal loss with resulting hypointensity, than on other sequences. A histopathological study shows a good correlation between punctuate foci of signal loss on the T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence and the presence of focal hemosiderin deposition on pathology, indicative of past microhemorrhage. When diag- nosing microbleeds on MRI, however, care should be taken to exclude regions of susceptibility effect from calcification or from cortical vessels, containing deoxygenated hemoglobin, seen in cross-section. When multiple lobar microbleeds are present, in the set- ting of unexplained subacute encephalopathy, and accompa- nied by large patchy or confluent white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities with mass effect, particularly when asymmet- ric, then CAA-related inflammation should be suspected. The MRI appearance of CAA-related inflammation appears rela- tively unique, but larger studies are needed to confirm its specificity. Brain biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of CAA-related in- flammation and to rule out other vasculitides. When brain biopsy cannot be obtained, as in our case, we advocate an empirical course of intravenous steroids because CAA-related inflammation has sometimes been associated with a dramatic clinical response. It has been previously noted that steroid- responsive patients also have white matter lesion volume re- duction on follow-up MRI? This was observed in our patient Fig 2. Reduction in white matter lesion volume by intravenous corticosteroids. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images show evolution of white matter lesions. Confluent white matter hyperintensities are present on FLAIR sequences at admission (A) and 3 days after intravenous methylprednisolone infusion (B) . Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences show increased diffusion within the areas of FLAIR hyperintensity, suggesting vasogenic edema (A, B) . There is a marked decrease in FLAIR and ADC hyperintensity volume at 4 months, particularly in the temporal lobes, with resolution of mass effect (C) . 90 Journal of Neuroimaging Vol 19 No 1 January 2009 Fig 3. Leptomeningeal enhancement on coronal T1-weighted im- ages following gadolinium contrast injection. Sulcal leptomeningeal enhancement (arrow) is seen on T1-weighted images, following gadolinium contrast injection, at admission (A) and 3 days after in- travenous methylprednisolone (B) . Enhancement is not seen at 4 months after admission (C) . but, interestingly, the clinical response to steroids substantially predated the MRI morphological response (Fig 2) . The role of longer-term immunosuppression remains to be established by studies with longer follow-up. References 1. Knudsen KA, Rosand J, Karluk D, Greenberg SM.

        "case_report": "Case Report Acute Amnesia due to Isolated Mammillary Body Infarct Krishna Amuluru, mp, *t Christopher G. Filippi, mp, t and Angela Lignelli, mpt Background: There are limited reports describing acute amnesia after mammillotha- lamic tract infarction. Furthermore, acute infarction isolated to the mammillary body has never been reported. We present the first case of anterograde amnesia after isolated acute infarction of the mammillary body in a patient without concurrent or prior thalamic or mammillothalamic tract injury. Methods: A retrospective review of the patient s electronic medical record including inpatient notes and all radiological examinations was performed. Results: A 50-year-old woman presented with acute onset of confusion and constant repetition of the same questions. Magnetic reso- nance (MR) imaging of the brain showed isolated acute infarct of the left mammil- lary body without concurrent abnormality of the thalamus or mammillothalamic tract. MR angiography showed severe stenosis of the proximal posterior cerebral ar- tery at the origin of the perforating mammillary artery. Conclusions: Isolated injury to the mammillary body is rare. In addition to recognized memory-related structures such as the thalamus and mammillothalamic tract, mammillary body injury may also play a role in memory dysfunction. Knowledge of the vascular supply of memory-related structures is important in diagnosing and understanding memory dysfunction.

She was constantly repeating the same questions and had difficulty forming new memories. She could recall that a plumber came to her house the morning of admission but she did not recall him leaving. On arrival, her temperature was 37 , blood pressure was 142/82 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 77 and regu- lar. On mental status testing, she was unable to recall 3 words 5 minutes after successful registration. Her neuro- logic examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, hepatic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine toxicity were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated left mammillary body restricted diffusion (Fig 1, A, B) . T2- weighted sequences demonstrated asymmetric enlarge- ment and abnormal hyperintensity of the left mammillary Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, Vol. 24, No. 10 (October) , 2015: pp e303-e305 e303 e304 body ( , C) . She was admitted with a differential that included stroke, seizure, atypical Wernicke encephalopa- thy, or an inflammatory process. A search for alternative etiology of her confusion, including infectious and meta- bolic workup, was negative. Continuous electroencepha- logram monitoring showed no epileptiform activity. Magnetic resonance angiography showed signal loss within the proximal left posterior cerebral artery (PCA; , D) . Her diagnosis was established as an acute mammillary body infarction due to high-grade stenosis of the left PCA. During her hospitalization, her examination remained unchanged. She had stable persistent difficulty with three-item recall and repeatedly failed to recognize the physician who examined her the prior day. Her lang- uage function was normal with normal fluency and pros- ody of speech, and intact naming and repetition without phonemic or semantic paraphasic errors. Her executive K. AMULURU ET AL.

Her vision was normal. Upon discharge on hospital day number 10, her anterograde amnesia was unchanged. Discussion The mammillary bodies lie at the posterior margin of the hypothalamus and are a part of the circuit of Papez, which also includes the hippocampal formation, anterior thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and their interconnections. Although Papez originally suggested that this pathway was the basis for emotion, current understanding sug- gests that it has a unique role in memory and cognition. Within this network of structures involved in memory, the anterior thalamic nuclei and the direct hippocampal anterior thalamic connections via the fornix are critical components. This is evidenced by several reports ACUTE AMNESIA DUE TO ISOLATED MAMMILLARY BODY INFARCT e305 showing that damage or disconnection of the anterior thalamic nuclei is consistently associated with profound memory and learning impairments in rodents and anter- ograde amnesia in humans. The anterior thalamic nuclei also receive input from the mammillary bodies via the mammillothalamic tract (MTT) . Animal model evidence has long suggested that the major participatory role of the mammillary bodies in anterior thalamic function is the indirect relay of extended hippocampal inputs to the anterior thalamus via the MTT. \" However, recent advances are changing the understanding of the independent importance of the mammillary bodies, the mammillothalamic tract, and their contribution to anterior thalamic function. In humans, the association of memory dysfunction with the mammillary bodies and the MTT continues to evolve. Tumor-associated damage to the mammillary bodies causing memory deficits has been reported; how- ever, these cases involved adjacent structures as well. There are only a few reports documenting memory dysfunction following MTT infarction in humans. ' Acute infarction isolated to the mammillary body has never been reported. We present the first case of anterograde amnesia after isolated acute infarction of the mammillary body in a patient without concurrent or prior thalamic or MTT injury. Our case differs from previously reported cases in that our patient s pathology was confined to the mammillary body. Park et al reported global amnesia due to unilateral infarct of the left MTT ina patient with prior anterior right thalamic hemorrhage. Yoneoka et al' reported Korsakoff syndrome due to left MTT ischemia in a patient with additional infarction involving the anterior left thalamus as well as prior right MTT injury. Similarly, Schott et al reported amnesia due to a left thalamic infarct with inter- ruption of the MTT. Not only did our patient s acute injury spare the thalamus and MTT, but she also had no prior injury to these regions. The mammillary body has a blood supply discrete from the MTT and thalamus. The MTT shares a common vascular supply with other memory-related structures such as the fornix, the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, and internal medullary lamina. \" It is supplied via the tuberothalamic artery, which arises from the posterior communicating artery. '' The mammillary body, however, is predominantly supplied by proximally perforating mammillary branches off the P1 segment of the PCA. '* In our patient, a thromboembolic event at the origin of the perforating mammillary artery caused an acute infarct of the mammillary body while sparing the MTT and thalamus. Determining the contribution of an individual structure to memory is difficult because it is rare to find isolated damage in a clinical setting. ' We present this case of anterograde amnesia due to isolated mammillary body infarct to elucidate this fascinating anatomical contribu- tion to memory. References 1.

January 1996; accepted 23 January 1996 Abstract We recorded auditory event-related potential (ERP) by using the standard oddball paradigm in seven amnestic patients. Patients were divided into three groups according to brain CT or MRI findings. (1) Three patients with no detectable lesion, including two patients studied during the episode of transient global amnesia, showed a well-defined P300. (2) Three patients with detectable lesions in the mesial temporal lobes did not show any wave form corresponding to P300. In two of these three patients, the ERP wave form showed a significant change in accordance with the improvement of MRI findings. (3) One patient who had a hypothalamic lesion due to total resection of craniopharyngioma showed a low-amplitude P300. Although neuropsychological examinations showed selective and severe impairment of recent memory function in all of these patients, no significant relationship was found between the degree of memory disturbance and P300 abnormality. These results suggest that P300 is more affected by existence and extension of brain lesions, especially in the mesial temporal lobes, rather than degree of memory disturbance. However, these results do not necessarily suggest that the potential generated in the mesial temporal lobes is directly recorded as a component of the scalp-recorded P300. Keywords: P300; Amnesia: Mesial temporal lobe lesion: Hippocampus; Memory 1. Introduction Event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by the auditory oddball paradigm are used for clinical assessment of pa- tients with various cognitive disorders. Among others, it is well known that the P300 component of ERPs shows prolonged latency in normal elderly people as well as demented patients (Pfefferbaum et al. , 1984a, b; Polich et al. , 1986) , and reduced amplitude in demented patients (Pfefferbaum et al. , 1984b) .

All rights reserved PH $0022-510X (96) 00035-4 remains unsolved as to which cognitive process or neural network is mainly related to generation of P300. Memory disturbance can be considered as the initial and most common symptom in many demented patients. Some in- vestigators suggested a close relationship between memory function and P300 generation (McCarthy and Donchin, 1981; Wickens, 1990; Verleger et al. , 1991) , but this issue still outside the mesial temporal lobe (Knight et al. , 1980; Altafullah et al. , 1986; Velasco et al. , 1986; Mc- Carthy and Wood, 1987; Stapleton and Halgren, 1987; Knight et al. , 1989; Puce et al. , 1989b; Knight, 1990; Smith et al. , 1990; Kropotov and Etlinger, 1991; Kropotov and Ponomarev, 1991; Neshige and Luders, 1992; Onofrj et al. , 1992b; Paller et al. , 1992) . Several studies demon- strated that normal scalp P300 could be recorded in pa- tients who underwent the resection of unilateral temporal lobe (Johnson and Fedio, 1987; Johnson, 1988) or who had extensive damage in the unilateral temporal lobe (Rugg et al. , 1991) . Other investigators showed a consistent P300 even in patients with damage in the bilateral mesial tempo- ral lobes (Onofrj et al. , 1991, 1992a; Polich and Squire, 1993) . They suggested that the mesial temporal lobe made a minimal contribution to human scalp P300. Here we report P300 in seven patients who had selec- tive impairment of memory function due to various causes, with or without detectable lesions in the mesial temporal lobe on imaging studies. The standard auditory oddball paradigm was employed. The subjects included two pa- tients with transient global amnesia (TGA) in whom ERP was recorded during the amnestic episode. Discussion will be focused on the influence of memory disturbance and the site of lesions on P300 generation. 2. Case description The subjects of the present study were seven patients all of whom had selective disorder of memory function due to various etiologies (Table 1) . Memory function of each patient except for Patient | was evaluated by the memory test battery including digit span, Miyake s Retention Test (MRT) , and Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) under Administration A. Results of memory function tests in each patient are summarized in Table 2. MRT is a verbal paired association test using Japanese words which con- sists of two subtests; one made of 10 pairs of highly related words and the other of 10 pairs of unrelated words. First, 10 pairs of related words were aurally presented to the subject at a natural speed. Immediately afterwards, the memory trial was performed in which the subject was requested to recall a matched word for each pair. If the subject made one mistake or more, the aural presentation of 10 pairs and memory trial were repeated as necessary, but 3 times at most. Then the test using 10 pairs of unrelated words was given similarly. The number of cor- rect answers obtained in the final trial for each subtest is shown in Table 2. All patients manifested severe anterograde and retro- grade amnesia of variable degrees at the time of examina- tion, as described below. Other neuropsychological func- tions were judged to be normal on clinical examinations. All patients were normal in understanding spoken and written words and did not show any difficulties in either speech or motor execution in their daily life. 2. 1. Patient 1 A 61-year-old right-handed female without any previ- ous neurological diseases was found in amnestic state as she was wandering in our hospital just following a gastric endoscopy. Neurological examination revealed severe an- terograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia which went back to about 6 h before the onset of the episode, but no other abnormality was found. She repeatedly asked why she was there, appearing restless and anxious. Digit span and remote memory were preserved. MRT and BVRT were not performed in order to carry out the ERP record- ing during the amnestic episode, which lasted for 12 h. Electroencephalogram (EEG) using nasopharyngeal elec- trodes, brain X-ray computed tomography (brain CT) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomogra- phy (SPECT) with \" Tc-p, t-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) were studied during the amnestic episode, and none of them showed abnormal findings. On the next day, she seemed to recover completely except for lack of memory about the episode of the previous day. She was diagnosed as TGA. ERP was recorded first during the episode (4 h after the onset of the episode) and then 2 months later. 2. 2. Patient 2 A 66-year-old right-handed female without any previ- ous neurological diseases was found amnestic in the urol- ogy department of our hospital on the day after surgery for ureterolithiasis which was carried out under spinal anesthe- sia without any problem. She was found to be suffering from anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia going back about 1 week. She could not recall the day when she was admitted (1 week prior) , but she remembered well what happened before admission. Digit span was normal (6 digits forward and 5 digits backward) . On MRT, 5 out of 10 pairs of related words were correctly recalled, but none of the 10 pairs of unrelated words could be recalled. The Number Correct Score (NCS) and Number Error Score (NES) of BVRT were 6 (full score 10) and 8, respectively. No other neurological abnormality was found.

Patient 3 A 19-year-old right-handed female without any previ- ous neurological diseases acutely developed high-grade fever, confusional state and generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with increased cell counts (15/mm?, 63% neu- trophil and 37% lymphocyte) but normal protein (28 mg/dl) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , and the diagnosis of viral encephalitis was made. As the confusional state improved and seizure decreased in frequency, selective memory disturbance became prominent. When she visited our clinic 2 months after the onset, she still had marked anterograde amnesia. She could not recall day-to-day events, and retrograde amnesia up to 6 months before the onset was also present. On the memory function tests, digit span was normal (6 digits forward and 5 digits backward) . 1-e On MRT, 7 correct pairs of related words and no correct pair of unrelated words could be answered. On BVRT, the NCS and NES were 5 and 7, respectively. EEG showed diffuse slow waves without any focal abnormalities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 82 days after onset of the disease did not show any abnormal findings on TI- or T2-weighted axial images. ERP record- ings were performed twice: 2 and 4 months after the disease onset, respectively. 2. 4. Patient 4 A 69-year-old right-handed female was referred to our clinic due to memory disturbance following viral en- cephalitis. Three months prior to the visit, she developed frequent gencralized tonic-clonic scizures and was admit- ted to another hospital. At that time, she appeared inatten- tive and inactive but did not have any focal neurological abnormalities. CSF study on the 17th day of the disease showed a slightly increased cell count (18/mm?, 93% lymphocyte) and normal protein (28 mg/dl) . CSF and serum antibody against herpes simplex virus (HSV) was Fig. |. MRI in Patients 4-7: (a) T2-weighted image in Patient 4 with viral encephalitis.

Honda et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 139 (1996) 95-105 99 negative. As her inactive state gradually improved, the memory disorder became prominent. MRI showed small localized lesions in the bilateral mesial temporal lobes just around the amygdala on T2-weighted and proton-density images (Fig. la) . At the time of her visit to our clinic, seizures were well controlled by anticonvulsants. She ap- peared well attended and active, but severe anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia going back to several months before the onset were observed. No other neurolog- ical abnormality was found. Memory function tests re- vealed a slightly impaired digit span only in the backward repetition (6 digits forward and 4 digits backward) , but recent memory was severely impaired; she could not recall any items out of 5 which were visually presented 5 min before. MRT showed 4 correct pairs of related words and no correct pair of unrelated words. On BVRT, the NCS and NES were 2 and 14, respectively. ERP recording was performed 3 months after the disease onset. 2. 5. Patient 5 A 55-year-old right-handed male was admitted to our hospital due to high-grade fever of | week duration and amnestic episode which started the day before admission. He was alert and there were no neurological deficits except for severe memory disturbance and total disorientation in time and place. EEG showed poorly organized background activity with slow waves in the temporal regions bilaterally independently. CSF study on the 17th day of the disease showed an increased cell count (25/mm*, 71% lympho- cyte, 8% monocyte and 21% neutrophil) , increased protein (152 mg/dl) and decreased glucose (30 mg/dl) . Serum and CSF antibody against HSV was positive. MRI showed large abnormal high-intensity lesions in the bilateral tem- poral regions on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1b) . He was diagnosed as herpes simplex encephalitis and treated by aciclovir. He appeared drowsy for 2 days after admission and then he became manic and restless which lasted for about 3 months. These symptoms gradually improved, but severe amnestic state remained. In the neuropsychological study which was performed 3 months after the disease onset, he showed severe anterograde amnesia and retro- grade amnesia of several years duration. Digit span was slightly impaired (5 digits forward and 4 digits backward) . He could answer only 2 correct pairs of related words and none of the unrelated words on MRT. On BVRT, the NCS and NES were 7 and 4, respectively. He could not cooper- ate on ERP recording at that time. Seven months after the disease onset, his memory function, especially retrograde amnesia, started to improve. Digit span was 7 tor forward repetition and 5 backward. MRT showed 7 correct pairs of related words and 4 of unrelated words. In BVRT, the NCS and NES were 6 and 5. MRI obtained 6 months after the onset showed atrophy of moderate degree in bilateral temporal lobes but no abnormal high-intensity lesion on T2-weightcd image (Fig. !c, d) . ERP recordings were per- formed twice: 7 and 9 months after the disease onset, respectively. 2. 6. Patient 6 A 32-year-old right-handed female had suffered from dermatomyositis for 6 months. Corticosteroid therapy was not effective, and liver function became abnormal. Follow- ing intravenous hyperalimentation, she became hypona- tremic (115 mEq/l) and developed generalized convul- sions. Soon after the serum sodium level was corrected, bulbar palsy and bilateral pyramidal tract sign appeared. Abnormal high-intensity lesions were observed in the cen- tral portion of pons and in the subcortical white matter regions diffusely on T2-weighted images of MRI. She was diagnosed as central pontine and extra-pontine myelinoly- sis at that time. Those neurological symptoms gradually improved, but 40 days after the first seizure episode she had a generalized convulsion during which apneic period lasted several minutes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successfully performed, but a somnolent state lasted for several days. As the consciousness became clear, promi- nent memory disturbance was discovered. On MRI which was taken 2 days after the anoxic episode, abnormal high-intensity lesions in the pons and other white matters markedly improved, but new widely distributed lesions were sccn in bilateral mesial temporal lobes including parahippocampal gyri (Fig. le) . Upon referral to our clinic 2 months after the anoxic episode, memory function tests revealed severe anterograde amnesia and retrograde amne- sia of 10 year duration. Digit span was normal (7 digits forward and 5 digits backward) . MRT showed 7 correct pairs of related words but no correct pair of unrelated words. On BVRT, the NCS and NES were 4 and 10, respectively. On the follow-up study performed 8 months after the episode, the retrograde amnesia improved from 10 years to 3 years, but anterograde amnesia did not change. On MRI which was taken 7 months after the anoxic episode, lesions in bilateral mesial temporal lobes. still existed although they were much smaller (Fig. If) . ERP recordings were done 2 and 8 months after the anoxic episode, respectively. 2. 7. Patient 7 A 31-year-old right-handed female was admitted to the neurosurgery ward of our hospital due to headache and amenorrhea-galactorrhea. Neurological examination re- vealed bitemporal hemianopsia and papilledema, but no neuropsychological disorder was present at that time. MRI showed a large mass lesion in the suprasellar region, partly extending to the left Monro s foramen (Fig. 1g) . Bilateral frontal craniotomy and total resection of craniopharyn- gioma were made. The pituitary stalk had to be amputated because of severe adhesion. After the operation she had high-grade fever, panhypopituitarism and diabetes in- 100 M. Honda et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 139 (1996) 95-105 sipidus. In addition, she was noted to have confabulation, disorientation in time and place, and memory disturbance (Korsakoff syndrome) . Neurological examination upon re- ferral to our department 2 months after the operation revealed anosmia on the right, and moderate anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia of 10 year duration. Con- fabulation was no longer present. She did not remember date, place and her physician s name. Digit span was 6 digits forward and 5 digits backward. MRT about related words showed full score, but the result of MRT about unrelated words was extremely poor; only one correct recall out of 10. She could recall only 1 out of 5 objects which were visually presented several minutes earlier. On BYRT, the NCS and NES were 8 and 2, respectively. These findings showed some fluctuation. MRI obtained after the operation showed no evidence of residual tumor, but it disclosed the structural lesion in the hypothalamic region as a result of the surgical procedure (Fig. 1h) . ERP recording was performed 2 months after the operation. 2. 8. Patient groups Patients were divided into three groups according to brain CT or MRI findings; no definite lesion (Patients 1-3) , bilateral temporal lobe lesions (Patient 4-6) and hypothalamic lesion (Patient 7) (Fig. 1) . None had any detectable lesions in the temporoparietal junction. 3. Methods In Patients | and 2, both of whom had TGA, ERPs were recorded both during the ongoing anterograde amnesia and also after the amnestic episode. In Patients 3, 5 and 6, ERP recordings were repeated 2-7 months after the first record- ing. The experiment was explained to each patient before- hand, and informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their families. The patients were seated in a reclin- ing armchair in an electrically shielded room under usual room light. They were instructed to hold a button gently in the right hand placed on the armrest and to push it with the thumb as soon as the target tone was heard (see below) . They were instructed to keep their eyes open, but in three patients (Patients 2, 4 and 6) who could not avoid frequent blinks, ERP recordings were performed with the eyes gently closed. A training session was given in all patients until they could distinguish the two different tones cor- rectly (see below) . Task performance was checked by pulses which were obtained at the time of each stimulus presentation and of button press both of which were drawn on an EEG paper. In this study, we have not done quantita- tive analysis of reaction time. The standard auditory oddball paradigm was employed. Two kinds of pure tone stimuli, 1000 Hz as non-target stimuli and 2000 Hz as target, were presented binaurally through the earphone. Hearing threshold for the target stimulus was established for each ear separately, and the stimulus intensity adopted was 45 dBSL (rise and fall time: 9. 9 ms; plateau time: 20 ms) . The interstimulus interval varied randomly between 2. 1 and 3. 1 s. Target stimuli were presented infrequently at a probability of 20%. The sequence of stimulus presentation was automati- cally controlled and random. Each session was stopped when the averaged number of target stimuli reached 20, and hence approximately 80 non-target stimuli were pre- sented in a session. At least two separate sessions were given to each patient in order to confirm the reproducibil- ity of the data. EEG was recorded by Ag/AgCl! shallow cup electrodes fixed with collodion on the scalp at 21 positions (Kp1, Kpz, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, Ol, Oz and O2) according to the International 10-20 System in five patients (Patients 3-7) . In the re- maining two patients with TGA, EEG was recorded by three electrodes placed on the scalp at Fz, Cz and Pz in order to finish the ERP recording during the episode. In this report, data recorded at selected electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz) are shown for all seven patients. The electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded from an electrode placed below the right outer canthus. Electrode impedance was kept less than 5000 . All electrodes for EEG and EOG were referred to linked earlobe electrodes except for the first recording in Patient 5, in which the balanced sternoverte- bral noncephalic electrodes were used as a reference (Stephenson and Gibbs, 1951) . The EEG and EOG signals were amplified 30, 000 times with the filter setting of 0. 05-60 Hz ( 3 dB) , and digitized with the sampling rate of 500 Hz. After excluding trials containing high-ampli- tude potentials due to eye movements or other artifacts, all segments of EEG and EOG in response to two different kinds of stimuli were averaged separately with respect to the stimulus onset over a time base of 1024 ms including 104 ms of the prestimulus period. The mean amplitude of the prestimulus period was used as the zero baseline for measuring the amplitude of identified peaks. For evaluating the presence or absence of P300 in each ERP wave form, a clear positive peak with the latency between 300 and 600 ms after the stimulus onset and with the maximal amplitude at Pz which appeared in the re- sponses to target stimuli, but not in those to non-target stimuli, was judged as P300. The potential peaks preceding the P300 were named NI, P2 and N2 according to the terminology previously adopted by some of the present authors (Barrett et al. , 1987) . In those patients who showed a positive peak fulfilling the above criteria, the latency of P300 was evaluated by using the formula of the linear regression against the subject s age, which was obtained in our previous study in normal subjects (Barrett et al. , 1987) . The lateney within the 95% confidence limits correspond- ing to each patient s age was judged as normal. Since the present recording condition was not exactly identical to the M.

Responses to non-target (fre- quent) stimuli are shown on the left and those to target (rare) stimuli on the right. Upward deflection indicates relative negativity in grid 1 in this and all other figures. The 104 ms epoch before the stimulus serves as the zero baseline for the amplitude measurement. The number of averaged responses is 20 for target stimuli and about 80 for non-target stimuli. A P300 wave form (arrow) is well recognized in the responses to target stimuli both during the episode and on the follow-up study. The latency and amplitude measured at Pz electrode is 376 ms and 14. 7 , V, respec- tively, during the episode, and 356 ms and 13. 3 pV, respectively, on the follow-up study. previous one (Barrett et al. , 1987) , judgment as to the peak latency was made with great caution. The amplitude of P300 peak was measured from the baseline described above. 4. Results All subjects performed the response tasks correctly in all recording sessions, which were confirmed by the moni- toring method as described in Section 3. In Patients 1-3, none of whom had any visible struc- tural lesions on CT or MRI, ERPs were clearly recogniz- able and reproducible (Figs. 2-4) . In Patients 1 and 2 with TGA, components N2 and P300 were detected in the responses to target stimuli on recordings both during and after the amnestic episode (Figs. 2 and 3) . The latency and amplitude were within normal limits on both occasions in each patient. In Patient 1, the latency of P300 was 376 ms during the episode and 356 ms after the episode, although in the ERP obtained after the episode, the slow negative wave appeared to have replaced P300 at the fronto-central area (Fz and Cz) (Fig. 2) .

A P300 wave form (arrow) is well recognized in the responses to target stimuli both during the episode and on the follow-up study. The latency and amplitude measured at Pz electrode is 350 ms and 11. 3 pV, respectively, during the episode and 392 ms and 11. 4 V, respectively, on the follow-up study. P300 with the latency of 350 ms was seen during the episode. Although the record was contaminated with an eye movement artifact after 500 ms after the stimulus presentation, P300 was recognized independently of the artifact. After the episode, the latency of P300 was slightly prolonged (392 ms) , although its wave form was similar to that seen during the episode (Fig. 3) . In Patient 3 with amnesia following viral encephalitis, a well recognizable and reproducible P300 at a latency of 340 ms was recorded both on the initial study (Fig. 4) and on the follow-up.

In the initial record, NI and P2 are detectable both in the responses to target and non-target stimuli, but P300 is totaly absent. On the follow-up study. a slow negative potential (arrow) with relatively high amplitude is seen at the peak latency of 456 ms only in responses to target stimuli. negative potential with long duration was seen only in the responses to target stimuli (Fig. 5) . The initial record of Patient 5 who had amnesia following herpes simplex en- cephalitis showed no positive peak at all corresponding to P300 (Fig. 6, top) . Instead a slow negative potential was observed maximally at Cz (472 ms, 13. 2 pV) . On the follow-up study performed 9 months after disease onset (Fig. 6, bottom) , a small positive peak with the latency of 350 ms appeared only in the responses to non-target stimuli. In the responses to target stimuli, the slow nega- tive potential became smaller, and instead a positive peak appeared with the significantly prolonged latency (620 ms at Pz) . The wave form was totally different from the positive peak which was observed in the responses to non-target stimuli. In the initial record of Patient 6 with amnesia following anoxic encephalopathy (Fig. 7, top) only N1 and P2 were detectable in the responses to both target and non-target stimuli. N2 and P300 were not recognized. The follow-up record obtained 6 months later showed a small positivity both in the target and non-target responses (Fig. 7, bottom) . Only in the responses to target stimuli, the positive peak was followed by a slow negative potential with relatively high amplitude. The latency of that positivity was 268 ms, and its amplitude was 8. 6 pV.

Its latency was 322 ms at Pz, which was within the normal range. 5. Discussion In the present study, we recorded auditory ERP in seven amnestic patients due to various etiologies and having variable clinical pictures and different extension of brain lesions. Moreover, the interval between the onset of dis- ease and time of ERP recording was also different among patients. However, all of the patients were commonly characterized, at least at the time of ERP recording, by severe anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia of various degrees without any other obvious cognitive disor- ders. As the result of the ERP recording by using the auditory oddball paradigm, we could not find any consis- tent relation between the degree of memory impairment and P300 in terms of its existence, amplitude, latency or wave form. For example, in Patients | and 2 with TGA, P300 could be recorded even during the amnestic episode. This result is compatible with the previous reports by Meador et al. (1988) and by Bokura et al. (1994) both of whom found normal auditory P300 during the amnestic episode in each patient with TGA. No detectable lesion on CT (Meador et al. , 1988) or only a small lesion in the left lateral medulla but no other abnormal findings on MRI (Bokura et al. , 1994) was reported. Furthermore, the P300 wave form did not significantly change in the present two patients even after they had recovered completely from the amnestic episode, supporting the normality of the P300 wave form obtained during the episode. The P300 compo- nent of ERPs has been thought to reflect cognitive process and especially memory updating or memory retrieval (Mc- Carthy and Donchin, 1981; Wickens, 1990; Verleger et al. , 1991) . However, the question as to which cognitive pro- cess is most critically involved in the oddball paradigm has still remained unsolved. Some authors suggested that the oddball paradigm involved only a little of the short-term memory function (Starr and Barrett, 1987) . The results of the present study also suggest that the P300 elicited by using the standard auditory oddball paradigm is indepen- dent of the degree of short-term memory impairment. One of the most remarkable findings in the present study was the difference in P300 between patients with and without detectable lesions in the mesial temporal lobes on CT or MRI. None showed any detectable lesions in the temporoparietal junction which may abolish the P3b (Knight et al. , 1989) . In patients without any detectable lesions on the imaging studies, the P300 wave form was well organized, whereas, in patients with detectable lesions in the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, P300 was either absent or extremely abnormal in its wave form even if present. Neither failure to record P300 nor the finding of abnormal P300 wave forms in the present series can be explained by technical failures because the wave forms were well reproducible on each test day in all patients (Figs. 2-8) and also because there was an improvement in the wave form in two patients in whom P300 was markedly abnormal in the initial studies (Figs. 6 and 7) . These data are different from the previous reports by Onofrj et al. (1991, Onofrj et al. , 1992a) and Polich and Squire (1993) both of whom reported persistent P300 in patients with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. Explanation of the discrep- ancy between these studics and our present study may be twofold. One reason is a possible involvement of brain structures other than the mesial temporal lobe which might have escaped detection by MRI in some patients of the present series. The etiology of the mesial temporal lesions in five patients reported by Onofrj et al. (1992a) and in two of our patients was encephalitis, and one of our patients and one reported by Polich and Squire (1993) had anoxic encephalopathy, both of which could have affected the brain diffusely rather than locally. Therefore, the possi- bility that only our patients had some lesions which were closely related to the generation of P300 and yet escaped detection by MRI cannot completely be excluded. In parti- culiar, Patient 6 had central pontine and extra-pontine myelinolysis before the anoxic episode, although the le- sions in pons and extra-pontine white matter had already improved markedly on MRI at the time of ERP recording. The second possibility is that only certain regions in the mesial temporal lobes might be closely related to the generation of P300, which could have been affected in some of our cases and spared in those reported by the previous authors (Onofrj et al. . 1991, 1992a; Polich and Squire, 1993) , probably due to the difference in extension and severity of the lesion. In Patient 6 in the present series, ERP wave form improved remarkably as the MRI lesions in the mesial temporal lobes reduced in size. It should be also added that the abnormality of P300 in Patients 4-6 in the present series was not just a decrement of amplitude or prolongation of latency, but it was a complete disappear- ance of the positive component which was even replaced by a negative potential in Patients 4 and 5. In addition to this, Patient 3 in the present series had no MRI lesion and 104 M. Honda et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 139 (1996) 95-105 showed entirely normal P300 in spite of the history of encephalitis. These findings medial septal lesions resulted in decline or disappearance of P300 component, but partial destruction of bilateral hippocampi was fol- lowed by persistence of P300 (Harrison et al. , 1988; Buchwald, 1990) . Harrison et al. (1988) also reported that in septum-lesioned cats acetylcholinesterase was markedly decreased in the hippocampus and that the septohippocam- pal system was essentially involved in the modulation and/or generation of P300. These findings may suggest a more important role of the neural network including mesial temporal lobe rather than the mesial temporal lobe itself in generating P300. Findings reported in the present study suggest the possi- ble relationship of scalp-recorded P300 to the mesial tem- poral lobe at least in some cases, but they do not necessar- ily indicate that the potential generated in the mesial temporal lobes forms by itself a component of the scalp-re- corded P300. Taken together with experimental results, it is most likely that some neural networks including certain parts of mesial temporal area, although still unclear, play an important role in generation or modulation of P300, and hence it is postulated that lesions seated in the mesial temporal lobe might affect the scalp-recorded P300 secon- darily rather than directly. In Patient 7 in the present series who suffered from Korsakoff syndrome, P300 of long duration and low ampli- tude was recognizable in spite of the fact that she had surgical intervention which could have caused a partial involvement of the septohippocampal system and resulted in the abnormal wave form of P300. This finding is compatible with the previous study in which St. Clair et al. (1985) reported a normal P3 in patients with alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. In summary, we recorded P300 elicited by the standard auditory oddball paradigm in seven patients with selective impairment of memory functions. Three patients without any detectable lesions on MRI, including two patients studied during the episode of TGA, showed a well-defined P300 wave form. In contrast, three patients with detectable MRI lesions in the mesial temporal lobes did not show any detectable wave form corresponding to P300. Furthermore, in one patient out of these three, the ERP wave form showed significant change in accordance with the improve- ment of MRI findings. One patient with hypothalamic lesion had low amplitude P300. On the other hand, al- though neuropsychological examinations showed selective and severe impairment of memory function in all the patients, no significant relationship was found between the degree of memory disturbance and P300 abnormality. It is concluded from these findings that P300 is more affected by existence and extension of detectable brain lesions, especially in the mesial temporal lobes, rather than the degree of memory disturbance itself.

        "other": "remains controversial. Some investigators recorded normal scalp P300 in amnestic patients (Meador et al. , 1988; Onofrj et al. , 1991, 1992a; Polich and Squire, 1993) , and Starr and Barrett (1987) claimed that the oddball paradigm depends only a little on memory function and that other paradigms might provide a more useful analytic method in the assessment of memory disturbance. Although a large number of studies have been made on the neural generator (s) of the scalp-recorded P300, the question as to its generator source has not completely been solved. The mesial temporal lobe has drawn a particular attention as a candidate for the main P300 generators. By the intracranial ERP recording in epileptic patients, several authors demonstrated the P300-like potential which showed 96 M. Honda et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 139 (1996) 95-105 phase reversal within or near the mesial temporal lobe (Halgren et al. , 1980; Altafullah et al. , 1986; Smith et al. , 1986, 1990; Stapleton and Halgren, 1987; McCarthy and Wood, 1987; Meador et al. , 1987; Puce et al. , 1989ab; Kropotov and Etlinger, 1991; Paller et al. , 1992) . How- ever, they found that the peak latency and/or the morphol- ogy of P300 generated in the mesial temporal lobes were different from those of P300 recorded from scalp elec- trodes, These findings suggested that the mesial temporal lobe generated only a part of the scalp P300. On the other hand, some authors suggested complex multiple generators in and suggest the possibility that the generation of scalp-recorded P300 is affected by existence and extension of organic lesions in the mesial temporal lobes. The relationship of the scalp-recorded P300 to mesial temporal lobe structure is controversial and uncertain. Intracranial recording during the auditory oddball paradigm in epileptic patients revealed some potentials in the mesial temporal area concomitant with the scalp-recorded P300 (Halgren et al. , 1980; Altafullah et al. , 1986; Smith et al. , 1986, 1990; McCarthy and Wood, 1987; Meador et al. , 1987; Stapleton and Halgren, 1987; Puce et al. , 1989a, b; Kropotoy and Etlinger, 1991; Paller et al. , 1992) . Some authors, however, believe that P300 potentials generated in the mesial temporal lobe might not be a major contribution to the scalp-recorded P300 (Halgren et al. , 1986; Smith et al. , 1990; Kropotov and Etlinger, 1991) . Using magnetoencephalography, there have been some attempts to identify the source location of the extracere- brally recorded P300. Its source has been reported either in the mesial temporal lobe (Okada et al. , 1983; Lewine et al. , 1989) , in the superficial temporal cortex (Gordon et al. , 1987) or in the auditory association cortex and thalamus (Rogers et al. , 1991) . It would be critical that all of them applied single dipole model for the source of P300, al- though the intracerebral recordings have clearly suggested the existence of the multiple sources (Halgren et al. , 1995) .

Investigations, including a lumbar puncture, electroencephalogram (EEG) and serology testing ruled out infectious, neoplastic and epilleptogenic causes. MRI taken 10 days after symptom onset, was suggestive of sequential ischemic damage to both hippocampal formations. Neuropyschological evaluation suggested a focal and dense amnestic syndrome with little improvement over time. The bilateral nature of hippocampal ischemia though has been reported, is rare. Key words: amnesia, memory, MRI, stroke. Case report The patient is a 54-year-old gentleman, non-smoker, with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea and depression. His diabetes was diagnosed in 1997 on routine testing, when he was started on glypizide 5 mg bid later increased to 10 mg bid. Metformin 1 g bid was added in 2003 whilst lantus 20 units ghs was started in 2004 due to HbA; , readings around 8%. Repeated ophthalmic exams over the years were normal and he had no history of peripheral vascular disease. He was non-adherent with the use of his CPAP machine. His family history showed that his father suffered from multiple sclerosis and type 2 diabetes, whilst his mother was treated for breast and uterine cancer before dying at the age of 70 from a heart attack. He has 3 siblings with no history for vascular risk factors. He presented to the emergency room with abrupt onset of short term memory loss of twenty-four hour duration. His neurologic exam, physical exam and a CT exam of his head were reported as being normal. Two days later, he presented to his primary care physician with persistant symptoms. He had difficulty finding his way to work, needed reminders by his wife to perform routine daily activities such as eating, taking his medications and he would ask his wife the same question repeatedly. He was unable to remember any recent events or anything up to a week before the onset of symptoms but was able to recall older events. Physical exam in the primary care physician s clinic was normal including his blood pressure. An MRI was performed 10 days after symptom onset.

Vocabulary and fund of knowledge were in the superior range. Expressive and receptive language functions were normal. Visuospatial and visuo- constructive abilities were average/above average. He had difficulties on tests requiring complex concentration and response inhibition but otherwise attention and executive functions were intact on exam. He endorsed a significant degree of emo- tional and psychological distress on a self-report inventory. Memory exam showed low average/average immediate memory span. Immediate story recall Table |. Neuropsychological test results* was also average, but he recalled none of this information after a delay. He had a constricted learning curve on word list (impaired) and he recalled none of the words after a brief or longer delays. A recognition format did not enhance his performance (impaired) . Immediate recall o geometric figures was in the average range but he recalled none of this information after a delay. In summary, our patient s neuropsychologica profile was suggestive of a focal and dense antegrade amnestic syndrome. Preventive risk factor control including adherence to CPAP, glucose and BP control were emphasized while he was continued on his daily 81 mg aspirin.

Repeat neuropsychological evaluation was done at 6 and 12 months (Table |) . Memory evaluation again showed low average/average intermediate memory span and average immediate story recal e e but severely impaired delayed recall. Immedia recall of word pairs was low average with som decay over a delay. A recognition format improved performance. Wordlist learning remained severely impaired and a supportive recognition format was not of benefit. Visual memory of geometric figures was in the broad average range on immediate recall, but with significant decay with delay. Recognition was low average to impaired. Reco- gnition was average for unfamiliar faces. Discussion The most likely etiology for our patient s presentation is a combination of factors. We hypothesise that the combination of small vessel disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension, together with hypoxia secondary to untreated sleep apnea might have been the cause of the patient s ischemic events. Since non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) causes between 20-25% of all strokes [5], even though our patient was not known to have AF, the patient had a 30-day event monitor to increase the chance of picking up paroxysmal AF, with negative results. The fact that the MRI was done 10 days after onset of symptoms would explain why the DWI sequence still showed restricted diffusion but ADC mapping did not show corresponding changes. DWI is sensitive to the self-diffusion of water protons. In ischemia there is water shift between he extracellular and intracellular space. Due to he decreased extracellular water, diffusion is restriced in the extracellular space, resulting in increased signal in DWI whereas the ADC, which is a quantative measure of water diffusion, decreases 6]. ADC normalisation is variable but usually occurs within 10 days of the onset of the ischemic insult 7]. In view of the fact that numerous etiologies can give restricted diffusion on DWI with a normal ADC 8], the patient had an extensive workup for other possible causes. MRA was normal and did not reveal vasospasm making vasospasm-related pathologies, ike reversible cerebral vasocontriction syndrome ess likely. Small vessel vasculitis usually presents with headaches, multiple lesions and a progressive course which does not fit the presentation of our patient. Though the history of a paraneoplastic syndrome is usually progressive, a paraneoplastic panel including checking for potassium channel antibodies was sent and was negative arguing against a limbic encephalitis. The fact that symptoms persisted, together with the MRI fin- dings, rule out transient global amnesia while the absence of migraine history is against a migraine type pathology. The normal EEG done with the patient still exhibiting anterograde amnesia rules out an epileptiform disorder. Hence the most likely cause in this case remains bilateral sequential small vessel ischemia of the hippocampal regions. As such, no specific interventions such as steroids or intavenous immunoglobulin was tried since no specicific treatment has been shown effective in similar cases. Patient was continued on his antiplatelet medication with stricter control of his diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. The bilateral nature of the ischemic events though previously reported is rare [9-11]. The arterial supply of the hippocampus mainly arises from the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) with a minor contribution from the anterior choroidal artery (AchA) [12]. However, many anatomical variations exist. The anterior, middle and posterior hippo- campal arteries arise from the P2 segment of the PCA supplying the occipital two-thirds of the hippocampus. The rostral one third is supplied by branches from the AchA. In our patient, the imaging studies suggest a right hippocampal ischemic event occurring first followed by involvement of the left hippocampal formation. A possible explanation for the bilateral nature of the ischemia would be a single artery branching into two to supply both hippocampi much like the artery of Percheron supplies both thalami [13]. Also, a unique feature in this case was that ischemia was limited to the hippocampi and parahippocampal gyri with no other posterior circulation territory was affected. With regards to the neuropsychological evalu- ation, the patient showed a dense predominantly antegrade amnesic syndrome which has largely persisted over time. Though there seems to be a consensus that premorbid semantic memory is usually spared with hippocampal lesions, it is no so clear when it comes to what degree episodic memory is affected. In this case, retrograde episodic memory up to a week prior to the onset o symptoms was affected. Why older memories seem to be less affected than recent ones, gave rise to different schools of thought mainly to the standard model of consolidation (SMC) and the multiple trace theory (MTT) . According to the SMC, the hippo- campus is only involved in consolidating explici memories [14]. Once consolidated in the neocortex, these memories can be retrieved independently o' the hippocampus. The MTT on the other hand states that besides being important in encoding declarative memories, the hippocampal formation is also actively involved in retrieval of these memories [15]. Our patient would tend to favor the SMC theory more than the MTT theory. Arch Med Sci 1, February / 2011 171 David Cachia, Joan Swearer, Warren Ferguson, Majaz Moonis In conclusion, though stroke is unfortunately a common occurrence in neurological clinical practice, bilateral hippocampal involvement with the resultant debilitating anterograde amnesia is a rare and unique manifestation.

Introduction Cerebral infarction can cause various neurological deficits such as muscle weakness, sensory impairment, and consciousness dis- turbance; however, it is rare for amnesia to be the only symptom of cerebral infarction. Memory deficit occurs when the medial tem- poral lobe, basal forebrain, and retrosplenial region are damaged [1]. Infarctions in other subcortical structures, such as the inter- nal capsule and medial thalamus, have also been reported to cause amnesia [2-4]. The fornix is another critical structure for memory. Several cases of fornix infarction resulting in memory loss have been previously reported. However, fornix lesions in such cases are associated with infarctions in other regions such as the cingulate cortex and corpus callosum [5-10]. Herein, we described an infor- mative case of amnesia, without any focal neurological deficits, that resulted from a single small unilateral infarction involving the ante- rior fornix, which was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . 2.

He was alert and well-oriented, and neither muscle weakness nor sensory impairment were observed. Apha- sia, unilateral neglect and hemiasomatognosia were not present. However, he did not recall events, such as what he ate and whom he met a few hours before, although he was able to correctly repeat words he heard. Short-term memory within a period of a few minutes was spared, while he forgot them about 5min later. In addition to the anterograde amnesia, the patient s mem- ory of events occurring several months before was lost. He could recall where his daughter s bridal reception was held, while he did not remember when it was. The bridal reception was 7 years before. He could not indicate the latest time point he could recall events. The patient s arterial blood pressure was relatively low (84/60 mmHg) , however, he was not dizzy or faint. ECG and echocardiogram showed no abnormal findings. The blood glucose level was 107 mg/dl. A diffusion-weighted MR image at 4 days after onset showed a small hyperintense lesion in the vicinity of the left Monro s foramen, which involved the anterior column of the fornix. T2-weighted image and FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recov- ery) images also revealed a hyperintense area in the same region (Fig. 1) . Other infarctions and brain atrophy were not present. Mag- netic resonance angiography revealed no abnormal findings. His score on the Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised, a popular Japanese neuropsychological test which well correlates with Mini- Mental State Examination [11] was 27 points (maximum score and normal lower limit are 30 and 21 points, respectively) . The scores of the Miyake Paired Verbal Association Learning Test, a Japanese test reflecting verbal recent memory, were poor (paired 3-4-7, non- K.

The primary deficit was in delayed recall; the attention and concentration index was close to normal. Among all subtests, the scores of Logical Memory | and II, Visual Recall II, Verbal Paired Associates | and II were particularly low. The patient was treated with an anti-platelet drug and edar- avone. Three months later, his anterograde and retrograde amnesia had improved slightly and he returned to his previous employ- ment as a plasterer. He retained plastering skill, and could recall some events of the previous day. However, he always needed to make notes in daily life and work because of persistent amnesia. WAIS-R and WMS-R showed no significant improvements. Verbal 1Q, performance IQ and full-scale IQ were 76, 76 and 74, respec- tively. WMS-R revealed that verbal memory index, visual memory index, general memory index, attention and concentration index, and delayed recall index were 73, 79, 71, 93, and 60, respectively. An MR Image 4 months after onset showed a small cavity due to the infarction in the left fornix (Fig. 1) . 3. Discussion The fornix is a fiber bundle containing efferent fibers that run from the hippocampus to the mammillary body. With the cingu- lated gyrus and anterior thalamus, these structures form the circuit of Papez which is crucial for mnemonic function [3, 12, 13]. Because of this anatomical arrangement, an injury to the fornix can cause memory impairment. Infarction of the fornix, as is the case with other cortical and subcortical structures, may result in memory impairment without motor or sensory deficits. It is possible that patients with cerebral infarctions manifesting amnesia without focal neurological deficits are misdiagnosed as dementia, such as Alzheimer s disease, particularly in elderly patients. Initially, the present patient and his family did not believe that his symptoms were due to stroke, because they felt he was not old enough to suffer one. In addition, although he was a smoker, he did not have hypertension, diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. In the neurolog- ical diagnosis of acute-onset of amnesia it is important to consider the possibility of cerebrovascular disease. In previous case reports of cerebral infarctions that involved the fornix also other regions were affected, including the cingu- late gyrus and corpus callosum. Although memory disturbance was attributed to damage of the fornix in these reports, additional effects due to other lesions could not be ruled out. Furthermore, 166 K.

Therefore, it is difficult to assess neurological symptoms that are purely the result of damage to the fornix. Clinical examples of dam- age restricted to the fornix are needed to elucidate this issue. The present patient had a small restricted lesion on the anterior column of the left fornix. This lesion was sufficient to cause anterograde and retrograde amnesia that persisted for more than 3 months. This illuminating case indicates that the fornix is a vulnerable and strategic structure whose destruction causes persistent memory impairment. Only the left side fornix was damaged in the present case. No lateralized cognitive dysfunctions, such as unilateral neglect, were present. Little is known about laterality of the fornix lesion. It has been reported that, unlike other structures in the brain, damages to both sides of the fornix similarly cause memory disturbance [14]. Previous reports have mentioned that memory loss was a typ- ical symptom of the fornix infarction [5-10]. IQs of these patients were spared in some cases [5, 8, 9], while others described additional cognitive impairments such as attention deficit and low-scored Mini-Mental State Examination [6, 10]. It is not known why these differences exist. In addition to memory disturbance, present case also showed low IQ scores. It is possible that the fornix dysfunc- tion affected performance on intelligence tests as well as memory. Another possibility is that the patient s intellectual ability was already poor before onset of the disease. It is impossible to confirm this possibility, because he had never experienced neuropsycho- logical examinations before onset of the disease. The patient had worked as a plasterer, which did not necessarily require high intel- lectual abilities, after graduation from Junior High School. This was a reason why he could return to his previous occupation in spite of memory problems, although this fact does not mean the patient's IQs were poor prior to the disease. The patient never experienced difficulties in social activities, and the amnesia which appeared suddenly, was noticed by the patient and his family as a strange symptom which had never existed before. Furthermore, MRI con- firmed a fornix infarction with signal intensity compatible with time course of the symptoms. These facts strongly suggest that the fornix infarction, and not any other disease or pre-existing condi- tions, caused long-lasting amnesia in this case.

Within a few months from the onset, the lesion gradually shrank and was finally confined to the left thalamus only, in particular to the antero-medial portion and the pulvinar. The mammillary bodies and the cortical areas of both hemispheres were spared. After the regression of a series of generalized cognitive deficits implying slow psychic activity, confusion, and spatial and temporal disorien- tation, the patient presented a persistent amnesic syndrome with mild language dis- orders, both in Italian and in English. Major disorders of memory included a dissoci- ation between verbal memory, which was severely impaired, and spatial memory, which was largely preserved. 1997 Academic Press INTRODUCTION Several different thalamic pathologies, such as chronic alcoholism, tu- mors, vascular disorders, and stereotaxic neurosurgical operations, may cause amnesia. Since lesions due to neoplastic formations or alcohol abuse are rarely confined to the thalamus only, most cases of pure thalamic amnesia We thank D.

THALAMIC AMNESIA 279 are the consequence of vascular disorders (Schott, Maugui re, Laurent, Ser- clerat, & Fischer, 1980) . In particular, thalamic hemorrhages are relatively frequent, accounting for 10% of all intracerebral hemorrhages (Choi, Sudar- sky, Schachter, Biber, & Burke, 1983; Kawahara, Sato, Muraki, Tanaka, Kaneko, & Uemura, 1986) . Since patients who have suffered from this pa- thology very often present with amnesia, thalamic hemorrhage represents the major cause for thalamic amnesia. On the other hand, ischemic infarc- tions offer the best conditions for studying thalamic amnesic syndromes, since pressure effects, such as compression of other adjacent structures, are limited (Graff-Radford, Eslinger, Damasio, & Yamada, 1984; von Cramon, Hebel, & Schuri, 1985) . Thus, many cases of thalamic amnesia due to arte- rial infarction are reported in the literature, but, to our knowledge, no tha- lamic amnesia following venous infarction has been described yet. However, thalamic amnesia is still a puzzling problem. The frequent co-occurrence of cognitive deficits, other than amnesic ones, often makes it difficult to distin- guish thalamic amnesia from thalamic dementia. Moreover, it is still rather unclear whether thalamic amnesia should be considered an independent form of the thalamic syndrome (Graff-Radford, Tranel, Van Hoesen, & Brandt, 1990) and whether retrograde amnesia is a constant symptom of thalamic amnesia (Butters & Stuss, 1989; Parkin, Rees, Hunkin, & Rose, 1994) . Fi- nally, the type and nature of the functional asymmetries of the thalamic nu- clei still must be defined (see Parkin & Leng, 1993, for a review) . A description of a case of venous infarction provoking a bilateral thalamic lesion will follow. After a few months from the onset of the infarction, the ischemic area shrank dramatically and the patient s initial cognitive impair- ments cleared up, while an amnesic syndrome characterized by severe an- terograde verbal amnesia and a slight, transient, retrograde amnesia became evident. CASE REPORT D. B. , born in 1951, is a right-handed Italian English bilingual engineer who lived in Australia from age 3 to 13 with his Italian family. There he went to an English school and was immersed in an English-speaking environment, whereas he spoke Italian within his family. After returning to Italy, he contin- ued to learn and use English at least once a week. Prior to the vascular disorder that brought him to our attention, D. B. was always healthy; he had never smoked, drunk, or made use of other toxic substances. No other risk factors were present in his anamnesis. At the beginning of September 1992, his relatives noticed that his mood had substantially changed: having been gregarious and outgoing before, he became apathetic and introverted; in addi- tion, he started to have some difficulty in remembering recent events. On September 10th, while he was on business in a town not far away from his home, he suddenly became confused and disoriented as to time and space, 280 PERU AND FABBRO and he was admitted to the Neurological Department of the Hospital in Mon- tebelluna, Treviso. During hospitalization, the patient manifested hypersom- nia, disorientation as to time and space, mental slowness, and loss of memory for autobiographical events. In addition, he was hardly aware of these impair- ments. Spontaneous speech prosody was monotonous and with low pitch, verbal production was apparently fluent, and no confabulation was observed. The patient s neurological signs were rather mild, consisting in a deficit of the seventh right cranial nerve and a moderate hyperreflexia of the right upper and lower limbs. EEG showed generalized slowing of electrical activ- ity, prevailingly on the left. A CT scan revealed a bilateral asymmetric lesion to the thalamus. MRI after 7 days postonset evinced an ischemic area involv- ing the antero-medial portions of the right thalamus and the whole left thala- mus, while the mammillary bodies and the cortex of both cerebral hemi- spheres were undamaged (Figs. la and 1b) . An angiogram manifested the presence of an arteriovenous fistula between a choroidal branch of the carotid system and the deep venous system. An excessive blood supply in the deep venous system, thus, had provoked an ischemic infarction of the surrounding tissue. By October 6th, when D. B. was delivered to the Neurosurgical De- partment at the General Hospital of Verona, hypersomnia and disorientation had regressed, whereas psychomotor activity was still slow and evident an- terograde and retrograde amnesic deficits persisted. The patient underwent a surgical embolization of the fistula, which was successful up to 90%, thus dramatically improving cerebral blood flow. Two weeks later he was dis- charged from the hospital: memory deficits persisted, while neurological dis- orders had disappeared. Soon after, mental slowness, confusion, and tempo- ral and spatial disorientation also significantly regressed, allowing the patient to resume his working activity. At 3 months postonset, the patient s ability to engage in the activities of daily life (ADL) by resuming social relations ranked at level 1 of the ADL scale (see Kawahara et al. , 1986) . In March, 1993, D. B. underwent another surgical embolization leading to the complete occlusion of the fistula. Follow-up MRI (Figs. 2a and 2b) performed 2 months later revealed considerable restriction of the ischemic area: it had practically disappeared on the right side and only affected the left antero- medial region, in particular the anterior nucleus, the dorso-medial nucleus of the thalamus (DMNT) , and the left pulvinar. Retrograde amnesia gradually disappeared and within 10 months memory for events preceding the disease was nearly normal. On the other hand, anterograde amnesia partly improved, but persists after more than 2 years from the onset of the pathology. PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENT Psychometric assessments were performed at the Institute of Human Phys- iology at the University of Verona.

If not otherwise specified, we refer to Spinnler and Tognoni (1987) for testing procedures and scoring. Scores below 1 SD of the control average are considered pathological indexes. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION Even in the acute phase the patient s temporal and spatial orientation were not impaired. Attention, perception, and praxias were well preserved. Spon- taneous speech in Italian was fluent, but dysprosodic and with low pitch. At times D. B. produced semantic paraphasias (e. g. , Examiner: * How many weeks has a year? Patient: Twelve and thirteen a leap year ) and was also slightly anomic. In this phase he showed the following major cognitive symptoms (see Table 1) : Intelligence D. B. s verbal IQ according to the WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981) scale was low, mainly because of his poor arithmetic performance (see be- low) . On the Raven Progressive Matrices (1938) he scored within 1 SD from comparison mean; however, this score must be considered below normal given the patient s high level of education. Frontal lobe functions. On the Verbal Fluency Test, a reliable measure of frontal lobe efficiency (Speedie & Heilman, 1983) , D. B. scored very poorly and displayed also a tendency to verbal perseverations. 284 PERU AND FABBRO Arithmetic abilities. D. B. had no difficulties in performing the very easy mental calculation subtest of the Arithmetic Judgement Test, but he made 9 errors out of 14 trials on the WAIS-R arithmetic subtest, mainly because he needed too much time to answer the items. However, he was not able to make a progressive subtraction of 3 digits starting from 20. This test is con- sidered an index of the correct functioning of the frontal lobes, rather than a simple arithmetic task. After 5 months from the onset of the illness, D. B. showed a dramatic improvement of his intellectual abilities, which was verified by means of the WAIS-R (2 errors out of 14 trials on the arithmetic subtest) and the Raven Progressive Matrices. On the Verbal Fluency Test he performed within 1 SD interval from comparison mean, but, again, this was rather poor given the patient s high educational level. In this phase DB. still presented with semantic paraphasias (e. g. , Examiner: What is a synagogue? Patient: It is the church of the Arabic ) . He was administered the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) according to Paradis (1987) , which showed fluent spontaneous speech both in Italian and in English with some phonemic and semantic paraphasias and mild disorders of comprehension, writing, and reading in both languages. The most severe disorders mainly affected lexical access of both languages (see also Fabbro, Peru, & Skrap, 1995) . In the course of the third assessment (9 months postonset) , a thorough analysis of the patient s arithmetic disorders was done by means of the Acal- culia Test (Miceli & Capasso, 1987) . The knowledge of arithmetic rules and the numbering system turned out to be well preserved. D. B. performed flawlessly when reading or repeating numbers with less than 6 digits; in contrast, when presented with numbers of 6 digits, D. B. made 3 errors out of 5 trials in both the repetition (e. g. , 527506 instead of 527106) and the reading tasks (e. g. , the number 328762 was split as 328 and 362) . D. B. made 5 errors out of 60 trials (8. 33%) in the written calculation subtest; he also made 12 errors out of 55 trials (21. 8%) in the mental calculation subtest requiring a greater involvement of memory.

In both tests D. B. scored normally. Long-Term Memory (a) Procedural Memory The Maze Learning Test, following De Renzi, Faglioni, and Villa (1977) , was used. The number of trials made by D. B. to reach the goal was within the normal range. (b) Spatial Memory The Corsi s Block Tapping Test, which implies the learning of a supraspan sequence to be reproduced twice in a row without making mistakes, was used. In the acute phase D. B. was unable to meet requirements, whereas in the remaining three assessments he always scored normal. (c) Visuo-Spatial Memory DB. had no problems in reproducing the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure after a delay. In the Picture Display Test D. B. behaved as follows: For 5 min we displayed, on a table in front of him, 30 pictures taken from children playing bingo; after the pictures were removed, he was asked to recall as many pictures as possible. He only recalled 15 of 30. After 15 min the same 30 pictures were presented mingled with another 30 new pictures: D. B. s task was to sort out the first 30 pictures he had been shown. Although he had performed very poorly in free recall, he turned out to be perfectly able to recognize the pictures and sort the old from the new ones (29 of 30) . Similar results have been observed also in the Rey Memory Test, which is quite reliable for the purpose of discriminating between pretenders and pa- tients with genuine memory disorders (Rey, 1964) . In this test D. B. clearly showed a dissociation between visual memory, which was still well pre- served, and verbal memory, which turned out to be rather impaired. (d) Verbal Memory Recall of stories. The examiner read a short story and required the patient to recall it immediately (IR, immediate recall) . The story was then repeated and, after a 10-min break, an unexpected delayed recall was required (DR, delayed recall) . Correctly recalled story items in IR and DR were counted separately. D. B. s performance in the acute phase was very poor, whereas he showed a slight improvement 5 months postonset and improved up to a normal level 9 months postonset. In all assessments, however, IR was worse than DR. THALAMIC AMNESIA 287 Serial position curve. This test consists in the immediate free recall of 10 lists with 12 words each read out loud by the examiner at a pace of 1 word every 2 sec. In normals, the chance to recall a given word depends on its position within the list: words in the initial and final position have far better chances to be recalled than the others (primacy and recency effect, PE, and RE, respectively) . Thus, RE and PE scores are considered to be a reliable index of recall abilities from short-term and long-term memory, respectively (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966) . D. B. has always shown a high RE, whereas PE was below normal standards in the first three evaluation sessions. Only dur- ing the fourth evaluation session (24 months postonset) did his PE reach a normal level, but his RE had worsened, though it was still within normal values. Selective reminding test. The procedure suggested by Buschke and Fuld (1974) was slightly revised in this test. The patient did not meet requirements in 18 trials and in all trials recall from long-term memory was very poor. Word list. For 5 min the patient was allowed to read through a list of 30 words which he then was asked to recall. After a 15-min break, the patient was asked to detect these 30 words introduced at random within a longer list of 60 words. In the third evaluation session D. B. s recall was below standard, whereas it improved up to a normal level in the fourth session. Word recognition was below normal standards in both sessions. Remote Memory A slightly revised version of the MLT 88 test according to Andreani, Amoretti, and Baldi (1988) was used for the purpose of investigating D. B. s memory for events having occurred from his birth year to 1988. Two versions of this test were administered: one with verbal stimuli and the other with pictures. Each version included 22 questions, 2 for each lustrum. Each com- pletely correct answer scored 2 points; each partially correct answer scored 1 point. Five other subjects matching in age and education level acted as controls. In the acute phase, D. B. scored significantly lower than controls in both versions; then his retrograde memory deficit gradually improved to reach nearly normal level in the following evaluation sessions. Famous Personalities of the Present Further data on D. B s memory for events of the recent past have been obtained by means of this test, which includes questions on 10 famous people from the past 20 years. In this test the patient also had severe memory prob- lems in the acute phase, but he gradually returned to normal in the chronic phase. 288 PERU AND FABBRO Semantic Knowledge In the WAIS subtests referring to information, analogies, sentences, and vocabulary, D. B. showed severe deficits in the acute phase, which had sub- stantially improved as early as in the second evaluation session. The patient was also administered three other questionnaires with 10 items each concern- ing animals habits, the use of objects, and sentence completion. In the acute phase, D. B made a single mistake when naming the elephant as the king of the jungle, instead of the lion. In subsequent sessions he made no mistakes at all. A test of Famous Personalities of the Past with 10 questions on famous people from Italian history was also administered. D. B. performed very poorly in the acute phase and nearly reached normal standards in the chronic phase. As in the MLT 88 test, he made some semantic paraphasias by confus- ing Leonardo da Vinci with Michelangelo and Amerigo Vespucci with Chris- topher Columbus. DISCUSSION Immediately postonset, D. B. presented with disorders of awareness that were not accompanied by impairments of ocular motility, a rather frequent symptom observed in diencephalic lesions (Castaigne, Lhermitte, Buge, Es- courolle, Hauw, & Lyon-Caen, 1981; Antonini, Rasura, Paolini, Mercieri, Pantano, Gragnani, & Argentino, 1994) . This shows that the lesion only af- fected the nuclei of the median thalamic line (Guberman & Stuss, 1983; Gentilini, De Renzi, & Crisi, 1987) , thus sparing the thalamo-encephalic structures with oculomotor innervations. As soon as the patient s disorders of awareness improved, he showed a severe amnesia associated with a state of confusion, disorientation as to time and space, and mild language disor- ders. These additional cognitive impairments are a consistent feature of tha- lamic amnesia. In some cases, however, they are so severe that memory loss represents only one symptom of thalamic dementia (Guberman & Stuss, 1983; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984; Muller, Dest e, Steinling, Pruvo, & Warot, 1989) . Two main criteria may be used to disentangle amnesia from dementia: (1) Amnesic patients present permanent memory deficits even after the re- covery of other cognitive disorders. (2) Patients with pure amnesic syndrome usually perform within normal range on a digit span, while a bad perfor- mance on this task is frequently reported in patients with generalized mental deterioration (Parkin & Leng, 1993) . D. B. surely fulfilled these two criteria. Recovery of generalized cognitive disorders occurred relatively early, as early as in the second evaluation (5 months postonset) , and the patient s IQ ranked normal. However, disorders of long-term memory still persisted, while his performance on immediate memory tasks was always within nor- mal range. Finally, D. B. s picture is also consistent with the typical features of thalamic amnesia: a total recovery of anterograde deficits very seldom THALAMIC AMNESIA 289 occurs, but the persistence of a psychometric impairment does not prevent patients from returning to their previous activities (Signoret & Goldenberg, 1986) . D. B. can therefore be viewed as a case of pure thalamic amnesia. Thalamic Amnesia Provoked by Venous Infarction To our knowledge, this is the first description of a case of pure thalamic amnesia following a venous infarction. Angiographic investigations of our patient revealed that the venous infarction had been provoked by an arterio- venous fistula. This is a rare finding, since arteriovenous malformations gen- erally produce arterial hemorrhages. On the other hand, venous infarctions, which are mainly due to coagulation disorders or complications of heart dis- eases, are less frequent than arterial infarctions. The remarkable recovery of cognitive and mnestic functions in D. B. suggests that venous infarctions may have a better prognosis than arterial infarctions. Additional Cognitive Impairments In the chronic phase, the patient showed, in addition to mnestic disorders, two other major cognitive deficits affecting language and arithmetic calcula- tion, respectively. Language disorders have been relatively frequently ob- served in thalamic amnesia (Crosson, 1992) . Speech abnormalities have been described in connection with lesions of the left thalamus affecting both the paramedian territory (Meissner, Sapir, Kokmen, & Stein, 1987; Stuss, Gu- berman, Nelson, & La Rochelle, 1988; Ghidoni, Pattacini, Galimberti, & Aguzzoli, 1989) and the tuberothalamic territory (Bogousslavsky, Regli, & Uske, 1988) , and also the following thalamic nuclei: the antero-lateral thala- mus (Goldenberg, Wimmer, & Maly, 1983) , the DMNT and the MMT (Mori, Yamadori, & Mitani, 1986) , and the pulvinar (Castaigne et al. , 1981; Meis- sner et al. , 1987; Fensore, Lazzarino, Nappo, & Nicolai, 1988) . D. B. s lan- guage disorders were consistent with those described by Fensore et al. (1988) in thalamic aphasia : fluent speech with phonemic and semantic parapha- sias with unimpaired comprehension and repetition. D. B. turned out to be also mildly anomic, as also observed by Meissner et al. (1987) in their clini- cal data. As opposed to the relatively high frequency of language impair- ments, disorders of arithmetic calculation have been rarely observed in tha- lamic amnesia (McEntee, Biber, Perl, & Benson, 1976; Guberman & Stuss, 1983; Fensore et al. , 1988) . In the case of our patient, a thorough analysis of these symptoms revealed that both enumeration abilities and awareness of arithmetic calculation rules were undamaged. Thus, D. B. did not show a genuine acalculia, but failed in all the trials requiring the involvement of verbal memory beyond his actual possibilities. Functional Thalamic Asymmetry In the initial phase, the ischemic lesion affected both the left and the right thalamus; after a few months, however, it was confined to the left thalamus 290 PERU AND FABBRO only. D. B. s mnestic impairments selectively regarded verbal material. Dur- ing the acute phase, the patient was unable to learn a spatial supraspan se- quence, and this was probably due to an initial deterioration of frontal func- tions. This transient deficit of spatial memory cleared up, whereas disorders of verbal memory persisted chronically. Although some authors deny the existence of a functional specialization of the two thalami (von Cramon et al. , 1985; Rousseaux, Cabaret, Lesoin, Dubois, & Petiti, 1986) , data obtained from D. B. actually corroborate the hypothesis of a functional asymmetry of the left and right thalamus for verbal material (Squire & Moore, 1979; Mi- chel, Laurent, Foyater, Blanc, & Portafaix, 1982; Ojemann, 1982; Gol- denberg et al. , 1983; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984; Mori et al. , 1986; Parkin et al. , 1994) and nonverbal material, respectively (Guberman & Stuss, 1983; Speedie & Heilman, 1983; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984; Crosson, 1992) . Retrograde Deficits in Thalamic Amnesia It is still unclear whether retrograde amnesia is a constant symptom of thalamic amnesia (Butters & Stuss, 1989) , but as far as retrograde thalamic amnesia is concerned, this is always associated with a bilateral thalamic le- sion (McEntee et al. , 1976; Barbizet, Degos, Louarn, Nguyen, & Mas, 1981; Goldenberg et al. , 1983; Signoret & Goldenberg, 1986; Rousseaux et al. , 1986; Meissner et al. , 1987; Muller et al. , 1989; Graff-Radford et al. , 1990; Antonini et al. , 1994) , the only exception being a patient described by von Cramon et al. (1985) , and it tends to regress in the course of time (Winocur, Oxbury, Roberts, Agnetti, & Davis, 1984; Nichelli, Bahmanian-Behbahani, Gentilini, & Vecchi, 1988) . Unilateral lesions, however, do not provoke ret- rograde amnesia (Squire & Moore, 1979; Speedie & Heilman, 1983; patient no. 4 in von Cramon et al. , 1985; Mori et al. , 1986; Fensore et al. , 1988) ; only Graff-Radford and colleagues (1984) found persistent retrograde amne- sic deficits with unilateral thalamic lesions, though it should be pointed out that all their patients presented multiple lesion accompanied by generalized cognitive impairments. Our patient, D. B. , manifested transient deficits of remote memory, but after 10 months postonset he had already recovered memory for events that occurred before the ischemic lesion. Our data thus support the hypothesis according to which preserved unilateral thalamic functions may compensate for the retrograde deficit caused by contralateral lesions (Parkin et al. , 1994) . Anterograde Deficits: How Many Types of Thalamic Amnesia? Several cases of amnesia following focalized lesions in specific thalamic structures have been described in the literature (see Markowitsch, 1988, for a review) , and in particular lesions to the nucleus dorso-medialis (Schott et al. , 1980; Guberman & Stuss, 1983; Speedie & Heilman, 1982; Kawahara THALAMIC AMNESIA 291 et al. , 1986) , to the mammillo-thalamic tract (von Cramon et al. , 1985; Mori et al. , 1986; Gentilini et al. , 1987) , to the anterior nucleus (Graff- Radford et al. , 1990; Parkin et al. , 1994) , to the intralaminar nuclei (Gold- enberg et al. , 1983) , and to the lamina medullaris interna (von Cramon et al. , 1985; Calabrese, Haupts, Markowitsch, & Gehlen, 1993) . On the other hand, some authors argue that thalamic lesions alone are not sufficient to induce amnesia and that a combination of damage is required to produce severe memory impairments (Mishkin, 1982; Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983; Kritchevsky, Graff-Radford, & Damasio, 1987) . Thalamic amnesia may thus manifest itself following lesions to various thalamic structures; however, it is generally considered a unitary syndrome, irrespective of the site of the lesion. Some authors believe that thalamic amnesia resembles diencephalic amnesia (McEntee et al. , 1976; Winocur et al. , 1984; Swanson & Schmidley, 1985; Parkin et al. , 1994) , others assimilate it to hippocampal amnesia (Schott et al. , 1980; Goldenberg et al. , 1983) , and still others maintain that it should be viewed as an autonomous syndrome, differing from both dience- phalic and hippocampal amnesia (Barbizet et al. , 1981) . A few authors sug- gested that specific focalized lesions may determine specific patterns of am- nesia (Lhermitte & Signoret, 1972; Signoret & Goldenberg, 1986) , but the limited number of cases with localized lesions to definite thalamic structures described in the literature so far does not allow a specification of the role of each structure in amnesic syndromes (Aggleton, 1986) . DB. had a lesion to the left thalamus involving three nuclei: the DMNT, the anterior nucleus, and the pulvinar. Since the DMNT is interconnected with the frontal lobes, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, a lesion to this structure may explain the frontal deficits observed in several other patients (Lhermitte & Signoret, 1972; Speedie & Heilman, 1983) . In our patient, frontal deficits were quite evident in the acute phase, whereas in the chronic phase the only evidence of frontal deficits was the poor performance in the Verbal Fluency Test. The anterior nucleus is apparently involved in the pro- cess of consolidation of memory traces (Mishkin, 1978) and in working memory, and this would explain D. B. s deficits of recognition in the Word List Test, in the Selective Reminding Test, and in the recall of stories: in all these tests delayed recall was always better than immediate recall, thus suggesting possible impairments of the phonological loop within the working memory system (Baddeley, 1990) . Lesions to the anterior nucleus and the pulvinar may account for mild aphasic disorders (e. g. , anomias, semantic paraphasias, syntactic mistakes) that have been observed in D. B. s two languages (see also Crosson, 1992; Fabbro & Paradis, 1995) . The neuropsychological symptoms of this patient thus depend on a lesion to specific thalamic nuclei. This observation, how- ever, is in contrast with the hypothesis that thalamic amnesia is a unitary syndrome. In our opinion, neuropsychological deficits occurring after a tha- 292 PERU AND FABBRO lamic lesion may differ from patient to patient and may also depend on the nature, the site, and the extention of the lesion (Rousseaux et al. , 1986; Ghi- doni et al. , 1989) .

        "case_report": "Check for updates The Necessity of the Medial Temporal Lobe for Statistical Learning Anna C. Schapiro , Emma Gregory , Barbara Landau , Michael McCloskey , and Nicholas B. Turk-Browne Abstract lf The sensory input that we experience is highly patterned, and we are experts at detecting these regularities. Although the extraction of such regularities, or statistical learning (SL) , is typically viewed as a cortical process, recent studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) , including the hippocampus. These studies have employed fMRI, leaving open the possibility that the MTL is involved but not necessary for SL. Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control par- ticipants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of INTRODUCTION The same items often reliably co-occur in time or space across repeated experiences. The mind can identify such statistical relationships by aggregating across these experi- ences and extracting probabilistic information a process often referred to as statistical learning (SL) . For example, 2 min of exposure to a novel language is sufficient for 8-month-old infants to acquire knowledge of the words embedded therein, based purely on the temporal statistics of the sequence of syllables (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996) . This form of learning is also robust in adults and is observed for many modalities and types of stimuli (Baldwin, Andersson, Saffran, & Meyer, 2008; Conway & Christiansen, 2005; paMssapAapY Avog papeupApcCpepeoTuMod SLSED. E/ 81291 TZ0% KEW UZORUSMAMDSEPTTeIIPN TIO GUT POS ASOD CRW VHP AG ILS hippocampal function, as shown in paradigms like the transitive inference task (Dusek & Eichenbaum, 1997) . Unlike this task, however, the individual episodes being integrated in SL are not clearly defined they are embedded in a continuous sequence of stimuli and must be segmented. Still, the relational and integrative aspects of MTL function are well suited to SL. Although there are indications that the MTL is involved in SL, it remains unclear whether it is necessary. For instance, the fMRI activation seen during SL may be epi- phenomenal or a byproduct of more essential learning elsewhere in the brain. To obtain stronger evidence for the necessity of the MTL for SL, we report a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and some additional damage to surrounding MTL cortex and left anterior temporal lobe. Across three experiments, LSJ was passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities. In all stimulus classes and for both relatively complex and simpler regularities, LSJ exhibited no evi- dence of SL. This finding contrasts with results from groups of age- and education-matched control partici- pants, who showed reliable SL for all stimulus classes. LSJ was, however, able to remember the individual stimuli presented in the sequences, suggesting that her SL defi- cits did not result from general difficulties with task demands. These results provide converging support for the hypothesis that the MTL is necessary for the successful extraction of temporal regularities from the environment. CASE REPORT LSJ, a 62-year-old woman with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, was a highly successful illustrator and an accom- lished amateur violist. In 2007 at age 57, she contracted herpes encephalitis, resulting in bilateral destruction of the hippocampus, bilateral damage to other MTL regions, and left anterior temporal lobe damage (Figure 1A) . Consistent with her extensive MTL damage and the neuropsychological profile of other cases of herpes en- cephalitis (e. g. , Kapur et al. , 1994) , LSJ exhibits profound (see Gregory, McCloskey, & Landau, 2014, for a more de- tailed neuropsychological profile) . The retrograde memory impairment encompasses both episodic (auto- CEE EMECORETERMGEGERENGES 10 the aco biographical domain, extensive testing has revealed no memory for specific life events; for example, LSJ is unable. In testing of semantic memory, LSJ was severely impaired in iden- marks (2 of 26; see Duchaine, Germine, & Nakayama, 2007; Duchaine, Nieminen-von Wendt, New, & Kulomaki, 2003, for control means) . In testing with recall and recog: broad range of domains (e. g. , commercial logos, familiar songs) , including areas of premorbid expertise for LSJ (e. g. , famous artworks, classical music) , LSJ was uniformly and severely impaired (Gregory et al. , 2014) . LSJ s profound anterograde amnesia was evident on the Wechsler Memory Scale Il (Wechsler, 1997) , where she scored below the first percentile on the General Memory Index. Anecdotally, LSJ consistently shows no recollection for tasks when questioned after completing them and expresses no recollection for experimenters across sessions, despite having met them many times. In contrast to her impaired remote memory and inabil- ity to form new memories, LSJ scored in the normal range on tests of single-word reading and spelling (Wide Range Achievement Test HI, Wilkinson, 1993: 58th and 55th MTL cortex Hippocampus Controls (n = 4) GBLSJ mm Posterior < Anterior Volume (mm3) = = Ny a o a So So fo} So fo} Oo o o o o iz EC Po Oo SF SF FS = r & & & ee F & a g eg Ss Ss sy SF eM LF et Fh we null Figure 1.

Anecdotally, her language comprehension and production seem normal. LSJ s visuospatial abilities also appear intact: Her per- formance was normal on the Block Design and Matrix Reasoning subtests of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008) and on all subtests of the Visual Object and Space Percep- tion Battery (Warrington & James, 1991) . She also scored in the normal range (five of six subtests) on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (Peretz, Champod, & Hyde, 2003) . The only impairment was on a yes/no recognition memory subtest, which is uninformative, as she displayed a familiarity bias (answering yes to 29 of 30 items) . Finally, LSJ continues to make art, including drawings and water- color paintings, and she is able to sight read and play her viola. MTL VOLUME ANALYSIS To assess in detail the extent and location of LSJ s lesions, we acquired high-resolution anatomical MRI scans from LSJ and control participants. Participants Four controls were matched to LSJ on age (mean age = 62. 0 years, range = 57-65 years) and education (college educated) , had no history of neurological disease or dis- order, and were native English speakers. Participants were compensated $20 per hour. In this MRI study and the behavioral experiments below, informed written consent was obtained from all participants (for LSJ, with power of attorney) , and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Princeton University. Data Acquisition Data were acquired with a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner using a 16-channel head coil. We collected a high-resolution 3-D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (0. 9 X 0. 9 mm in-plane, 0. 9-mm thickness) , shown for LSJ in Figure 1A. For manual segmentation of MTLROIs, we collected a high-resolution T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence (33 slices, 0. 4 X 0. 4 mm in-plane, 3-mm thickness) , with oblique coronal slices aligned perpen- dicular to the anterior posterior axis of the hippocampus. Segmentation For each participant, parahippocampal cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, CA1, and CA2/3/DG (CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus cannot be separated at this resolution) were hand-segmented in each hemisphere on the T2-weighted anatomical images. The boundaries between regions were defined based on anatomical land- 1738 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience marks, following conventions used in previous studies (Schapiro et al. , 2012; Carr, Rissman, & Wagner, 2010) . Though it was difficult to identify certain anatomical land- marks for LSJ due to her damage, two coders performed independent segmentations as best as possible. Volume Analysis We calculated the volume of each MTL region based on the number of voxels falling within each hand-segmented ROI (Figure 1B) . Volumes were averaged across control participants and across the segmentations performed by the two coders for LSJ. There is substantial remaining tissue in LSJ s right parahippocampal cortex, right ento- rhinal cortex, and right perirhinal cortex. Relative to controls, LSJ has very little, if any, remaining tissue in left parahippocampal cortex, left entorhinal cortex, and left perirhinal cortex and virtually no tissue in hippocampus bilaterally. In addition, regions that receive projections from the MTL may also be affected as a result of damaged connectivity. EXPERIMENT 1 notice any patterns, noticed something about the patterns (could describe one pattern or knew that items came in groups but not which ones went together) , and noticed a substantial amount about the patterns (could accurately describe two or more patterns) . For LSJ, the tasks were conducted in the following order: shapes, scenes, syllables, and tones. Shapes and Figure 3.

This was also true across participants within each version (shape: t[6] = 2. 89, p = . 028; syllable: t (6] = 3. 57, p = . 012; scene: t (6] = 3. 29, p = . 017; tone: t[6] = 2. 73, p = . 034) . Indeed, there was no effect of version on performance (F[3, 24] = 0. 21, p = . 888) . These control data, in addition to providing a comparison with LSJ, also provide information about older adults SL abilities, which have been relatively un- explored (Campbell, Zimerman, Healey, Lee, & Hasher, 2012) . In contrast to the control groups, LSJ did not show evidence of learning the regularities in any version (Fig- ure 3, Table 1) . Across versions, her accuracy did not dif- fer from chance ( {3] = 1. 41, p = . 252) . She performed significantly worse than controls relative to their mean performance across version ( {3] = 4. 96, p = . 016) , and when comparing her mean performance to the con- trol distribution collapsed across versions ( {30] = 3. 41, p = . 002) . This provides an initial indication that LSJ has a deficit in SL. The low performance in the tone version is surprising. During the tone test, LSJ indicated that she was choosing the sequences that sounded familiar from 175) . This is of particular interest for the question regarding awareness of regularities. The participants who did not notice anything about the regularities (16 participants) performed significantly above chance (mean proportional correct = 0. 660, [15] = 3. 78, p = . 002) and no differently from the participants who did notice something about the patterns (12 participants; mean = 0. 745, [26] = 1. 39, p = . 176) ; no participants noticed a substantial amount about the patterns. EXPERIMENT 2 Control performance was not especially high in Experi- ment 1. Although most controls performed well and LSJ performed poorly, we wanted to gain greater confi- dence that she was outside the normal range. We there- fore repeated the same experiment using simpler regularities that we expected the controls to learn more robustly. If LSJ is fundamentally impaired in SL, her performance should remain at chance. Methods Participants LSJ and 20 new controls participated in exchange for mone- tary compensation.

Control participants were 34, p = . 029) . Indeed, there was no effect of version on performance (F[3, 16] = 0. 89, p = . 469) . LSJ was again unable to learn the regularities (Figure 4, Table 1) . Across versions, her accuracy did not differ from chance ( [3] = 0. 577, p = . 604) . She again performed sig- nificantly worse than controls relative to their mean per- formance across versions ( [3] = 3. 62, p = . 036) , and when comparing her mean performance to the control distribution collapsed across versions ( {22] = 3. 38, p = . 003) . There was no difference in LSJ s performance between Experiments 1 and 2 across versions ( [3] = 1. 32, p = . 278) . LSJ again did not show any bias to choose the alter- native on the left versus right side of the screen or the alternative that appeared first versus second. Across tasks, the average proportion of trials on which she chose the left alternative was exactly 0. 500, and the average pro- portion of trials on which she chose the first alternative was 0. 528 (vs. chance: [3] = 0. 322, p = . 769) . Across all ver- sions, controls requested 3. 40 trial repeats on average (SD across 20 participants = 3. 69) , and LSJ requested 4. 75 trial repeats on average (SD across four tasks = 2. 22) . As in Experiment 1, to analyze the on each trial, instead of a triplet/pair and a foil. One of the items (target) had been presented during exposure, and the other item (foil) had not been presented during exposure. Foils were the six items from the Experiment 1 stimulus set that did not appear in the Experiment 3 exposure phase. All six targets and foils were tested three times each, with every target paired randomly with three different foils, for a total of 18 trials. The instructions were identical to the previous experiments, except that the judgment was now about an image, syllable, or tone, instead of a subsequence. For LSJ, the tasks were conducted in the following order: shapes, scenes, syllables, and tones. They were administered all on one day. Two months elapsed be- tween the second test session for Experiment 2 and this test session. Results and Discussion In contrast to her failure on the eight tests of regularities in Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ showed successful discrimi- nation for items in the syllable and scene tests (Table 1) . Her accuracy was significantly above chance in these ver- sions by binomial test (syllable: p = . 031, scene: p = . 0001) . Despite being numerically above chance in the shape version, this level of accuracy did not reach sig- nificance (p = . 481) . As anticipated, the tone test was unsuccessful (p = 1. 0) . LSJ again did not show any bias to choose the alter- native on the left versus right side of the screen or the alternative that appeared first versus second. Across tasks, the average proportion of trials on which she chose the left alternative was 0. 514 (vs. chance: [3] = 0. 190, p = . 861) , and the average proportion of trials on which she chose the first alternative was 0. 542 (vs. chance: [3] = 1. 19, p = . 319) . Across all versions, LSJ requested 4. 75 trial repeats on average (SD across four tasks = 0. 957) . Overall, her robust familiarity with the syllable and scene items, and an indication of some familiarity with the shapes, suggests that LSJ understood the structure of the test, was capable of indicating her decision, and had been paying attention during the exposure phases. These findings indicate that her lack of SL in Experi- ments 1 and 2 reflects an inability to extract and/or express familiarity for regularities rather than a more basic inability to follow the protocol. 1744 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience GENERAL DISCUSSION Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the MTL is necessary for rapid SL. Across three experi- ments, amnesic patient LSJ was passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities. Regularities in Experiment 1 consisted of four triplets, which LSJ was unable to discriminate from foils regardless of stimulus type. Although above chance, control performance was weak, suggesting that we may not have had sufficient sensitivity to detect learning in LSJ. We thus simplified the regularities to three pairs in Experiment 2, which boosted control performance but left LSJ at chance. This lack of learning did not seem to reflect general difficulties with the task, as LSJ successfully discriminated individual items in Experiment 3. Her item familiarity was near- perfect for scenes, providing a stark contrast between her knowledge of items and regularities for at least that stimulus class. This was also true to some extent for syllables, although not for shapes (nor for tones, which would have required perfect pitch) . The collection of findings suggests that LSJ has a severe deficit in SL. Under some accounts of hippocampal and MTL func- tion, these findings are quite surprising. One reason is that the hippocampus is known to play an important role in conscious or declarative forms of memory (Squire et al. , 2004) . In contrast, SL is incidental and often im- plicit (Kim et al. , 2009; Turk-Browne et al. , 2005) . Indeed, in the present experiments, roughly half of the participants did not report noticing any regularities and yet still exhib- ited robust SL. Another way in which these findings are surprising is that the hippocampus has the unique capa- bility to encode individual experiences (McClelland et al. , 1995) , but SL requires the integration of multiple experi- ences. That is, a pair or triplet is impossible to segment from the continuous sequence of stimuli in which it is embedded after only one exposure it exists only the basic SRTT, it is never- theless engaged during learning (Schendan et al. , 2003) , and versions of the task with higher-order temporal re- lationships are somewhat impaired after MTL damage (Curran, 1997) . This suggests that temporal procedural learning, like more passive observational learning, may recruit the MTL for relatively complex relationships. Our results also speak to a debate within the SL litera- ture regarding whether SL is supported by modality- specific brain systems (Conway & Christiansen, 2005) or a domain-general system (Kirkham et al. , 2002) . LSJ has damage to a relatively focal area of her brain yet dis- played deficits in two forms of visual and two forms of auditory SL. This finding strongly suggests that learning depends at least partially on a shared system (the MTL) . Input to and output from the MTL is processed in modality-specific areas, however, raising the possibility that constraints there will modulate the expression of learning. In our experiments, we did not find any differ- ences between modalities, although differences have been reported elsewhere (Conway & Christiansen, 2005, 2009) . If exposed to regularities extensively (e. g. , for several months) , it is possible that LSJ would be able to learn them via modality-specific, local perceptual learning circuitry. However, the rapid SL of interest here seems to occur in a domain-general system. It is important to note that LSJ s damage spanned hippo- campus and MTL cortex bilaterally as well as the left ante- rior lateral temporal",
        "other": "Fiser & Aslin, 2001, 2002a; Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999; Saffran et al. , 1996) . The need to extract statistics over several exposures, along with the fact that SL is largely automatic and implicit (Kim, Seitz, Feenstra, & Shams, 2009; Turk-Browne, Junge, & Scholl, 2005) , suggests that it might be accom- plished in sensory or association cortex (Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001; Gabrieli, Fleischman, Keane, Reminger, & Morrell, 1995; McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995) or in the striatal memory system (Knowlton, Mangels, & Squire, 1996) . In contrast, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, which specializes in declarative, rapid learning of individual episodes (Squire, Stark, & Clark, 2004) , might not be expected to be involved. \"Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regulari- ties in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, success- fully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by show- ing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed. These findings provide converging support for the importance of the MTL in extracting temporal regularities. [I There are several reasons, however, to suspect that the MTL, and hippocampus in particular, may be the most relevant neural circuitry. First, although the learning re- quires several exposures, it occurs on a timescale that is consistent with the rapid binding known to occur in the hippocampus (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993) and less consistent with the typically much slower cortical learn- ing for novel information. Second, fMRI studies have demonstrated the involve- ment of the hippocampus in SL. If two objects consis- tently appear in succession, the representations of these objects in the hippocampus and MTL cortex become more similar to each other (Schapiro, Kustner, & Turk- Browne, 2012) . The hippocampus and MTL cortex are also responsive to various kinds of temporal statistical information (Bornstein & Daw, 2012; Durrant, Cairney, & Lewis, 2012; Turk-Browne, Scholl, Johnson, & Chun, 2010; Turk-Browne, Scholl, Chun, & Johnson, 2009; Harrison, Duggins, & Friston, 2006; Rose, Haider, & Buchel, 2005; Schendan, Searl, Melrose, & Stern, 2003) . The third reason to suspect that the MTL may be in- volved is that, despite surface appearances, SL may be closely related to other forms of learning that the MTL is thought to specialize in. The hippocampus, in particu- lar, is crucial for the rapid encoding of relations between arbitrary elements of sensory information (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993) . Learning and remembering regulari- ties also requires binding stimuli that are temporally or spatially associated. In SL, this binding occurs over multi- ple experiences, and indeed, this is also a property of Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 20: 8, pp. 1736-1747 doi: 10. 1162{jocn_a_00578 Pe BPARISEATS/OeAPG_ermpe pipe taps We began by testing LSJ on a canonical SL task (Fiser & Aslin, 2002a; Saffran et al. , 1996) . We repeated this experiment four times, with shapes, syllables, scenes, and tones, to test whether any deficits generalize across mo- dalities and stimulus types. Methods Participants LSJ and 28 healthy controls participated in exchange for monetary compensation ($12 per hour) . One additional control participant was excluded because she reported that, during the test phase, she sometimes used the left and right side keys to indicate the first- and second- presented alternative, respectively, instead of the in- tended mapping to left and right screen/speaker. Note that the possibility for this sort of confusion did not arise for LSJ, because she responded by pointing to the side of the screen or the speaker where her preferred response alternative was presented (described below) . Controls were matched to LSJ s age (mean age = 62. 9 years, range = 57-67 years) and educational level. They had normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal vision, had no history of neurological disease or disorder, and were native English speakers. The control participants were each randomly assigned to one version of the experiment shape, syllable, scene, or tone (seven unique participants per version) . LSJ partici- pated in all four versions of the experiment. Note that test- ing a participant repeatedly is unusual for SL studies, which generally involve incidental learning and surprise tests.

Auditory syllables and tones were also used. would know how the regularities were constructed (based on the structure of the alternatives in the test phase) and would expect to be tested on these regularities. However, we hypothesized that LSJ would have difficulty with SL, and so any benefit from repeated testing worked against our hypothesis. In any case, we saw no evidence that LSJ remembered participating in any of the SL tasks. Apparatus and Stimuli Visual and auditory stimuli were presented using Matlab with Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) ona MacBook laptop. Participants sat approximately 46 cm from the monitor without head restraint. Shape and scene stimuli subtended roughly 3. 4 and 10. 1 of visual angle, respec- tively. For tone and syllable versions, two portable speakers were placed on either side of the laptop, approximately 30 cm away from the edge of the laptop on each side. Shape stimuli (Figure 2A) were 12 nonsense shapes used previously in SL studies (e. g. , Fiser & Aslin, 2001) , pre- sented on a white background. Scene stimuli (Figure 2B) were 12 outdoor scene photographs, presented on a black background. Syllable stimuli were generated from the Mbrola (tcts. fpms. ac. be/synthesis/) speech synthesizer with a male voice and included: bo, di, nu, ru, la, ze, me, ka, wu, va, pi, and fo. Tone stimuli were pure tones at the following frequencies: 262, 278, 294, 311, 330, 349, 370, 392, 415, 440, 466, and 494 Hz. Stimulus duration was 0. 5 sec, and the ISI was 0. 5 sec for shapes, scenes, and tones. For syllables, a continuous sequence was synthe- sized with a syllable duration of 0. 25 sec and no ISI. Procedure The experiment was conducted in two phases: exposure and test. In the exposure phase, participants were in- structed to watch or listen to a sequence of shapes, sylla- bles, scenes, or tones (with no mention of a memory test) . Syllables and tones were played from both speak- ers. Shape, scene, and tone sequences were 288 items long and lasted 4. 8 min, and syllables sequences were 1, 152 items long and lasted 4. 8 min. For each stimulus type, the 12 items (e. g. , A, B, C, . . . L) were randomly assigned without replacement to the first, second, or third positions of four triplets (e. g. , ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL) . Items within a triplet always appeared in a fixed order consecutively in the sequence. The order of the triplets was random, except that no triplet could be re- peated in immediate succession (e. g. , ABCABC) and no pair of triplets could be repeated in immediate succession (e. g. , ABCDEFABCDEF) . These standard constraints were imposed to minimize the likelihood of explicit detection of the patterns. Control participants were given the same item-to-triplet assignments as LSJ in case certain items were more or less associable, but the order of triplets in the sequence was randomized for each participant. In the test phase, participants completed 32 two- alternative forced-choice test trials, judging the relative familiarity of a triplet from the exposure phase com- pared with a foil. The experimenter explained how the task worked and how to make responses and then asked if the participant had any questions. The experi- menter supervised the test phase to make sure the par- ticipant complied with instructions and to be available in case any questions arose. The experimenter encour- aged participants to make their best guess when they were unsure, to facilitate expression of implicit recogni- tion (Voss & Paller, 2010) . The four foils were composed of three unique items from three different triplets, such that the items could never have appeared consecutively during exposure (e. g. , AEI, DHL, GKC, JBF) . The four target triplets were paired Schapiro et al. 1739 Pe BPARISEATS/OeAPG_ermpe pipe taps paMssapAapY Avog papeupApcCpepeoTuMod RN TUSOU. E7800 TZ0% KEW UZORUSMAMDSEPTTeIIPN TIO GUT POS ASOD CRW VHP AG ILS with each of the four foils once in the first half of test trials and again in the second half. Otherwise, the order of the test trials was random. Thus, target triplets and foils were presented equally often during test, and any relative famil- iarity for the target triplets must reflect SL from the expo- sure phase. On each test trial of the visual versions of the experi- ment, the three items from the first alternative (counter- balanced to be the target triplet or foil) were presented on the left or right side of the screen, with the same tim- ing as during exposure. After a 1-sec gap, the three items from the second alternative (target triplet or foil, which- ever did not occur previously) were presented on the opposite side of the screen. The side of the screen on which the target triplet was presented was determined randomly on each trial. Control participants responded by pressing a key corresponding to the side on which the more familiar stimulus sequence had been pre- sented. They then pressed a different key to initiate the next trial. LSJ indicated her responses by pointing to a side of the screen or speaker or by verbally saying left or right. The experimenter pressed the keyboard button to initiate the next trial. We decided not to have LSJ use the keyboard for two reasons. First, we wanted to be sure to have the opportunity to remind her on every trial about the task instructions before the trial began. Second, this simplified the task by removing the need to remember response mappings she simply pointed to or verbally indicated her choice. We wanted to do everything possible to facilitate expression of her knowledge. LSJ s responses were recorded by the experimenter, and the recorded responses were subsequently verified against a video recording of the test session. All participants had the option of viewing the trial again before making their decision. Controls used a keypress to repeat the trial, and LSJ indicated verbally whether she would like to repeat the trial. We included this trial repeat option in the experiment to ensure that LSJ had sufficient Opportunity to observe and consider the alternatives. The procedure was identical for auditory versions of the experiment, except that sequences of syllables or tones were played from the left or right speaker instead of displayed on the left or right side of the screen. Additionally, arrows appeared on the screen for the duration of the alternative, pointing to the speaker that was playing the stimulus. For controls, after the experiment was over, we asked (1) what they did while watching or listening in the exposure phase, (2) whether they used any particular strategy during the test (and if so, what strategy) , and (3) whether they noticed any repeating patterns during the exposure phase (and if so, what the patterns were) . For Question 1, the responses were grouped into four categories: simply watched/listened, looked for patterns in the sequence, counted the items, and assigned names to the items. For Question 2, the responses were again grouped into four categories: no particular strategy, tried to think back to exposure phase, used visual or auditory properties, and said the names of the items.

For controls, the mean performance and +1 SEM in parentheses are reported for each task and for the two experiments in which controls participated (Experiments 1 and 2) . scenes were administered on the first day, and syllables and tones were administered on a second day a month later. On each testing day, LSJ participated in several other experiments and had limited availability. We chose tasks that seemed maximally different from the other ones on that day to minimize interference. Results and Discussion Control groups exhibited reliable SL, accurately choosing the triplets as more familiar than the foils in the test phase of all versions (Figure 3, Table 1) . Collapsing across ver- sion, controls were significantly above chance ( (27] = 6. 42, p < . 001) . Examining reliability across the her past musi- cal experience (although she seemed to understand that this was not what we were asking her to do) . By chance, these familiar sequences were foils rather than triplets, leading to below-chance performance. We conclude that he results provide no indication that LSJ had learned the riplets in any version of the experiment. LSJ did not show any bias to choose the alternative on the left versus right side of the screen or the alternative that appeared first versus second. Across tasks, the aver- age proportion of trials on which she chose the left alter- native was 0. 563 (vs. chance: [3] = 1. 633, p = . 201) , and the average proportion of trials on which she chose the first alternative was 0. 422 (vs. chance: [3] = 1. 89, p = . 155) . This suggests that she was not simply neglecting a side of the screen or showing a preference for a par- ticular order or location. Across all versions, controls requested 7. 86 trial repeats on average (SD across 28 par- ticipants = 9. 29) , and LSJ requested 21. 5 trial repeats on average (SD across four tasks = 10. 61) . To analyze the control participant debriefing responses, we collapsed across modalities and performed one-way ANOVAs to assess whether there were any differences in test performance across response types. For each of the three debriefing questions, we did not find any relationship between responses and performance level (ps > . selected using the same criteria as in Experiment 1 (here, mean age = 62. 1 years, range = 57-67 years) . They were each randomly assigned to one version of the experiment shape, syllable, scene, or tone (five unique participants per version) . LSJ participated in all four ver- sions of the experiment. Stimuli Stimuli were 6 of the 12 stimuli from each stimulus class in Experiment 1. The subset was chosen randomly for shapes, syllables, and scenes. For tones, the frequencies 262, 294, 330, 370, 415, and 466 Hz were chosen to span the initial frequency range from Experiment 1. Procedure The exposure phase was nearly identical to Experiment 1. The only differences were that six rather than 12 items were presented per stimulus class, the six items were divided into pairs instead of triplets, and there were no constraints on sequence randomization (repetitions were allowed) . These modifications dramatically simpli- fied the regularities, mirroring a design that has been used to examine temporal and spatial visual SL in infants (Fiser & Aslin, 2002b; Kirkham, Slemmer, & Johnson, 2002) . The total number of items in each sequence and the duration of the sequence were matched to Experi- ment 1. Thus, in addition to using simpler regularities, each pattern was presented approximately 1. 5 times more frequently than in Experiment 1. These changes were all intended to boost overall SL in controls. The test phase was the same as Experiment 1, except that the test trials were generated from pairs. Now, three target pairs and three foils (where a foil consisted of two items from two different target pairs) were combined in all nine possible ways. Each combination was repeated once in the first and second halves of the test, for a total of 18 trials. The target pair and foil were again presented consecutively in a counterbalanced order, with the same timing as exposure, and with the left or right speaker or side of the screen. For LSJ, the tasks were conducted in the following order: tones, shapes, syllables, and scenes. Tones and shapes were administered on the first day, and syllables and scenes were administered on a second day approximately a month later. The second test session for Experiment 1 and the first test session for Experiment 2 were approxi- mately 4 months apart. Results and Discussion Control groups again exhibited reliable SL, accurately choosing the pairs as more familiar than the foils in the test phase of all versions (Figure 4, Table 1) . Collapsing across version, controls were significantly above chance (t{19] = 8. 78, p < . 001) and significantly better than controls Figure 4.

Examining relia- bility across the mean performance in each version, control accuracy was significantly above chance ( [3] = 9. 24, p = . 003) and significantly better than in Experi- ment 1 ( [3] = 3. 63, p = . 036) . Test accuracy was also above chance across participants within each version (shape: t[4] = 9. 49, p = . 0007; syllable: [4] = 3. 59, p = . 023; scene: [4] = 4. 47, p = . 011; tone: [4] = 3. debriefing re- sponses, we collapsed across modalities and performed one-way ANOVAs to assess whether there were any differ- ences in test performance across response types. For each of the three debriefing questions, we did not find any relationship between responses and performance level (ps > . 193) . As in Experiment 1, the participants who did not notice anything about the patterns (seven par- ticipants) performed significantly above chance (mean = 0. 762, t[6] = 3. 84, p = . 009) and no differently from the participants who noticed something (eight participants; mean = 0. 771, {13] = 0. 118, p = . 908) or noticed a sub- stantial amount (five participants; mean = 0. 867, {[10] = 1. 04, p = 325) . These findings provide converging support for LSJ s deficit in SL by closely replicating Experiment 1. They are perhaps even more striking because the regularities were much simpler (fewer items, fewer groups of items, and more repetitions) and control participants performed better in this experiment. EXPERIMENT 3 Across two experiments, LSJ was unable to discriminate regularities from foils at test. It remains possible, how- ever, that this deficit reflects general difficulties with aspects of the task that are unrelated to SL per se. For example, LSJ may have been unable to pay attention during the exposure phase or could have had trouble fol- lowing instructions or indicating her decisions in the test phase. To address these issues, we repeated the expo- sure phase from Experiment 2 but designed a different test phase that closely matched the task demands of the previous experiments but did not require knowledge of temporal statistics. Specifically, instead of choosing which of two sequences was more familiar, the task re- quired choosing which of two individual items was more familiar based on exposure (where one item was from the exposure phase and the other was novel) . There is reason to believe that LSJ may be able to exhibit familiarity for items despite not being able to do so for regularities. In particular, rats with damage to the hippocampus cannot remember which of two odors came first in a sequence, but they can remember whether an odor was present in the sequence or not (Fortin, Agster, & Eichenbaum, 2002) . Additionally, patients with selective hippocampal damage can have relatively intact item familiarity (Mayes, Holdstock, Isaac, Hunkin, & Roberts, 2002) . Such familiarity may be supported by perirhinal cortex (Bowles et al. , 2007; Eichenbaum, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007; Brown & Aggleton, 2001) and parahippocampal cortex (Martin, McLean, O'Neil, & Kohler, 2013) both of which are partially pre- served in LSJ s right hemisphere. Moreover, visual cortex exhibits attenuated responses to repeated versus novel stimuli, which may also support item familiarity (Turk- Browne, Yi, & Chun, 2006; Henson, Shallice, Gorno- Tempini, & Dolan, 2002) . evertheless, our goal in this experiment was not to establish the neural basis of item familiarity nor to show that LSJ s item familiarity is intact relative to controls. Rather, we sought to demonstrate simply that LSJ can succeed at a task highly similar to those in Experiments 1 and 2. She may succeed for a variety of reasons, including reliance on different brain structures or reduced task difficulty. Regardless, above-chance performance would allow us to establish that LSJ can pay attention during exposure, follow instructions at test, and make reliable amiliarity-based judgments. To match previous experiments, we tested LSJ on item amiliarity using all four stimulus sets. However, the tone test has a different character than the other three tests: To discriminate individual tones requires absolute or perfect pitch (sequences can benefit from relative itch) . Without such ability, her test performance cannot be easily interpreted. We therefore tested whether LSJ has absolute pitch by playing 24 computer-generated iano notes and asking her to provide the letter name corresponding to the note. She was no different than chance (p = . 646, binomial test) , correctly identifying only 3 of 24 notes. We therefore did not expect LSJ to be successful at the tone item test but collected the data for completeness.

TZ0% KEW UZORUSMAMDSEPTTeIIPN TIO GUT POS ASOD CRW VHP AG ILS Methods Participants LSJ participated in exchange for monetary compensation. Stimuli and Procedure The stimuli and exposure phases were identical to Experi- ment 2. The test phase was similar to Experiments 1 and 2, but two individual items were presented sequentially by way of the con- stituent items appearing together in various contexts. There are other perspectives on hippocampal and MTL function that accommodate our findings more naturally. These accounts focus on the information processing capa- bilities of the hippocampus rather than awareness (Shohamy & Turk-Browne, 2013; Henke, 2010) in particular, its abil- ity to rapidly learn relational, configural, and contextual infor- mation (Ranganath, 2010; Rudy & Sutherland, 1995; Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993) . Several studies of patients with hippocampal damage support these perspectives. For example, with damage that includes the hippocampus, contextual cuing is impaired (Chun & Phelps, 1999) and eye movements no longer track associative memory or relational violations (Hannula, Ryan, Tranel, & Cohen, 2007; Ryan, Althoff, Whitlow, & Cohen, 2000) . Our findings extend these prior studies by showing that the hippo- campus is needed to extract regularities from a continuous sequence of stimuli, a key feature of learning in the real world.

TZ0% KEW UZORUSMAMDSEPTTeIIPN TIO GUT POS ASOD CRW VHP AG ILS Patient studies in artificial grammar learning (AGL) a paradigm involving exposure to strings with certain letter transition probabilities and subsequent string grammati- cality judgments seem, on the surface, to contradict this narrative. Specifically, AGL can be intact in patients with MTL damage (Knowlton, Ramus, & Squire, 1992) . Moreover, although AGL sometimes engages the MTL, it also engages the striatum (Lieberman, Chang, Chiao, Bookheimer, & Knowlton, 2004) , suggesting that the striatum may be sufficient for learning when the MTL is damaged. However, the MTL may nevertheless contribute to AGL in normal individuals. These different brain sys- tems seem to support different aspects of AGL, as re- vealed by their connection to different strategies for expressing knowledge of string grammaticality: Hippo- campal activity is associated with comparing the surface similarity of groups of items at test to items during expo- sure (Opitz & Friederici, 2004) , whereas the striatum is associated with grammatical rule adherence independent of similarity (Lieberman et al. , 2004) . Indeed, in a version of the AGL task in which both patients with MTL damage and controls always rely on a similarity-based strategy, patients do show a deficit in AGL (Channon et al. , 2002) . The SL paradigm, as used in the current experi- ments, also tests surface similarity between groups of items at test and exposure, which helps reconcile our findings with the AGL literature. The serial reaction time task (SRTT) , in which par- ticipants are cued to make button presses that have re- peating temporal structure, represents another type of temporal learning that seems to be preserved after MTL damage (Reber & Squire, 1994) . This task, like some forms of AGL, is thought to depend on the basal ganglia (Berns, Cohen, & Mintun, 1997; Rauch et al. , 1997; Jackson, Jackson, Harrison, Henderson, & Kennard, 1995; Knopman & Nissen, 1991) . Although the MTL does not appear to be required for cortex. We thus cannot dissociate the role of MTL cortex, the hippocampus proper, and the ante- rior temporal cortex in producing the observed deficits. Previous work has implicated all of these regions in associa- tive learning (Schapiro, Rogers, Cordova, Turk-Browne, & Botvinick, 2013; Schapiro et al. , 2012; Li & DiCarlo, 2008; Miyashita, 1988) , but there is evidence that MTL cortex may be necessary in order for the learning to occur in anterior temporal cortex (Higuchi & Miyashita, 1996) . Future work, including with patients with more selective hippocampal damage, will be crucial to better understand the contribu- tions of these different regions. A related issue is that MTL damage likely has down- stream consequences for other brain regions to which it projects. It is possible that these other regions are more important for SL than the MTL and that SL does not occur in LSJ because the functions of these regions are disrupted by a lack of MTL input. Even if true, the fact that MTL damage disrupted SL means that it is causally involved in the learning process. Moreover, prior whole-brain fMRI studies have reported selective engage- ment of the MTL, and hippocampus in particular, during SL (e. g. , Turk-Browne et al. , 2010; Harrison et al. , 2006) , suggesting that it does play a primary role. Another limitation of the current study is that some individual control participants performed near chance. This raises the question of whether LSJ is truly impaired relative to controls: Perhaps some normal individuals are generally bad at SL, and LSJ simply falls into this category by coincidence. That is, the variation in control perfor- mance may reflect individual differences (Zimmerer, Cowell, & Varley, 2011; Visser, Raijmakers, & Pothos, 2009) , as opposed to a learning process that is equally robust across individuals in the normal population but corrupted by various sources of noise. There are two ways to distinguish between these possibilities. First, the same control participants could be repeatedly tested to see if they consistently perform at the same level, consistent with stable individual differences. However, this is not possible in the case of SL, as repeated testing would make partici- pants aware of the test phase and structure of the regula- rities, altering the nature of the process under investigation. Second, even with only one test, other measures could be identified that reliably predict SL performance, again con- sistent with stable individual differences. We explored whether debriefing responses could provide such a mea- sure, but they did not relate to performance. Without such evidence, we have made the tentative assumption that control variation reflects samples drawn from a noisy uni- modal distribution, and in this sense, LSJ falls outside the Schapiro et al. 1745 Pe BPARISEATS/OeAPG_ermpe pipe taps paMssapAapY Avog papeupApcCpepeoTuMod SLSOD. P/ 8120! TZ0% KEW UZORUSMAMDSEPTTeIIPN TIO GUT POS ASOD CRW VHP AG ILS distribution. Nevertheless, future studies with more pa- tients and better individual difference measures are clearly needed. Overall, the results of this study add to the literature demonstrating that the hippocampus can rapidly and inci- dentally form associations between temporally or spatially related objects in the environment. The unique contribu- tion of our work is to show that this capability extends to a more naturalistic situation in which the associations of interest need to be extracted from a continuous sequence of information. In other words, the hippocampus can detect regularities even when there is no spatial or temporal segmentation no trial structure to define the associa- tions. This study thus provides strong converging evidence with neuroimaging studies (Schapiro et al. , 2012; Turk- Browne et al. , 2009) that the MTL is important for SL.

Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Yamagata University Graduate School of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan; \"Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences, Niigata University of Health and Welfare, Niigata, Japan; Department of Neurology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan; Department of Behavioral Neurology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan ABSTRACT Topographical disorientation (TD) in novel environments is considered to be a part of anterograde amnesia. A 56-year-old woman presented with pure TD only in novel environments following limbic encephalitis. She could not remember directions inside the hospital on weekly outpatient visits; however, her verbal and visual anterograde memories were normal. In the test of learning photographs of scenes, faces, and objects, only her scores for landscapes were worse than those in healthy controls. These findings suggested that her TD specific to landscapes and directions in novel environments was caused by category-specific memory impairment related to bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal dysfunction. Introduction Topographical disorientation (TD) refers to navigational impairment caused by brain damage (Aguirre & D Esposito, 1999; Barrash, 1998; Lopez, Caffo, & Bosco, 2018) . It is char- acterized by the impairment of spatial and navigational abil- ities in real-world environments and is associated with various conditions, including dementia, traumatic brain injuries, stroke, epilepsy, and developmental disorders (Aguirre & D Esposito, 1999; Bird, Vargha-Khadem, & Burgess, 2008; Lopez et al. , 2018; Pai & Jacobs, 2004) . Aguirre and D Esposito (1999) proposed a four-category taxonomy of TD: egocentric disorientation, heading (allo- centric) disorientation, landmark agnosia, and anterograde disorientation. Egocentric disorientation involves a severe def- icit in representing the relative location of objects with respect to the self. In severe forms of this syndrome, patients are equally impaired in familiar and unfamiliar environment way- finding tasks. Egocentric disorientation is associated with bilat- eral or right posterior parietal lobe damage. Heading (allocentric) disorientation involves the failure to derive directional information from landmarks. Patients suffer- ing from heading (allocentric) disorientation also exhibit ser- ious impairment in map-drawing tasks. It could also be described as allocentric disorientation because patients form unreliable object-centered mental representations of an envir- onment. The cerebral area associated with this syndrome is the right retrosplenial cortex. Landmark agnosia is the inability to recognize salient environmental features and familiar land- marks, which has implications for navigation. The responsible lesions are situated in the medial part of the occipital lobe, involving the fusiform and lingual gyri. Patients with heading (allocentric) disorientation or landmark agnosia frequently lose CONTACT Yuka Oishi ) oishi@nuhw. ac. jp This research was conducted at Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital. 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group ARTICLE HISTORY Received 23 October 2018 Accepted 4 July 2019 KEYWORDS Topographical disorientation; landmark agnosia; directional disorientation; hippocampal gyrus; parahippocampal gyrus their way in both familiar and novel areas, such as in the admitting hospital after onset of illness. Aguirre and D Esposito (1999) described anterograde disor- ientation as a topographical impairment primarily confined to novel environments. Ten patients who lost their way only in novel environments were reported previously (Epstein, De Yoe, Press, Rosen, & Kanwisher, 2001; Habib & Sirigu, 1987; Katayama, Takahashi, Ogawara, & Hattori, 1999; Ross, 1980; Sato, Usui, Sasagasako, Irie, & Takenoyama, 2004; Takahashi & Kawamura, 2002; Turriziani, Carlesimo, Perri, & Caltagirone, 2003) . They showed preserved way-finding skills in familiar environments but encountered great difficulties in encoding spatial information in novel environments. Some of them had orientation difficulties in unfamiliar parts of the town but preserved recognition of novel landmarks (Habib & Sirigu, 1987; ima- gery of landmarks (Ghaem et al. , 1997) . Remote and new spatial memory appears to have different neuronal bases. Moscovitch et al. (2005) proposed that a reciprocal network among hippocampal-neocortical regions, including the parahippocampus, retrosplenial, superior medial parietal, and lingual gyrus, is important for remote spatial and episodic memory. Another study showed that familiar envir- onments seem to be processed by an extended temporal- frontal network, whereas recently learned environments require activation of the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, and lingual gyrus (Boccia et al. , 2014) . Here we present a case with anterograde disorientation in novel environments that was associated with anterograde amnesia confined to topographical information. This case was unique in that the patient had intact anterograde memory except for landscapes, indicating category-specific memory loss for environments due to bilateral parahippocampal damage. Additionally, we performed systematic examinations to assess egocentric and allocentric disorientation and landmark agnosia for both familiar and novel environments to clarify the nature and mechanism of anterograde disorientation. Control data for TD assessments were provided by 11 healthy adult women matched for age, education, and IQ (mean age = 56. 7 years, SD = 5. 91 years; mean education = 13. 8 years, SD = 1. 80 years; mean Japanese Adult Reading Test UART) = 111. 1, SD = 6. 44) . The exclusion criteria for the healthy controls were as follows: (1) history of neurological, psychiatric, or severe ocular diseases, and (2) language deficits that hindered task execution. No healthy control participants complained of TD. Prior to the study, all participants received a written descrip- tion of the study and the procedure. The associated safety risks/ warnings were explained to the participants, and they provided written informed consent before participating. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Yamagata University. Case report A 56-year-old right-handed female (KW) with 14 years of edu- cation visited a clinic for headache and nausea but returned home untreated because of no abnormal findings on head computed tomography. Three days later, she developed mem- ory loss and disorientation and was admitted for suspected encephalitis. On initial examination, she was alert but had spatio-temporal disorientation and amnesia. No apparent neu- rological deficits were observed, including in the motor and sensory systems. We diagnosed her with limbic encephalitis and provided medication. Despite a convulsion episode on hospital day 4, electroencephalographic findings were normal, and she had no subsequent epileptic seizures. Three weeks after onset, she was alert and could walk without assistance; however, she could not remember the location of her hospital room or the direction to the rehabilitation room she visited daily. Two months after discharge, she was well oriented in time and place and had no problems with household or work- place duties; however, she was unable to learn directions to the hospital or drug store and had to rely on billboards and guide- boards as landmarks. Therefore, at 3 months after onset, we informed the patient of the clinical significance of conducting comprehensive neuropsychological assessments for rehabilitation purposes and obtained her consent. Neuroradiological examination MRI was performed 7 days after disease onset. MRI with fluid attenuation inversion recovery pulse sequences revealed bilat- eral hyperintense signals in the hippocampus, parahippocam- pus ambient gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum in the acute phase as well as at 3 months after onset (Figure 1) . Neuropsychological assessment KW underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assess- ment of general intelligence, memory, executive functions, and spatial abilities. Her general cognitive ability was tested using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997a) and JART; Matsuoka et al. , 2002) similar to the National Adult Reading Test. Anterograde memory was evaluated using the Wechsler Memory Scale- Revised (WMS-R; Wechsler, 1997b) , Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Osterrieth, 1944) , Benton Visual Retention Test (Benton, 1992) , Paired Verbal Paired Associate Learning Test (Miyake & Uchida, 1923) , and Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (Wilson, Cockburn, & Baddeley, 1992) . Retrograde mem- ory was assessed using Kopelman et al. 's (1989) question- naire of autobiographical memory. Executive function was tested by verbal fluency (number of animals named in 1 min) and the Trail Making Test (Part A, Part B) in Japanese (Abe et al. , 2004) . Table 1 shows KW s performance on neuropsychological examinations with the published standard scores. Her general attention was well preserved, as indicated by good performance of digit span forward and backward (7 and 5) , and visual tapping span (6) . Her verbal |Q was 116 and performance IQ was 112 on WAIS-III and performance IQ was 111 on JART. Anterograde verbal and visual memories were well preserved. An autobiogra- phical memory test revealed retention of childhood and early adulthood memories as well as memories of events up until 10 years earlier; however, there was no retention of memories of events that occurred thereafter, indicating retrograde amnesia for a period of approximately 10 years. There were no signs of aphasia, acalculia, left-right disorientation, constructional apraxia, unilateral spatial neglect, visual agnosia, ideomotor apraxia, ideational apraxia, or prosopagnosia. Executive func- tions were also preserved. Figure 1. Axial and coronal magnetic resonance images of the patient's brain show high-intensity signals in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. (a) and (b) Seven days after disease onset and (c) 95 days after disease onset. Experimental investigations To clarify the nature of her TD and related dysfunctions, we performed the following systematic neuropsychological exami- nations. We investigated higher visual functions that might affect perception of landmarks or visuospatial processes. Next, we examined landmark agnosia and egocentric and allocentric dis- orientation in both familiar and novel environments. First, we assessed her ability to recognize landmarks in familiar environ- ments, famous buildings that she knew well before the onset of the disease, and hospital scenes newly learned after admission. Second, anterograde and retrograde memory for landscape was examined. Third, egocentric orientation for famil- iar and novel environments was observed by examining spatial orientation in novel and familiar environments. Fourth, allo- centric orientation for familiar and novel environments was assessed by map-drawing tests and the route-learning test. Higher visual function As shown in Table 2, KW's score on the Developmental Test of Visual Perception for Adults (DTVP-A; Reynold, Pearson, & Voress, 2002) was within the normal range in every category and the overlapping figures in Birmingham Object Recognition Battery (BORB; Riddoch & Humphreys, 1993) showed no abnormalities. These findings indicated preservation of higher-level visual per- ception. Her score on the Visual Perception Test for Agnosia (VPTA; Japan society for higher brain dysfunction, 2003) was within the normal range in every subtest, which revealed preserved percep- tion of shape, color, object, letter, and face. The face recognition NEUROCASE () 3 subtests of VPTA include matching unknown faces, same/different judgment of unknown faces in different views, and gender and age judgments of unknown faces. Perception of landscapes and scenes We examined whether she could visually perceive and discriminate landscapes/scenes or not. KW was asked to verbally describe hospital scenes and outdoor landscapes (in response to five choices; 20 questions) , judge similari- ties and differences in photos of streetscapes/buildings (five choices; 20 questions) and hospital scenes (five choices; 20 questions) , and match unknown landscapes (five choices; 20 questions) . She answered all questions accurately, exhibiting good cognition of buildings and landscapes. Her ability to identify real landscapes was assessed by asking her to look out of a window on the seventh floor of the hospital to identify buildings and objects. She was able to identify all buildings and objects correctly (e. g. , a building of the university, a bridge over the river, and a hut in the parking lot) . Landmark recognition in familiar environments We investigated how the patient identified buildings and streetscapes in the area where she had lived for more than 30 years. She could identify buildings that had already been in that area up until 10 years before disease onset but not those built or remodeled in the last 10 years during the period of her retrograde amnesia. She could also accurately describe the appearance of her house and other familiar buildings. Recognition of famous buildings and landscapes Using the method of McCarthy, Evans, and Hodges (1996) , we examined KW s knowledge of famous buildings and landscapes that were familiar to her before disease onset. The healthy controls performed the same tasks as the patient. They were asked to name and describe 30 photographs of famous buildings and landscapes around the world (eg. , the pyramids in Egypt and the Golden Pavilion in Japan) and 30 photographs of famous people as acontrol task. She provided 83. 3% correct responses on recognizing buildings or landscapes (controls 83. 3%; standard deviation [SD] = 6. 8) and that for faces was 90. 9% (controls 84. 5%; SD = 6. 5) , which fell within 1SD of the means obtained by the control individuals. Recognition of newly learned scenes in the hospital KW was asked to recognize and identify scenes inside the hospital and draw the appearance of the hospital building. She had been admitted for approximately 2 months and was now visiting weekly on an outpatient basis. She recog- nized 11 (73. 3%) of the 15 photos of scenes inside the hospital but could identify only 6 scenes accurately (40%) . When asked about the appearance of the hospital building, she could not recall the complex shape of the hospital building with brick siding but said that the hospital was a box-shaped gray building. 4 Y.

The stimuli comprised 40 black and white photographs of scenes containing buildings but no people or signboards, faces of Japanese people, and objects (e. g. , briefcase, paper bag) . The pictures were grouped into five sets of eight for each stimulus type. Each set contained four similar scenes. In the case of scenes, the grouped pictures shared the same general form but differed in the shape and/or config- uration of some features. The test was presented on a laptop (Ultrabook, NEC) with the monitor (200 mm x 320 mm) set to optimal brightness. KW and the controls viewed the screen from a distance of approximately 50 cm. Detailed instructions were given immediately before the test. At first, we presented eight scenery images for each scene learning test. Image stimuli were presented in a central position for 10 s and then automatically changed. After a 5-min interference task, subjects viewed a series of 40 pictures on the screen and indicated whether they found each picture pleasant or unpleasant. Each picture was presented for 5 s regardless of when the pleasant/unpleasant response was made. For trials in which no response was made within this time, subjects were shown a brief message asking them to try to respond more quickly on subsequent trials. Participants were then tested on their ability to recognize these scenes in a five- alternative forced-choice task. A total of 48 trials were completed per test. Feedback was not provided during the test. The percen- tage of correct responses was determined. The same tests were performed using faces and objects as control stimuli, and KW s results were compared with those of the control participants. We considered KW's performance impaired when it scores less than the controls mean 2SD. The patient's performance on the faces and objects tests was well within the normal range. In contrast, her performance on the scenes test was less than the mean 2SD of the controls in terms of overall accuracy, proportion of hits (correct responses) , and accuracy on multiple-choice questions (Table 3) . Retrograde memory for landmarks For this test, we selected major public events that had occurred from 1987 to 2000 and those that had occurred from 2001 to 2012 during the period of her retrograde amnesia (see Appendix) . The stimuli comprised pictures of landscapes/ scenes and faces related to each event and the titles of each event. The pictures and titles were presented on a laptop com- puter (Ultrabook, NEC) one at a time. KW and the controls viewed the screen from a distance of approximately 50 cm. We asked her to describe the event related to the stimulus; the time limit for each item was 10 s. If the patient could recall at least two of five predefined keywords for each event, we Table 3.

The results were compared with those of the control group. We also analyzed differences in the results related to a 10-year period of retro- grade amnesia and those related to the period before this. KW could recall events that occurred before the period of her retrograde amnesia fairly well irrespective of stimulus type (Figure 2) . Her successful recall of landscapes/scenes was 86. 7% (controls 93. 3%; SD = 6. 8) , of faces was 93. 3% (controls 97. 0%; SD = 4. 4) , and of titles was 93. 3% (controls 75. 8%; SD = 9. 1) . In contrast, for the events during the period of her retrograde amnesia, her successful recall of landscapes/scenes was 20. 0% (controls 87. 0%; SD = 11. 4) , of faces was 86. 7% (controls 86. 1%; SD = 8. 7) , and of titles was 20. 0% (controls 78. 8%; SD = 9. 4) . Thus, she could barely recall events during the period of her retrograde amnesia by landscapes/scenes or titles, but she could recall them by related faces. Egocentric orientation for familiar and novel environments The patient had no difficulty moving through her environs, performing body turns, and directional processing. She could accurately reach for visual objects that were located in both the central and peripheral visual field. She could also remember the location of objects in egocentric space with a delay. These find- ings indicated that her spatial orientation was preserved. She had no difficulty recalling the route between two familiar locations, such as her house and the nearby train station, and could recall the directions accurately. In contrast, for egocentric orientation in novel environments, when she was asked to verbally give the directions from the front entrance to the rehabilitation room on the second floor, she was unsure about which direction she should turn when leav- ing the escalator on the second floor. A road map test of directional sense using the route of the adult version of the Porteus Maze Test (Porteus, 1978) was administered to assess language-related egocentric directional sense. The patient was instructed to imagine how to reach the goal from the starting point and to verbally explain the direction in which she would turn at each corner without rotating the map. She provided correct answers at all corners except one, which case Controls 100 ' tal 7. oo 0 . . .

OISHI ET AL. was immediately corrected by herself. These findings revealed that her verbal right and left orientation and language-related egocentric directional sense were well preserved. Allocentric orientation for familiar and novel environments We examined her allocentric orientation using the map- drawing tests in familiar and novel environments. She could draw a map of the area around her house and place neighbor- ing stores correctly. She also drew the floor plan of her house and the location of the furniture correctly (Figure 3a, b) . However, buildings that had moved during the period of her retrograde amnesia were drawn at their old locations, such as a municipal swimming pool that had been relocated 8 years earlier (Figure 3c) . For the novel environments, she was asked to draw the hospital floor plan and the route between two locations inside the hospital. She could not draw the coffee shop that she frequented and misplaced the front desk, examination room of the neurology department, and chairs in the waiting room on the floor plan. She could not draw the route from the escalator to the rehabilitation room, which she always used on outpatient visits. We examined her allocentric orientation in novel environ- ments using a route-learning test in the hospital. A route that she had never taken before was set in the hospital, which contained 13 turns and took approximately 10 min to com- plete (Figure 4a) . She was given a map of the route and walked the route twice with the guidance of the examiner when necessary. To assess her memory other than the route, we gave her the following list of errands that she should do on the way: buy a bottle of water from a vending machine, buy origami paper at the gift shop, and wash her hands in the restroom. On the third trial, she walked by herself and made a total of six mistakes at 13 corners, despite remembering the details of the errands. She went straight at the first corner when she should have turned right, made a left turn when she was supposed to go straight, and went straight four times when she should have turned left or right (Figure 4b) . She was often confused about which direction to turn at the corners. Her husband remembered all of the directions and errands correctly in all three trials. Discussion Our patient showed TD in the form of anterograde disorienta- tion only in novel environments after recovering from amnesia caused by limbic encephalitis. Her higher-level visual percep- tion, visuospatial recognition, and visual memory were well preserved and did not affect learning of topographical infor- mation. Neuropsychological and experimental investigations revealed a severe deficit of learning topographical information with substantially preserved ability to learn verbal, visual- facial, and visual-object information. These findings suggest that our patient has TD specific to novel environments due to learning impairment associated with topographic memory. She could recall public events that occurred during the period of her retrograde amnesia by face stimuli but not by scenes or event titles. Our patient had no difficulty in moving through her envir- ons, performing body turns, directional processing, or reach- ing for objects and was able to remember the location of objects in egocentric space. She also displayed preserved way- finding in familiar environments and had good performances for recognizing photos of familiar places and buildings, except those learned during the period of her retrograde amnesia. Thus, we assume that her anterograde disorientation could not be egocentric or allocentric disorientation in general. There are possibilities that her learning of new landscapes could be affected by poor perspective taking or spatial dys- function. However, her difficulty in learning novel landscapes Figure 3.

Her general visuospatial abilities and recognition of familiar landscapes were well preserved. These findings indi- cated that anterograde disorientation was not simply asso- ciated with the poor perspective taking of landscapes or spatial dysfunction, although further assessments to clarify the detailed mechanism are warranted. Considering her nor- mal performance on the visual-faces and visual-objects tasks, her deficits cannot be attributed to visual memory impairment but rather to memory deficits specific to topographic informa- tion. Therefore, we consider this case as pure anterograde disorientation, as proposed by Aguirre and D Esposito (1999) . In the 10 previous cases of anterograde disorientation, the qualitative characteristics of anterograde disorientation were not clearly defined because systematic examinations for both landmark recognition and egocentric or allocentric disorienta- tion were not performed. Five patients seemed to exhibit allocentric disorientation with landmark agnosia (Epstein et al. , 2001; Habib & Sirigu, 1987; Takahashi & Kawamura, 2002; Turriziani et al. 2003) and three patients seemed to have allocentric disorientation without landmark agnosia (Habib & Sirigu, 1987; Katayama et al. , 1999; Sato et al. , 2004) (Table 4) . Patients from two cases reported by Ross (1980) exhibited severe allocentric disorientation, but there was no description of landmark agnosia. Except for the cases reported by Takahashi et al. (2002) , all patients with anterograde disorientation had visual memory deficits, which might affect the learning of new places and routes (Table 4) . The tests used to evaluate recognition of streetscapes and route-learning as well as the qualitative characteristics of TD varied among the studies. The present case and patient 1 in the study by Takahashi and Kawamura (2002) demonstrated landmark agnosia in the novel environ- ments without anterograde amnesia for visual information; however, the route-learning skills in novel environments or detailed memory, other than that tested by the Benton Visual Reproduction test, were not assessed in Takahashi s case. Turriziani et al. (2003) reported the case of a patient who showed severe deficits in spatial learning in the absence of persistent impairments in recognizing and memorizing faces or learning verbal and visual-object information; however, the patient had a mild global amnesic syndrome. In contrast, our patient showed no anterograde memory deficits except for landscapes on detailed examinations, and her performance in face and object learning was satisfactory. In the previously reported cases of anterograde disorienta- tion, the lesion site was generally in the inferior ventral areas of the right or bilateral occipitotemporal lobes and typically involved the parahippocampal gyrus. Neurofunctional ima- ging studies and clinical studies suggest involvement of the hippocampal gyrus (Ghaem et al. , 1997) and parahippocampal gyrus (Aguirre & D 'Esposito, 1999; Epstein et al. , 2001; Maguire et al. , 1997) in topographic memory. The non-human animal literature identified spatial view cells in the parahippocampal gyrus that respond when a monkey looks at a particular part of the environment O Keefe & Nadel, 1978) . Another study emphasized the importance of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex that support map-like spatial codes, in conjunction with frontal lobe mechanisms for planning routes during navigation (Epstein, Patai, Julian, & Spiers, 2017) . The lesions in our patient are located in the bilateral medial temporal regions, including both the hippocampal and the parahippocampal gyri, which would be an important hub for a network of topographical learning and memory. Some patients with anterograde disorientation showed impairment of face recognition (Table 4) . In the study by Ross (1980) , case 1 had profound prosopagnosia, whereas case 2 had difficulty in recognizing people he had met within the last few years. In the study by Habib and Sirigu (1987) , Table 4. Cases with anterograde topographical disorientation. both cases 1 and 2 had impaired face recognition. As in case 1, identification of faces was performed normally, although with abnormal latency, and case 2 showed difficulties in learning new faces. In the study by Epstein et al. (2001) , both cases 1 and 2 had prosopagnosia and impaired face memory. On the contrary, recent studies of the neuropsychology of human recognition memory have indicated material-specific memory impairments, such as faces versus scenes (Bird et al. , 2008; Carlesimo, Fadda, Turriziani, Tomaiuolo, & Caltagirone, 2001; Cipolotti et al. , 2006; Cipolotti, Robinson, Blair, & Frith, 1999; Maguire & Cipolotti, 1998; Smith, Jeneson, Frascino, & Kirwan, 2014) . Our patient demon- strated landscape-specific memory impairment, as she could recall public events in the period of her retrograde amnesia by face stimuli but not by scenes. A study on amnesic patients with lesions in the medial temporal lobe revealed that lesions in a wide area of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, impaired memory for faces and landscapes, whereas lesions limited to the hippocampus affected memory for landscapes only (Taylor, Henson, & Graham, 2007) . Together with pre- vious evidence documenting the importance of the hippo- campal and parahippocampal cortices and material-specific memory impairments in these areas, our findings suggest that the neural circuits involved in topographical memory are distinct from those involved in face memory. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive assessment of visual memory, visuospatial cognition, and cate- gory specificity of anterograde and retrograde memory and the first case of a patient with pure anterograde disorientation. Our case demonstrated amnesia specific to topographical information with spared memory for faces in both antero- grade and retrograde memory.

While the parahippocampal gyrus is related to landmark memoriza- tion and is important in learning directions, it is also consid- ered to play an important role in a series of processes related to memory recall. If these regions are disturbed, not only memorization but also the ability to recall in both anterograde and retrograde memory would be impaired. The limitations of our study include difficulty in determin- ing the exact extent of the lesion because our patient had bilateral lesions in the medial temporal lobes due to limbic encephalitis, it was difficult to determine. However, it appears that damage to bilateral hippocampal and/or parahippocam- pal gyri may lead to memory deficits specific to topographical information. Further studies with more sophisticated desktop tasks and route-learning tests should be performed to mea- sure spatial navigation, orientation, and related functions. Our case with pure anterograde disorientation might con- tribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms respon- sible for human topographical orientation, suggesting that the neural circuits involved in topographical scene memory are distinct from those involved in face recognition.

        "other": "Katayama et al. , 1999; Sato et al. , 2004) . Others had both navigation problems and poor recognition of photos of unfamiliar places and buildings. However, egocentric or allo- centric disorientation and landmark agnosia for novel environ- ments have not been thoroughly examined in these cases. Additionally, the exact mechanism of anterograde disorienta- tion remains unclear because most patients exhibited impaired visual memory not confined to topographical infor- mation. Anterograde disorientation seems to be associated with damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Many neurofunctional imaging studies have shown that topographic memory is associated with the hippocampal gyrus (Ghaem et al. , 1997) and parahippocampal gyrus (Aguirrie & D Esposito, 1999; Epstein et al. , 2001; Maguire, Frackowiak, & Frith, 1997) . A meta-analysis of functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that different neural correlates are involved in recalling a familiar or novel 2 Y. OISHI ET AL. environment and that different networks of regions subtend egocentric and allocentric orientation (Boccia, Nemmi, & Guariglia, 2014) . A study investigating cognition of streets- capes in novel environments reported that the parahippocam- pal gyrus activity was higher when subjects looked at buildings and landscapes than when they looked at faces and daily necessities (Epstein & Kanwisher, 1998) . Particularly, the posterior region of the parahippocampal gyrus is thought to be essential for the acquisition of novel environmental information (Epstein & Kanwisher, 1998; Nakamura et al. , 2000) . Contrastingly, mental navigation activates the hippo- campus, precuneus, and insula more strongly than visual (Rolls, Rovertoson, & Georges-Francois, 1997) . The authors suggested that a population of these cells might be used to encode the location of particular objects in space or to build representations of exocentric location within a detailed environment. Since place cells were discovered in 8 ) Y. OISHI ET AL. the rodent hippocampus by O Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) and the cognitive-map theory was subsequently formulated (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978) , the putative spatial navigation system in the hippocampus has been actively investigated. Electrophysiological research in rodents suggests that cogni- tive maps are neutrally instantiated by place cells, head direc- tion cells (Taube, Muller, & Ranck, 1990; Ranck, 1985) , grid cells (Fyhn, Hafting, Treves, Moser, & Moser, 2007; Fyhn, Molden, Witter, Moser, & Moser, 2004; Hafting, Fyhn, Molden, Moser, & Moser, 2005) , and border cells (Sharp, 1997; Sharp & Green, 1994; Stewart, Jeewajee, Wills, Burgess, & Lever, 2014) in the hippocampal formation and related structures. Recent research in humans indicates that navigation ability is supported by a network of brain regions, including the prefron- tal, parietal, striatal, and medial temporal regions (laria, Chen, Guariglia, Ptito, & Petrides, 2007; Maguire et al. , 1998; Ohnishi, Matsuda, Hirakata, & Ugawa, 2007) . In terms of regions contribut- ing to a specific strategy, response learning is largely associated with the caudate nucleus and place learning tends to rely on hippocampal circuits (de Bruin, Swinkels, & de Brabander, 1997; Hartley, Maguire, Spiers, & Burgess, 2003; laria, Petrides, Dagher, Pike, & Bohbot, 2003; & Shallice, T.

We report the case of a patient with severe semantic knowledge impairment and anterograde amnesia after bilateral ischemic lesion of the fornix and of the basal forebrain following surgical clipping of an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed a temporal hypometabolism.

Email: marco. solca@epfi. ch 2014 Taylor & Francis nonliving categories appears to be the most frequent cate- gory-specific semantic deficit with relatively well-preserved knowledge of nonliving but severe alteration for living knowledge (Gainotti, 2006) . Impairments of semantic mem- ory with selective deficit for animals concern anterior tem- poral lobe (Capitani et al. , 2009; Gainotti, 2000) . The fornix is a component of the Papez circuit (Papez, 1937) playing a key role in the formation and consolida- tion of memories. Bilateral fornix lesion is associated with anterograde episodic memory deficits with preserved retro- grade memory (Adamovich, Gualberto, Roberts, Haut, & Gutmann, 2009; Calabrese, Markowitsch, Harders, Scholz, & Gehlen, 1995; Hattingen et al. , 2007; Hodges & Carpenter, 1991; Moudgil, Azzouz, Al-Azzaz, Haut, & Gutmann, 2000; Park, Hahn, Kim, Na, & Huh, 2000) . However, fornix lesions have been implicated with retro- grade memory (Yasuno et al. , 1999) and with both ante- rograde and retrograde memory impairments (Korematsu, Hori, Morioka, & Kuratsu, 2010; Ruggeri & Sabatini, 2008; Wang, Peach, Xu, Schneck, & Manry, 2000) but always with preserved semantic memory. Anterior communicating artery aneurysm survivors often display anterograde amnesia related to basal fore- brain damage (Myers, Deluca, Hopkins, & Gluck, 2006) . The diagonal band of Broca and the medial septum are the two structures of the basal forebrain frequently associated with amnesic syndrome providing cholinergic innervations to critical memory structures (Morris, Bowers, Chatterjee, & Heilman, 1992; von Cramon, Markowitsch, & Schuri, 1993) . To our knowledge, such lesions have never been associated with semantic memory impairment. In this article, we describe a patient with severe seman- tic memory impairment in the context of a bilateral fornix Downloaded by [New York University] at 11: 32 11 June 2015 Neurocase 199 and basal forebrain damage. We performed detailed neu- ropsychological evaluations 6 weeks and 2 months after stroke that suggest that (a) the semantic disorder was task and modality independent with disproportionate impair- ment for the living category compared with the nonliving category and that (b) the patient presented anterograde amnesia for verbal and visual material. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and fluorodeoxyglu- cose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to assess anatomical correlates of this clinical presentation. Materials and methods Patient report M. T. was a 54-year-old right-handed woman, graduated in economics with an unremarkable medical history. She was admitted to the Geneva University Hospitals for atypical headache. An MRI scan revealed an unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm for which she underwent surgical elective clipping using right peritoneal craniotomy complicated by perioperative 800 cc blood loss with satis- factory management. Postoperatively, M. T. was initially confused but no motor or sensitive deficits were present. After 10 days, confusion resolved and M. T. was trans- ferred to neurorehabilitation. Neuropsychological assessment General neuropsychological evaluation Results of the neuropsychological examination at 6 weeks after surgical intervention are summarized in Table 1. M. T. was well oriented and cooperative. Spontaneous speech was fluent, grammatical with discrete naming difficulties that did not interfere with day-to-day conversation. Reading, repetition, writing, calculation, and praxic abilities were intact, as well as visuospatial skills as indicated by her good performance in copying and visual recognition (Figure 1 (A) and (B) ) . Retrograde memory was normal both regarding personal semantic and autobiographical memory. Anterograde memory performance showed barely normal learning but a severe deficit in maintaining verbal and visuospatial information. M. T. had also a discrete def- icit of working memory. Evaluation of executive functions showed average scores in a screening battery and in pho- nological and figural fluencies. By contrast, her perfor- mance was severely impaired in animal fluency, in confrontation naming and naming on definition, and her oral and written comprehension were largely influenced by semantic proximity (see section Semantic assessment ) . In summary, M. T. showed severe anomia and compre- hension deficit in the context of fluent speech, and pre- served day-to-day oral comprehension. She also showed episodic memory deficits for visuospatial and verbal mate- rial, as well as discrete verbal working memory Table 1. Results of neuropsychological assessment.

In contrast, phonology, syntax visuospatial abilities, and retrograde memory were preserved. Semantic assessment As shown in Table 2, the patient showed severe anomia and impaired within-category oral comprehension as mea- sured by the word-to-picture matching task (Cambridge Semantic Battery (Bozeat, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, Garrard, & Hodges, 2000) ) . Performance in these tasks was significantly worse on the living than nonliving items (naming: X2 (1) = 7. 75, P <_ . 05; comprehension: X2 (1) = 3. 92, P < . 05) .

She made additional much less frequent errors of omission (absence of response, 2/27, 7. 4%) , circumlocution (description of the target without naming, 2/27, 7. 4%) , visual (response visually similar to the target, 3/27, 11%) , and verbal Downloaded by [New York University] at 11: 32 11 June 2015 Neurocase 201 (production of a word that does not share any semantic relation with the target, 1/27, 3. 7%) . Most semantic errors were coordinate errors (e. g. rhinoceros > elephant) (14/19, 74%) . M. T. also produced responses that were of the same superordinate category as the target but not a coordinate (kangaroo wild animal cat domestic animal) (3/19, 16%) and superordinate errors (eagle bird) (2/19, 11%) . We compared the consistency of the items passed and failed across the naming and word-to-picture matching tasks. Among 38/128 errors produced in both tasks, 13/127 (10%) were consistent between tasks, and 15/128 (12%) were not. This suggests that the items that failed in one task were not systematically the same in the other task. Her performance was also severely deficient in verbal and nonverbal associative knowledge tasks (word/picture from the BECS GRECO, the Batterie d valuation des connaissances s mantiques du groupe de r flexion sur les valuations cognitives ) (Merck et al. , 2011) , where a target word/picture had to be matched with another one from two. For example, she matched a turtle with an acorn (and not with the target salad ) . In the nonverbal visual modality, the patient s perfor- mance was equally impaired. When requested to decide whether a drawing was real or not as previously proposed by Barbarotto, Laiacona, Macchi, and Capitani (2002) (contrasting natural categories animal, fruits and vege- tables, and body parts from artifacts tools, vehicles, furniture, and musical instruments) , she performed poorly but with no dissociation between living and nonliving items (X2 (1) = . 249, ns) . Within the living category, per- formance was inferior for animals (4/10) than for body parts (10/10) , fruits (9/10) , and vegetables (10/10) . To examine specific knowledge about animals, we devised a series of chimeric animal pictures. There were 70 photographs, half representing real and half unreal animals (http: //scifimafia. com; _http: //blogs. rpn. ch/chi- meres; http: //flickr. com, Figure 1 (E) ) from two categories (domestic and foreign) . The patient had difficulty to dis- criminate between real and unreal animals, with a clear tendency to consider nonexisting animals as real. As a further assessment of object recognition, we also adminis- tered a test of identity matching (BECS-GRECO (Merck et al. , 2011) ) measuring the ability to classify two visually different forms of an object as the same object, ability known to be vulnerable to semantic impairment (Ikeda, Patterson, Graham, Lambon Ralph, & Hodges, 2006) . In this task, M. T. s performance was inferior to controls. In contrast to preserved immediate copy (Figure 1 (B) ) , draw- ing from memory was strikingly impaired (Figure 1 (C) ) . Most of the patient s drawings were not identifiable (e. g. similar drawing for a cat and a rabbit) , and she made semantic confusions (e. g. a hen with four legs) . For living items, M. T. produced 5/18 (28%) identifiable drawings, a performance that was significantly inferior from nonliving items where 11/18 (61%; X2 (1) = 4. 05, P = . 04) . This severe impairment was also present when M. T. attempted to complete partial picture (Figure 1 (D) ) . Semantic knowledge in the auditory modality was not better than in the visual verbal and nonverbal modalities. When asked to match a living (human, animal) and non- living (vehicle, household object) sound with the corre- sponding target picture from an array of four pictures (Zimmermann, 2006) , her performance was_ severely altered but there was no dissociation between living and nonliving sounds. Imaging Structural MRI Brain MRI was performed 2 weeks after surgery on a 3. 0 T unit (Siemens Treo, Erlangen, Germany) . Figure 2 (A) and (B) shows gadolinium enhancement corresponding to bilateral acute ischemic lesions of the anterior columns of the fornix and the anterior commissure predominating on the right side. Figure 2 (C) and (D) shows post-surgery clipping artifact (black arrows) and gadolinium enhance- ment in front of the rostrum of corpus callosum corre- sponding to basal forebrain lesions (white arrows) . No atrophy of the cerebral cortex or other signs of degenera- tive process were present. FDG-PET Integrated PET/CT was performed after 6 weeks. It was acquired 30 minutes after iv injection of 260 MBq of F-18 FDG on a Biograph Sensation 16 hybrid scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) following CT without con- trast enhancement (2 mm slices) for anatomical co-regis- tration, attenuation, and scatter correction. As Figure 2 (E) and (F) shows, the patient had bilateral hypometabolism of frontomesial, temporomesial and temporopolar areas pre- dominating in the right hemisphere. Course Over the following weeks, the semantic impairment slowly improved. A second assessment 2 weeks after the first one using the 64-item naming task and the category comprehension task from the Cambridge Semantic Battery (Bozeat et al. , 2000) showed a significant improvement (naming task session 2: 54/64 (84%) , X2 (1) =. 10. 98, P < . 001; comprehension task session 2: 56/64 (88%) , X2 (1) = 4. 02, P < . 05) . Naming errors were still primarily of the semantic type (7/9, 70%) , but M. T. also produced omissions (2/9, 7. 4%) . Semantic errors were essentially coordinate errors (5/7, 71% vs. semantic non-coordinate 2/7, 29%) . Downloaded by [New York University] at 11: 32 11 June 2015 202 M. Solca et al.

Discussion After surgery of an aneurysm of the anterior communicat- ing artery, this patient showed severe semantic and ante- rograde episodic memory impairment that slightly resolved after 2 weeks. A bilateral lesion of the fornix and of the basal forebrain was associated with this clinical picture. These lesions typically induce anterograde episo- dic and more scarcely retrograde memory deficits, while semantic memory dysfunction has to our knowledge never been reported. Before surgery, the patient was totally independent and her family reported no memory dysfunction. After surgery, the most evident dysfunction was her severe difficulty during naming, comprehension, identification, and recog- nition tasks. Even though not aphasic, the patient had severe anomia where she produced coordinate responses (lion > tiger) . She also failed in comprehension tasks where semantic proximity of the distractors largely influ- enced her performance. In all tasks, she had more difficul- ties to name and understand items in the living categories. Performance was highly consistent across verbal and non- verbal modalities (e. g. word vs. picture associative task) , but the patient did not consistently fail the same items across different tasks. This is compatible with semantic access being influenced by contextual information, precise task requirements, and the richness or redundancy of the provided information (Bisiach, 1966) , which varied among the tasks used in the present study. The observation also supports the idea that our patient s difficulties reflected a problem of access to rather than erasure of stored semantic representations, as may be observed in semantic dementia (Warrington & Cipolotti, 1996) Downloaded by [New York University] at 11: 32 11 June 2015 Neurocase 203 Studies of the neural organization of semantic cogni- tion in patients with stroke aphasia, semantic dementia, and in normal participants implicate a large network of brain regions that include the bilateral anterior temporal cortex, the left posterior temporal/inferior parietal cortex, and the left lateral prefrontal cortex. In stroke, semantic impairment has been described after left inferior frontal gyrus or temporoparietal damage (Noonan et al. , 2010) . Our patient had no lesion in these areas. Degenerative pathology, for example, semantic dementia, can be ruled out for the following reasons: first, over 2 weeks, the patient presented significant improvement. Second, she had no atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, which would normally be visible in semantic dementia (Mummercy et al. , 2000; Patterson et al. , 2007) . Analysis of our patient s MRI did not reveal any damage to the anterior temporal lobes. In sum, our patient symptomatology was neither explainable by the locus of the brain damage nor by a degenerative process. However, functional imagery using FDG-PET revealed bilateral hypometabolism of the mesial part of the frontal lobe, and the mesial and polar aspects of the temporal lobe, a finding resembling the typical tem- poral hypometabolism observed in semantic dementia (Seltman & Matthews, 2012) . Lesions of the fornix or of the basal forebrain can disconnect critical memory structures in the medial tem- poral lobe, resulting in a reduction of the neuronal activity. This phenomenon is known as diaschisis, a condition in which an initial lesion provoked an inhibi- tion of function in a remote but anatomically connected intact brain area (Feeney & Baron, 1986) . Medial tem- poral hypometabolism following lesion of diagonal band of Broca have already been reported in a patient with anterograde amnesia (Abe, Inokawa, Kashiwagi, & Yanagihara, 1998) . The diagonal band of Broca and the medial septal nucleus are two basal forebrain regions that contribute to memory function by providing cholinergic input to dis- tributed cortical areas, including the temporal lobe (von Cramon et al. , 1993) . A cholinergic deficit has also been held accountable for the manifestations of Alzheimer s disease (Bartus and Dean, 2009) , which include semantic memory impairments (Chertkow & Bub, 1990; Hodges, Salmon, & Butters, 1992; Patterson et al. , 2007) . It is likely that the cognitive failures emanating from choliner- gic deficit vary depending on the brain region discon- nected from cholinergic input; deficits are presumably different in wide-spread (Alzheimer s disease) as opposed to focal disconnection. We surmise that M. T. s semantic impairment resulted from circumscribed interruption of pathways between the diagonal band or medial septal nuclei and the anterior temporal cortex, depriving this critical semantic structure of cholinergic innervation.

Keywords: semantic knowledge; diaschisis; diagonal band of Broca; medial septal nucleus In 1972 Tulving (1972) proposed a distinction between two forms of long-term declarative memory: the episodic and the semantic memories. Episodic memory refers to the ability to remember personal events that happened in a particular time and place. Semantic memory contains gen- eral world knowledge about the world, concepts, objects, and the meanings of words, culturally dependent and independent of place and time. Neuropsychological evi- dence suggests a double dissociation between episodic and semantic memory: patients may have selective impairment in semantic memory with preserved episodic memory (De Renzi, Liotti, & Nichelli, 1987; Grossi, Trojano, Grasso, & Orsini, 1988) and vice versa (Calabrese et al. , 1996; O Connor, Butters, Miliotis, Eslinger, & Cermak, 1992) . Semantic memory impairment is typically associated with lesions of the anterior temporal, inferior frontal, or tem- poroparietal areas (Noonan, Jefferies, Corbett, & Lambon Ralph, 2010; Patterson, Nestor, & Rogers, 2007) while medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex lesions lead to episodic memory deficits (Ferbinteanu, Kennedy, & Shapiro, 2006; Lech & Suchan, 2013) . Given that anterior temporal cortex damage is frequently associated with semantic memory impairment, it has been proposed that semantic memory involves widely distributed modality- specific regions connected to an amodal hub located in the anterior temporal lobe (Patterson et al. , 2007) .

Since the MTT is small and adjacent to several important struc- tures for memory, amnesia associated with isolated MTT infarction has been rarely reported. We report a patient who developed amnesia following an infarction of the left MTT that spared adjacent memory-related structures including the anterior tha- lamic nucleus. The patient's memory deficit was characterized by a severe antero- grade encoding deficit and retrograde amnesia with a temporal gradient. In con- trast, he did not show either frontal executive dysfunction or personality change that is frequently recognized in the anterior or medial thalamic lesion. We postu- late that an amnesic syndrome can develop following discrete lesions of the MTT. Key Words : Amnesia; Cerebral Infarction; Mammillothalamic Tract INTRODUCTION The mammillothalamic tract (MTT) , connecting the mam- millary body (MB) with the anterior thalamic nucleus, is a part of the Papez circuit. Therefore, disruption of the MTT would be predicted to cause a memory disturbance (1) . How- ever, memory deficits following an MTT lesion have not been clearly characterized, since MTT is a small structure, rarely being involved selectively. Recently, a couple of case reports described patients with acute onset amnesia after either unilateral or bilateral MTT infarction (2, 3) . However, a subsequent study demonstrated that memory impairment did not develop after electrode im- plantation in bilateral MB and MTT for refractory epilepsy. Investigators suggested that the memory impairment after MTT infarctions in previous reports could have been attributed to extension of lesions into the anterior thalamic nucleus (4) . We report a patient who showed profound and persistent global amnesia after a unilateral lesion of MTT that spared the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus. 1094 Key-Chung Park, Sung-Sang Yoon, Dae-il Chang, Kyung-Cheon Chung, Tae-Beom Ahn, Bon D.

CASE REPORT A 70-yr-old right-handed man with nine years of education developed sudden memory loss three days before admission to Kyung Hee University Hospital. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension for three years and two episodes of stroke. The first episode of stroke developed 11 yr earlier when he was admitted because of transient confusion. About 40 days prior to admission, he was admitted to another hos- pital for evaluation of dizziness. Despite the absence of focal neurological or cognitive deficits at this time, diffusion-weight- ed (DWI) and T2-weighted images (T2WI) showed an acute infarction in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The scan also identified an old infarct in the left lingual gyrus, as well as another slit-like lesion in the right anterior thalamus on T2WI with signal characteristics consistent with a previous thal mic hemorrhage (Fig. 1) . Three days before admission, his family suddenly noticed him asking the same questions repeatedly. On the forth day after onset (the second hospital day) , the patient was alert and cooperative but recalled none of the previous day's events and failed to recognize the attending physician who had been la- Amnesia in Mammillothalamic Tract Infarction 1095 Fig. 1.

Axial FLAIR (A) , coronal (B) , and sagittal (C) T2-weighted images from the current amnesic stroke show a new infarction in the left thalamic area (arrowhead) in addition to the old left lingual gyrus and right anterior thalamic (arrow) lesions.

The patient left MTT according to an atlas (Fig. 2) (5) . T2WI and fluid 1096 attenuated inversion recovery imaging obtained three days later showed the MTT lesion with no additional lesions except the aforementioned lesions (Fig. 1) . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed on the same day showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the right cerebellar hemisphere and the left occipital lobe, but no flow reduction in other cortical regions. Detailed neuropsychological tests using a standardized bat- tery called Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (6) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were performed four days after onset. His verbal and performance IQ were 92 and 93 with a full-scale IQ of 92, consistent with expected premor- bid function. Forward digit span was 6 (64th percentile) . His performances on spoken and written language were normal as were on 10 items of praxis and on tasks for Gerstmann syn- drome. However, the patient had impaired confrontation nam- ing as assessed by the Korean version of the Boston Naming Test (29/60, Ist percentile) . Copying ability tested with the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure was intact (30/36, 32nd per- centile) , but immediate recall (7. 5/36, 12th percentile) , 20- min delayed recall (10/36, 17th percentile) , and recognition ability (true positive-false positive=3-2, <1 percentile) were impaired. Verbal memory as assessed by the Seoul Verbal Learning test was also impaired, showing defective new learn- ing (3-trial immediate free recall: 8/36, 1st percentile) , delayed recall (0/12, <1 percentile) , and recognition (1/12, <1 per- centile) . Frontal/executive functions including go-no-go test, controlled oral word association, motor set shifting, and Stroop color test (101/112, 72nd percentile) were intact.

To further substantiate his retrograde amnesia, we performed which showed that his retrograde amnesia was limited almost exclusively to the events during the past one year. A repeat evaluation using the same neuropsychological tests four months after onset showed persistent amnesia. He could not even remember his mother s death two months previously. DISCUSSION Despite recurrent episodes of stroke, our patient had expe- rienced no previous cognitive changes except for a transient episode of mental confusion until being admitted. Therefore, although the patient had lesions in the left lingual gyrus, the right cerebellar hemisphere, and the right anterior tha- lamus, it is difficult to explain the patient's acute profound amnesia by these lesions. Rather, the acute infarction in the K. -C. Park, S. -S. Yoon, D. -I. Chang, et al. left MTT confirmed by DWI have caused severe amnesia by disconnecting the MB and the anterior thalamic nucleus. To date, there have been two case reports that specifically documented memory dysfunction following MTT infarction. Yoneoka and colleagues recently reported a patient with Kor- sakoff syndrome associated with ischemic injury in the left MTT (3) . However, this case may differ from our case in that the lesion of the patient involved left anterior thalamus in addi- tion to MTT, while the lesion in our patient selectively dam- aged MTT. This involvement of the anterior thalamus may be associated with the patient s behavioral and cognitive deficits in addition to amnesia; that is, although details of cognitive assessment were not provided, the authors described their pa- tient as disoriented in time and demonstrating both antero- grade and retrograde amnesia. In addition, he exhibited min- imal insight into cognitive dysfunction, confabulated and ex- hibited poor concentration. It has been reported that these neu- ropsychological and neurobehavioral abnormalities are frequ- ently observed from an anterior thalamic lesion (7) . In contrast, Schott and associates reported a patient with amnesic syndrome due to an unequivocally isolated left MTT infarct (2) . Detailed testing showed selective episodic memo- ry impairment limited to verbal material with preservation of visual memory. Our patient with a left MTT lesion, how- ever, showed both verbal and visual memory loss. It has been known that verbal memory loss is more often associated with disruption of memory circuits in the left (dominant) than in the right hemisphere, whereas the opposite is true with visu- al memory loss (2) . Thus, the memory loss in our patient, is not compatible with this hypothesis, although the hemisphere- specific memory loss in thalamic injury is reported to be incon- sistent (8) . The visual memory loss in our patient may be at- tributed to the old right thalamic lesion. In the same context, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that our patient's subclinical lesion involving the right thalamus might have contributed to the emergence of amnesia after the left MTT infarction. As in our case, the patient described by Schott et al. did not show confabulation and retained insight of cognitive dysfunction. Dysnomia was present, albeit not being as severe as in our patient. Results of executive tests were not mentioned. Retrograde memory difficulty, tested using a famous faces test, was established for name recall but not face recognition. A tecent study asserted that amnesia attributed to MTT injury may result from extension of lesions into adjacent struc- tures (4) . Indeed, the MTT is a minute fiber bundle coursing in close proximity to other memory-related structures such as the fornix, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway, the anteri- or and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, and the internal medullary lamina. Furthermore, the MTT shares a common vascular sup- ply with these structures via the tuberothalamic artery. Thus, even small ischemic lesions of the thalamus can variably involve multiple nuclei and their projections, resulting in heteroge- neous patterns of diencephalic amnesia and accompanying ne- uropsychological deficits. As a result, understanding the con- Amnesia in Mammillothalamic Tract Infarction tribution of MTT lesions to amnesia has remained elusive. Such patients as those described in this report and by Schott et al. (2) provide the evidence of a critical role for the MTT in mediating episodic memory. Firstly, images from these two patients showed minimal dorsal and rostral extension, making injury to the anterior and the medial dorsal nuclei less like- ly. Secondly behavioral observations from the two cases indi- cate no executive dysfunction or confabulation often associat- ed with the injury to more anterior and dorsal thalamic nuclei (9) . Finally, radionuclide imaging in our case failed to detect reduced cerebral blood flow in the thalamus or the cortical projection zones of the anterior and the medial dorsal thala- mic nuclei. Prior brain SPECT demonstrated reduced blood flow in association with cortical regions following patholog- ical disconnection from more rostral and dorsal thalamic struc- tures (10) . Thus, findings from these two case studies are in line with a recent magnetic resonance imaging-based lesion overlap study of thalamic infarctions, which found that MTT involvement correlates highly with severe memory deficits (1) . To our knowledge, few patients with an isolated MTT injury underwent detailed neuropsychological tests including frontal functions. Other than anomia, the only neuropsychological deficit in our patient was memory dysfunction characterized by severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia with a tempo- ral gradient. Markedly low scores in both delayed recall and recognition suggest that anterograde amnesia was associated with encoding and storage problems rather than retrieval de- ficit. These findings suggest that the features of amnesia from MTT damage resemble those associated with medial tempo- ral damage, but differ from those following anterior thalam- ic lesions (7) . 1097 REFERENCES 1.

A dense retrograde amnesia for personal events characterized the syndrome. Learning of new verbal information was spared, while learning of visual material remained persistently poor. The data confirm previous clinical and activation studies suggesting a specific role of the retrosplenial areas in retrieval processes. The hypothesis is that retrieval of autobiographical events may take advantage of visual imagery and that the retrosplenial cortex may play a specific role in human memory by acting as an interface between memory retrieval and visuospatial processes. introduction A clear discrepancy exists in the neuropsychological litera- ture between the extreme paucity of anatomical-clinical reports showing a relationship between retrosplenial lesions and memory disorders and the relative richness of PET studies pointing to involvement of the retrosplenial cortex in memory functions. . Although Ironside and Guttmacher (1929) had already stressed the importance of memory disorders in patients with splienial tumours in 1929, it was only in 1987 that Valenstein et al, described a case of retrosplenial amnesia , ie. of anterograde and retrograde amnesia in a patient showing a lesion of the splenium and of a region containing the retrosplenial cortex and the cingulate bundle. These authors offered an elegant anatomical explanation of retro- splenial amnesia, stressing the role played by the cingulate bundle and the retrosplenial cortex within the Papez circuit (1937) . According to these authors, a lesion of the retro- splenial cortex interrupts a pathway that proceeds to the posterior part of the cingulate cortex from the anterior thalamic nuclei, before being channelled to the para- hippocampal gyrus/entorhinal cortex and, finally, to the hippocampus proper. In spite of the clinical and theoretical appeal of this anatomical model, no new anatomical-clinical report of retrosplenial amnesia has been published since Valenstein et al. s (1987) seminal paper. These authors proposed that their anatomical model could in part explain the amnesic syndrome shown by a patient previously described by Heilman and Sypert (1977) as a Korsakoff s syndrome resulting from bilateral fornix lesions. Furthermore, in more recent years, von Cramon et al. (1990) described a patient who had shown a transient verbal memory deficit after a small haemorrhage in the left retrosplenial area. However, evidence supporting a retrosplenial lesion in the case described by Heilman and Sypert (1977) is poor, as is the description of the amnesic syndrome shown by the patient reported by von Cramon et al. (1990) . Rudge and Warrington (1991) also discussed the possible contribution of the retrosplenial cortex in memory disorders of patients with splenial tumours. This study, however, was not a single case study, but an investigation of recognition memory disorders in patients with lesions involving the retrosplenial cortex in which amnesia was interpreted as a result of a disconnection between the frontal and the temporal lobes due to damage to the fornix rather than to a lesion of the retrosplenial cortex itself. The body of empirical evidence pointing to an involve- ment of the retrosplenial cortex in memory functions is much richer, when we pass from the anatomical clinical reports to the PET activation studies. Thus, Grasby ef al. (1993) used the difference in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between a subspan and a supraspan task of verbal memory to identify brain areas involved in long-term auditory verbal memory. They observed an increase in rCBF in the prefrontal cortex, precuneus and retrosplenial areas of the cingulate gyrus. Andreasen et al. (1995) showed that activation of the medial frontal regions and of the precuneus/retrosplenial cingulate cortex was common Correspondence to: Guido Gainotti, Institute of during an autobiographical memory task, which consisted of listening to sentences containing information taken from the subject s past. To conclude, these data, as well as other experimental reports (Tulving et al, 1994) , converge in suggesting that the retrieval process produces activation of the retrosplenial/precuneus regions. The hypothesis sometimes advanced is that these regions may guarantee the successful retrieval of stored memories by relying on a visual imagery process (but see Buckner er al. , 1996) . The renewed interest raised by these PET studies in the role played by the retrosplenial cortex in memory functions {taken, as in Valenstein er al. s paper (1987) in a rather loose sense} led us to report here the case of a patient with a rather selective retrograde amnesia, resulting from a tumour involving the splenium of the corpus callosum, infiltrating bilaterally into the fornix and the retrosplenial cortex. Obviously, this case cannot be considered as a pure case of retrosplenial amnesia, since the tumour also involved the fornix bilaterally. However, some aspects of the patient s symptomatology suggest that the retrosplenial lesion probably added something to the amnesic syndrome that is usually observed in patients with a pure lesion of the fornix-hippocampus system. In particular, the impor- tance of the retrograde autobiographical memory loss shown by this patient is inconsistent with the prevalence of anterograde amnesia, characterizing the lesions of the fornix hippocampus system. On the basis of the pattern of memory deficit shown by our patient, we tried to examine the role of the retrosplenial cortex in retrieval processes (retrograde amnesia) and to speculate on a possible relation between visual imagery and autobiographical memory recall. Case report and clinical evolution AP, a 43-year-old woman who had previously been employed as a farm worker, suffered the sudden onset of mental confusion and paresthesia of the left upper limb in December 1994. On admission to the hospital of the small town where she lived, the patient was described as confused and deeply disoriented in time and in place. However, more informative than this generic description made by a non-neurologist physician is the fact that at the onset of the symptomatology, a severe retrograde amnesic syn- drome was also detected. AP s relatives reported that on admission she had no memory of at least 20 years of her life before the onset of the disease. For example, AP did not remember being married and having a 20-year-old son who was serving in the army. In contrast, she did not seem to have major problems in remembering ongoing events. The CT scan, performed within a few hours of the onset of the symptomatology, was negative. The EEG showed some diffuse theta slowing. In the following hour, AP s orientation improved, as well as her ability to remember facts of her past life. Paresthesia was no longer reported. A second CT scan, performed | week later, was negative. The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of transient global amnesia, but because of the atypical features of her symptomatology, a detailed neuropsycho- logical examination and a neurological control was requested. The patient was examined at our Neuro- psychological Service 1 month after the onset of the disease. She was oriented in time and in place. She com- plained of tiredness, difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration and occasional episodes of headache. A physical examination was negative. The neuropsychologi- cal examination showed a borderline performance in the delayed recall of Rey s 15 words and a severe deficit in reproducing Rey s complex figure from memory. Spon- taneous speech and comprehension were normal. The patient still complained of difficulty in recalling past life episodes, although to a lesser extent than at the onset. Because of the persisting memory defect, headache and slight mental confusion, AP was admitted to our depart- ment in January 1996. The CT scan performed at admis- sion was negative. The MRI scan performed 1 week later (Fig. 1) revealed a neoplastic lesion in the retrosplenial region (see detailed description below) . By means of stereo- tactic needle biopsy, the histological diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma was established. The tumour was considered not susceptible to surgical excision, radiation therapy or treatment with antitumour drugs. The patient was dis- charged with steroid therapy. Clinical and neuropsycho- logical controls were performed in March 1996 and April 1996 when, because of clear signs of increased intra- cranial pressure, the patient was again admitted to our Downloaded by [University of Cambridge] at 23: 41 28 December 2014 inp * ' i \" Retrograde amnesia and retrosplenial tumour 521 department. Although fluctuating, neuropsychological symptomatology did not significantly change until June 1996 when confusion and clouded consciousness became manifest. The patient died a few weeks later, shortly after the appearance of a left hemiparesis. Neuropsychological examination At the first neuropsychological examination, the patient was oriented in time and in place and co-operative, in spite of tiredness and frequent episodes of headache. No sign of aphasia was detected. Oral production was grammatical and lexically correct. AP was accurate in confrontation naming and lexical comprehension as well as in sentence comprehension tasks. Writing, reading and repetition were normal. She obtained normal scores on a verbal intelligence task (word fluency: adjusted score: 20; cut-off: 17. 35) . Visuospatial intelligence was normal as well (Raven s Coloured matrices: adjusted score: 29. 4; cut-off: 18. 96) . No deficit in visuospatial exploration emerged in a line cancel- lation task. Selective visual attention was normal as dem- onstrated by the good score obtained in Zazzo s test. She also obtained a normal score (18; cut-off: 17) in the fragmented letters task that requires the identification of a series of letters in which parts of the image have been randomly deleted (Warrington and James, 1991) . Oral, limb and constructional praxis were normal. No sign of callosal disconnection was detected. Her performance remained stable in subsequent follow-up studies except for some difficulty in maintaining sustained attention and concentration, mostly related to persistent headache. Examination of memory functions (first examination) Wechsler Memory Scale At the first examination, the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) showed mild memory impairment, with a total score of 34. 5 and a memory quotient of 66. Disproportion- ate difficulties were observed in some subsets such as logic memory, backward digit span, visual reproduction and associate learning for difficult pairs (Table 1a) . Episodic Memory (Table 2a) Anterograde memory: verbal learning, explored by means of Rey s Auditory Verbal Learning test, was within the nor- mal range (immediate recall: adjusted score: 33. 6; cut-off: 28. 53; delayed recall: adjusted score: 6. 3; cut-off: 4. 69) .

Non-verbal learning (reproduction of Rey Osterrieth s complex figure) was dramatically impaired (no element reproduced after 3 min) in spite of the normal accuracy shown in copying (adjusted score: 31; cut-off: 29. 34) . The patient also obtained pathological scores in a Picture Recognition test based on the immediate and delayed recognition of a series of meaningful figures previously presented (Gainotti et al. , 1989) (immediate recognition: adjusted score: 81, cut-off: 90. 47; delayed recognition: adjusted score: 57; cut-off: 91. 02) . Non-verbal span (Corsi s test) was pathological (obtained score: 4; cut-off: 5) . Retrograde memory (personal events) : the Autobiographi- cal Incident Schedule (Kopelman er al, 1989) (Italian translation) revealed a moderate impairment (obtained score: 15; cut-off for Italian version of the test: 22. 5) . A detailed analysis of the results obtained in the Autobio- graphical Incident Schedule (Table 3a) showed that the loss of memory mostly concerned more recent events (namely, the last 10 years of her life) , while more remote events were preserved to a large extent. When autobiographical memory was studied by means of the method proposed by Crovitz and Schiffmann (1974) (Italian adaptation by Ghidoni et al, 1995) , the patient showed clear difficulty in recalling episodes concerning the last 5 years of her life. In other words, she was able to recall a large number of episodes of her life, but the majority of them concerned her remote life (Table 3b) . In fact, whatever the stimulus word was, the patient generally referred to episodes of her remote life; for example she gave quite detailed descriptions of her childhood, of her parents and of her primary school peers. However, the vast majority of her memories referred to the period of her life between 20 and 30 years of age, more specifically to her wedding. For example, she was able to give a considerable amount of information about the emotions demonstrated by her best friend during the ceremony. Many details were also given about her sons childhood, for example the toys she bought for them, the holidays spent with them, a little home accident that occurred when her oldest child was 5 years old. In contrast, she generally did not evoke episodes from her more recent past and if she did, the descriptions were mostly generic and poor in details.

Con- versely, no improvement could be documented in learning of non-verbal material (see, for example, reproduction of Rey~Osterrieth s Complex Figure or WMS visual repro- duction subsets) . Similarly, no improvement was observed in WMS Logic Memory subset. After initial improvement in recalling recent events, retrograde amnesia, evaluated by means of the Autobiographical Incident Schedule (Kopelman er al, 1989) (Italian translation) remained unchanged. MRi data The MRI scan performed on February 1996 revealed a neoplastic lesion in the retrosplenial region of the brain also involving trigon, precallosal cisterns, the posterior part of both fornices and both hippocampi. A more extensive MRI study, performed in May 1996 (Fig. 1) , showed the neoplastic lesion in the retrosplenial region with a bilateral and symmetrical involvement of the posterior part of the fornices, extending down to the hippocampi; the bilateral and symmetrical involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum, of trigons and pericallosal cisterns was also confirmed. Discussion The main difference between the amnesic syndrome shown by AP and that usually shown by patients with circum- scribed lesions of the fornix-hippocampal system con- cerned the severity of retrograde amnesia for personal events of the last 10 years, initially shown by our patient, and the prevalence of retrograde amnesia over anterograde verbal memory impairments documented during the entire course of her disease. A second difference concerned the clear prevalence of visuospatial learning defects over verbal learning defects, while in patients with bilateral lesions of the hippocampal system, verbal and visual memory are usually equally affected. It is worth noting that our patient did not present major problems in visual perceptual analy- sis that could justify her deficit in learning visual material. In fact, her performance was good in cancellation tasks, in copying complex figures and in recognizing degraded letters. We should acknowledge, however, that although the MRI data showed a bilateral and symmetrical involvement of the posterior part of the fornix and of the retrosplenial cortex, the prevalence of the visuospatial over the verbal learning impairment may have been due to a greater involvement of the right hippocampal system, since a transient left-sided paresthesia had been observed at the onset of the patient s symptomatology and a left hemi- paresis became evident shortly before death. We therefore focused our attention on the prevalence of retrograde amnesia over the verbal learning defect as a possible marker of the role played by the retrosplenial cortex in memory functions as compared to the hippocampal system. It is well known that bilateral lesions of the hippocampal system typically produce severe anterograde amnesia and a much milder retrograde amnesia limited to autobiographi- cal memory shortly preceding the onset of amnesia. Squire and co-workers (1989) suggested that the hippocampal system organizes and consolidates memory traces, but that Downloaded by [University of Cambridge] at 23: 41 28 December 2014 524 G. Gainotti et al. these traces gradually become independent from the hippo- campus and dependent on neocortical storage sites. The severe retrograde amnesia shown by AP at the onset of her symptomatology and the dense amnesia documented by the Autobiographical Incident Schedule (Kopelman et al, 1989) over the last 10 years are not completely consistent with the bilateral involvement of the fornix hippocampus system, and suggest rather that her retrograde amnesia could be at least in part due to the concomitant retro- splenial lesions. Since the retrosplenial cortex is part of the neocortical network used to store old memories or to retrieve them, a lesion in this area should be expected in some patients with a relatively pure form of retrograde amnesia. The authors who have reported anatomical-clinical cases of patients with a pure form of retrograde amnesia have consistently stressed the integrity of hippocampus and para-hippocampal gyri, but have given a contrasting account of the brain structures typically impaired. Thus, Goldberg et ai. (1981) and Rousseaux er al. (1984) stressed the importance of brainstem and above all of mesen- cephalic lesions in their patients, whereas most authors (O Connor et al. , 1992; Markowitch et al. , 1993; Babinski et al. , 1994; Kapur et al, 1994) have claimed that the antero lateral temporal neocortex is selectively damaged in patients with pure focal retrograde amnesia. On the other hand, in at least three such patients reported by Ogden (1993) , Hunkin et al. (1995) and Lucchelli et al. (1995) , the lesions mainly involved the posterior cingulate gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex. The patient reported by Ogden (1993) had suffered 6 years before the examination for a closed head injury with bilateral medial occipital infarc- tions and cortical blindness. After recovery, he showed a complex symptomatology including both visual and memory disorders. The visual symptomatology included visual imagery impairment whereas the amnesic syndrome consisted of a severe retrograde autobiographical memory loss, with only mild impairment of new verbal learning. An MRI scan carried out 6 years after the accident showed a bilateral lesion of the medial aspects of both occipital lobes with more prominent involvement of the retrosplenial cortex on the right. The patient reported by Hunkin er al. (1995) had also suffered a closed head injury at the age of 19 years. At the time of the neuropsychological examin- ation, carried out 20 years after the accident, the patient showed a severe retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information, in the presence of a relatively mild antero- grade amnesia (more important for non-verbal material) . An MRI scan again showed a bilateral lesion of the medial surfaces of the occipital lobes with tissue damage also involving the retrosplenial cortex. Finally, the patient reported by Lucchelli et al. (1995) showed extensive retro- grade amnesia with a temporal gradient after a closed head trauma, which contrasted with complete integrity of anterograde memory. Although CT scan and MRI scan did not show evidence of structural brain damage, a PET scan demonstrated significant hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex bilaterally. Both Ogden (1993) and Hunkin ef al. (1995) considered the focal retrograde amnesia shown by their patients in reference to Damasio s model of the neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval Warrington (1991) reported nine patients with tumours involving the splenium of the corpus callo- sum and extending asymmetrically to the adjacent cortex of the right or of the left hemisphere. A severe memory impairment and disorder of visual perception, in the absence of other cognitive defects, were usually observed in these patients. Takahashi et al. (1997) recently described three patients with right retrosplenial lesions who presented a pure topographical disorientation (considered a memory disorder relating to the spatial relationships among build- ing and landscapes) as the outstanding feature of their cognitive impairment. As for the characteristics of the memory tasks that usually activate the retrosplenial cortex during PET studies, these tasks are mainly based on retrieval processes crucially involved in retrograde memory tasks. As already mentioned in the introduction, in activation studies also, some authors have stressed the importance that strategies based on visual imagery may have on tasks of memory retrieval. In Kapur et al. s study (1994) , it is postulated that the posterior regions are activated in the successful Downloaded by [University of Cambridge] at 23: 41 28 December 2014 retrieval of memories. Since the experiment utilized a visual paradigm, the authors concluded by admitting that the activation of these regions reflects a process of visual imagery that accompanies or facilitates the successful recovery of stored memories. Similarly, in Fletcher et ai. s study (1996) , when visual strategies have been used to enhance retrieval, a strong activation of the precuneus (ying just above the retrosplenial cortex) has been obtained. Overall, most clinical and activation studies are consist- ent with the hypothesis that the pattern of memory impair- ment shown by our patient, namely a retrograde amnesia for personal memories and a visuospatial learning defect, may reflect the specific role played by the retrosplenial cortex in memory functions. From this point of view, the prevalence of retrograde over anterograde amnesia and the prevalence of visuospatial over verbal learning defects could be explained by assuming that the retrosplenial cortex may act as an interface between memory retrieval and visuospatial processes. Disruption of this interface should, in fact, selectively affect two sorts of memory tasks: (a) those which are helped by strategies based on visual imagery, namely tasks of autobiographical memory retrieval; (b) those which are based on the integration between memory processes and visuospatial material, namely tasks of visuospatial learning. These conclusions are not at variance with the fact that AP obtained very poor scores also on a verbal test (the Logic Memory subset) of the WMS. This subset is in fact the only verbal test which can be significantly helped by a strategy based on visual imagery to improve the retrieval process.

C, Silveri Abstract We describe a patient who developed a pure amnesic syndrome due to anaplastic astrocytoma in the retrosplenial region. A dense retrograde amnesia for personal events characterized the syndrome. Learning of new verbal information was spared while learning of visual material remained persistently poor. The data confirm previous clinical and activation studies suggesting a specific role of the retrosplenial areas in retrieval processes. The hypothesis is that retrieval of autobiographical events may take advantage of visual imagery and that the retrosplenial cortex may play a specific role in human memory by acting as an interface between memory retrieval and visuospatial processes.

Gainotti et al. to both focused (recall of past experiences) and random (generation of free associations about past experiences) tasks of autobiographical memory. Fletcher et ai. (1995) studied separately the brain structures engaged during the processes of encoding and of retrieval of auditory verbal memory. Encoding of episodic memory was associated with activation of the left prefrontal cortex and of the retro- splenial cingulate cortex, whereas retrieval from episodic Memory was associated with activation of the precuneus (lying just above the retrosplenial areas) and of the right prefrontal cortex. In another study, Fletcher et al. (1996) investigated the influence of visual imagery and of semantic relatedness on brain activity during memory retrieval. They showed that the use of imagery during the retrieval process was associated with activation of a cortical region lying between the precuneus and the retrosplenial cortex. A specific role of retrosplenial/precuneus regions in the retrieval process was also postulated by Kapur et al. (1995) . According to these authors, while attempts to retrieve memories activate the right prefrontal cortex, ecphory, that is, the successful retrieval of memories, engages the pos- terior regions, probably reflecting the facilitatory effect on the retrieval process produced by visual imagery. Finally, Fink et al. (1996) observed functional activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (as well as in other regions) (Damasio, 1989) . According to Ogden (1993) , the retrograde amnesia shown by her patient was a consequence of the severe impoverishment of episodic memory that must occur when events originally stored in different regions of the brain as place and time-locked multimodal memories must be recalled without any visual component. In a similar manner, Hunkin et al. (1995) postulated that their patient s lesion might disrupt transmission of the information either to the conver- gence zones from visual imagery activity in the posterior cortex or to the posterior cortex from the convergence zones. All these papers (Ogden, 1993; Hunkin ef a/. , 1995; Lucchelli et al, 1995) more or less implicitly postulated that the posterior regions, thus including the retrosplenial cortex, intervene in memory retrieval, especially for per- sonal events, and suggest (Ogden, 1993; Hunkin er al. , 1995) the possible role of visual imagery in these types of memory processes. The hypothesis that the retrosplenial cortex plays a specific role in memory processes, by inte- grating visual information with operations of memory retrieval, may be advanced on the basis of two independent lines of research. The first refers to the results of two neuropsychological investigations conducted by Rudge and Warrington (1991) and by Takahashi et al (1997) in patients with lesions involving the retrosplenial cortex in a more or less extensive way. The second refers to the characteristics of memory tasks that usually provoke acti- vation of the retrosplenial cortex during PET studies in normal subjects. Rudge and ME, Miezin FM and Petersen SE.

Self trait knowledge, which is considered one of the more abstract types of autobiographical memory, is thought to rely on regions of the autobiographical memory neural network implicated in schema representation, including the ventromedial pre- frontal cortex, and critically, not the medial temporal lobes. The current case study in- troduces an individual who experienced bilateral posterior cerebral artery strokes resulting in extensive medial temporal lobe damage with sparing of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, in addition to severe retrograde and anterograde episodic and auto- biographical fact amnesia, this individual's self trait knowledge was impaired for his cur- rent and pre-morbid personality traits. Yet, further assessment revealed that this individual had preserved conceptual knowledge for personality traits, could reliably and accurately rate another person's traits, and could access his own self-concept in a variety of ways. In addition to autobiographical memory loss, he demonstrated impairment on non- personal semantic memory tests, most notably on tests requiring retrieval of unique knowledge. This rare case of amnesia suggests a previously unreported role for the medial temporal lobes in self trait knowledge, which we propose reflects the critical role of this * Corresponding author.

Additional evidence for single dissociations in neuropsychological data have been reported in three other cases of extensive unilateral or bilateral MTL damage, where self trait knowledge was intact in the face of impaired episodic memory and autobiographical facts (Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Klein et al. , 2002; Klein & Lax, 2010) . The apparent separation of self trait knowledge from the MTLs has persisted despite growing appreciation that other personal semantics depend on the MTLs (Grilli & Verfaellie, 2014; Renoult et al. , 2012) . For instance, we have shown that the retrieval of autobiographical facts attached to a spatiotem- poral context, which we have termed experience-near autobiographical facts, is compromised by MTL damage, whereas the retrieval of experience-far autobiographical facts that are devoid of such contexts does not depend on the MTL (Grilli & Verfaellie, 2016) . Though relevant case studies of self trait knowledge are few, these findings are also corroborated by numerous fMRI studies. Critically, relative to judging the personality traits of a close person (e. g. , parent, relationship partner) or the semantic features of trait words, self judg- ments of trait knowledge have not been reliably associated with greater activation in the MTLs (see meta-analysis by Martinelli et al. , 2013) . In contrast, both episodic memory retrieval and the retrieval of autobiographical facts are related to MTL activation (Martinelli et al. , 2013) . 1. 1. HMLO4O: impaired self trait knowledge in an individual with medial temporal lobe amnesia In this context, we present the case of HML040, an 80-year-old individual who was working and functioning independently prior to developing profound retrograde and anterograde amnesia secondary to bilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) strokes. Available to us at referral, clinical MRI and CT scans revealed extensive bilateral lesions to the hippocampus from the strokes, as well as surrounding MTL regions. The lesions from the strokes extended into inferior temporo-occipital cortex, especially on the left, but critically did not include the vmPFC. In light of these neuroimaging data, we conducted an initial assessment of autobiographical memory in HML040, expecting to find spared self trait knowledge in the face of amnesia for episodic memory and autobiographical facts. Not surprisingly, we found that HML040 had episodic and factual autobiographical amnesia. However, contrary to prior cases of amnesia, we found that HML040 could not reliably or accu- rately rate his personality traits neither for who he is now nor for who he was prior to his amnesia. CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 43 We subsequently administered a series of experimental tasks to HML040 and a control group to a) explore possible explanations for HML040's poor self trait knowledge perfor- mance, and b) better characterize the degree to which his autobiographical memory knowledge base was impoverished. Regarding possible explanations for his impaired self trait knowledge, we considered whether HML040 had degraded semantic knowledge of traits as social concepts, if he was unable to make reliable or accurate judgments of anyone's traits, and if he had a global impairment in accessing his self- concept. As we will show in Section 3. 2, HML040's perfor- mance did not support any of these hypotheses. Instead, the results suggest that, although his impaired trait knowledge was specific to the self, it was not accompanied by broader deficits in the self-concept, and it occurred in the context of extensive disruption of his autobiographical memory knowl- edge base. As we elaborate in Section 4, HML040 provides in- sights into the organization and neural substrates of self trait knowledge. 2. Description of present case study 2. 1. Case history HMLO40 was an 80-year-old male with 20 years of education when he participated. HML040 experienced sequential bilat- eral PCA strokes, the second of which involved the left PCA territory and resulted in the onset of his memory impairment approximately one and a half years before our initial evalua- tion. His previous right PCA stroke was clinically silent. HMLO040's wife reported that prior to his second stroke, he had no cognitive difficulties, was working full time, and was completely independent in activities of daily living. She also reported that his memory impairment appeared to be stable after his strokes, as opposed to worsening, with no new cognitive difficulties surfacing recently. 2. 2. Neuroimaging data Information about lesion localization was available from clinical scans. Part A of Fig. 1 shows the location of HML040's strokes based on a CT scan obtained around the time of our initial evaluation (approximately one and a half years after his second stroke) as it provides the best spatial resolution and MTL definition of the PCA infarcts. We also present T2 FLAIR images from a clinical MRI obtained a few days after the sec- ond stroke (part B of Fig. 1) . Review of the scans revealed that his strokes affected the entire length of the hippocampus and surrounding MTL structures bilaterally. The stroke also extended into inferior temporo-occipital regions bilaterally, but more so on the left. Posterior cortical regions of the autobiographical memory network, including lateral and medial parietal cortex/cingulate, were not directly lesioned by the strokes, nor did the strokes affect the anterior lateral temporal lobes or the prefrontal cortex. There was evidence of left posterior thalamic involvement, but the lesion did not encompass the anteroventral or medial dorsal thalamic nuclei implicated in memory function (Van Der Werf et al. , 2003) . There was no evidence of age disproportionate cortical atrophy. In addition, consistent with HML040's history of hy- pertension, the MRI revealed moderate chronic deep and periventricular white matter ischemic changes, sparing the vmPFC. Based on review of the clinical scans, we observed no obvious changes between the acute stage MRI obtained shortly after the second stroke and the subsequent CT ob- tained one and half years later, suggesting no intervening clinical incident or development of new pathology. 2. 3. Case assessment We obtained informed consent from all participants in this study in accordance with the University of Arizona Institu- tional et al. , 2010) , verbal phonemic and animal fluency (Benton et al. , 1983) , and Trail Making Test A & B (Reitan & Wolfson, 1985) . The study procedures and analyses were not preregistered. 2. 3. 1. | Neuropsychological and psychological assessment As part of our initial research work-up, HML040 was admin- istered a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests approximately one and a half years after his second stroke. In terms of premorbid intelligence and functioning, HML040 achieved 20 years of education and worked in a highly demanding career requiring a professional degree. As seen in Table 1, HMLO40 demonstrated a pattern largely consistent with MTL amnesia, characterized by impaired learning and memory with what appears to be largely, albeit not complete, sparing of intellectual functioning and other cognitive do- mains. On the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008) , HML040 demon- strated low average overall intelligence, with average verbal comprehension and low average perceptual reasoning. Consistent with his educational and _ occupational Fig. 1 Part A includes axial CT images of HML040's lesions approximately 1. 5 years after the second PCA stroke. The eight images track the lesion from ventral (top left) regions to those more dorsal (bottom right) . Part B shows axial images from the MRI T2 Flair that was obtained a few days after the second stroke. They also track from ventral to dorsal in the same order. background, his Similarities score was high average, which is correlated with measures of premorbid function in healthy adults (' ) . However, the Vocabulary and Information subtest scores were in the average range, which may represent a decline from premorbid levels. If these scores do reflect a decline, we suspect it is attributable to a loss of semantic knowledge, which further assessment showed to be an area of difficulty for HML040. HML040 consistently per- formed near the floor on learning and memory assessed by the WMS-IV ( ) . As a result, his performance was profoundly impaired for verbal and non-verbal memory across multiple subtests, with delayed memory more severely impaired than immediate memory. In regard to language and non-personal semantic memory, or general semantics ( ) , HML040's performance was somewhat mixed. Whereas his performance on a verbal comprehension test of basic semantic knowledge was spared (Pyramids and Palm Trees; ) , he showed mild to moderate object naming impairment (Boston Naming Test-II, ; Cambridge Naming Test, ) . Verbal fluency was also impaired on generating words for animals. In the executive functioning domain, HML040 showed normal working memory on the WAIS-IV, and his performance was low average on generating words that begin with a particular letter, namely F , A , and S ( ) . Whereas performance on Trails B was impaired, he was likely hindered by slow mental and psychomotor processing speed as demonstrated by the WAIS-IV tasks and Trails A. Notably, Trails B was normatively similar to Trails A ( ) . We also did not observe any clinical signs of frontal lobe impairment in our interactions with HML040. We administered additional semantic memory tests that assessed HML040's ability to retrieve unique information from several categories of non-personal knowledge including famous people (names and facts) , landmarks, and historical facts (see supplemental materials for full task descriptions) . Our motivation for administering these tasks was to assess non-personal semantics at a more unique level akin to auto- biographical memory assessment ( ) . HMLO40 was consistently impaired across these tests. Addi- tionally, we stratified the results of the Famous Faces and Historical Events tasks to examine whether a temporal gradient was present in HML040's performance. Although there was no discernible temporal pattern for his Historical CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 45 Table 1 HML040's neuropsychological performance.

Standardized scores from the subtests and indices of the WAIS-IV and WMS-IV are scaled scores and index scores, respectively, and derived from the published norms. z-scores are reported for all general semantic (except Pyramids and Palm Trees) and executive function tests. Both fluency tests, Boston Naming Test-II, and Trails z-scores were based on norms from Heaton et al. , 2004. The z-scores for the last four general semantic tasks were calculated from HML040's matched control group described in Section 3. The z-score for Cambridge Naming Test was calculated using a different, unpublished control sample of healthy middle age and older adults (N = 32) . For Pyramids and Palm Trees, percent correct is reported in the standardized score column and a score of >90% is considered within normal limits (WNL) per published norms. WAIS-IV = Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth edition, WMS-IV = Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth edition. Events performance (all z-scores < 2. 11) , knowledge for Famous Faces in earlier decades was better preserved than for later decades (1940s 1950s z-score = . 69, 1960s 1970s z- score = 1. 85, 1980s 1990s z-score = 5. 16, 2000s 2010s z- score = 4. 40) . As part of our work up, we also reviewed HMLO040's psy- chological history. Per medical records, HML040 had a history of chronic depression and was on antidepressant medication at the time of testing. Clinical depression was not formally assessed because depression questionnaires require in- dividuals to make subjective judgments about the recent past (e. g. the past week) , which would likely be difficult for HMLO40 considering his severe anterograde amnesia. Our behavioral observations were that he was in good spirits overall, but when testing became more difficult or when he was more aware of his difficulties, he appeared down. 2. 3. 2. Initial autobiographical memory assessment HML040 was administered two tests of autobiographical memory as part of the initial research battery. The first was the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI; Kopelman et al. , 1989) , which assesses episodic memory and personal semantics and was completed in a single session. The second was a personality trait questionnaire that we have used before (Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Marquine et al. , 2016) and for which we have in-lab normative data available on a group of older 46 CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 Table 2 HML040's autobiographical memory performance.

The normative sample for the Autobiographical Memory Interview (N = 34) comes from Kopelman et al. , 1989, whereas the normative sample for the personality trait ratings (N = 21) comes from our lab. Personality trait rating scores are represented as intraclass correlation coefficients. adults (N = 21, mean age = 73) collected prior to the current study. For the personality trait questionnaire, on two occa- sions separated by one week, HML040 was asked to rate the degree to which 84 traits describe his current personality, using a four-point scale ranging from not at all to definitely me. Though the traits were the same at both assessments, they were presented in a different order. Half of the traits were identified as positive and half as negative (Marquine et al. , 2016) utilizing likableness ratings (Anderson, 1968) . In addi- tion to judging his current or anterograde personality, HML040 completed a version that assessed retrograde personality (i. e. , before your strokes ) . We also had his wife complete the questionnaire describing HML040's personality, enabling an assessment of HML040's accuracy (our normative sample does not include accuracy data) . Reliability was calculated with one-way intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) , single measure, between the first and second ratings of participants' self-ratings (for both retrograde and anterograde rating sets in HMLO40) , as well as other person ratings. Accuracy was calculated with two-way mixed ICCs, absolute agreement, between HML040 and his wife's ratings of his retrograde and anterograde personality traits. HMLO40 exhibited profound impairment for all three types of autobiographical memory. The results, shown in Table 2, demonstrate that both remote and recent episodic and per- sonal semantic memory were severely impaired, as was retrograde and anterograde self trait knowledge reliability when compared to our in-lab normative sample. The accuracy of HML040's self-trait ratings was also poor when compared with his wife's ratings of his personality. 3. Follow-up assessment prompted by HML040's impaired self trait ratings To better understand the cause of HML040's impaired self trait knowledge, in Parts 1 and 2, we administered established and novel tasks to test several hypotheses related to this pattern of results. In both series, HML040 was compared to a group of six controls. We determined this sample size was adequate because it is a slightly larger ratio of controls to patients in comparison to a similar study using the same statistical approach (Robin et al. , 2019) . The control participants (4 fe- males and 2 males) were matched to HML040 in age (M = 76. 5, SD = 3. 02) , p > . 10, and level of education (M = 18. 67, SD = 2. 42) , p > . 10, according to a single patient-to-group Bayesian t-test approach (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2007; Makowski, 2018; R Core Team, 2019) . Given the age range of our controls, they were assessed using a brief neuropsychological battery to rule out cognitive impairment (Grilli, Wank, Bercel, et al. , 2018) . Control participants received the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) to rule out clinical depression. 3. 1. Approach to data analysis for parts 1 and 2 Many of our experimental cognitive tests in Parts 1 and 2 did not produce normally distributed data in controls. For this reason, we chose to calculate descriptive statistics to examine HMLO040's performance, which is consistent with prior research comparing single cases to controls on tests for which cognitively unimpaired performance is not normally distrib- uted (Robin et al. , 2019) . On each test, we calculated z-scores for HML040 based on the group performance of matched controls. The following classification was used for z-score qualifiers reported below: z-scores < 2 standard deviations were identified as impaired, 2 < z-scores < 1. 4 standard deviations were borderline, 1. 4 < z-scores < . 7 standard deviations were low average, and . 7 > z-scores > +1. 4 stan- dard deviations above were average to high average. To determine reliability between first and second personality trait ratings in controls, as we did with HML040, one-way intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) , single measure, were calculated. When a measure of accuracy was needed (ie. , between HML040 and his wife's ratings of her personality traits) , we calculated two-way mixed ICCs, absolute agree- ment. We also conducted reliability analyses for tests that required scoring of episodes, episodic details, autobiograph- ical facts, and general, or non-personal, semantic knowledge (described in Sections 3. 2. 1 and 3. 3. 1 and Supplemental Ma- terials) . All analyses and data visualization were conducted in RStudio (R Core Team, 2019) , using the ggplot2 (Wickham, CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 47 2016) , reshape2 (Wickham, 2007) , ggrepel (Slowikowski, 2020) , and ggpubr (Kassambara, 2020) packages. 3. 2. Part 1: investigation of HML040's trait and self- concept knowledge In an attempt to understand HML040's impaired knowledge of his personality traits, we first considered three hypotheses: 1) Was HMLO40's impairment in judging his own personality traits reflective of a general deficit in understanding the meaning of traits as social concepts, 2) Was HML040's impairment related to an inability to apply knowledge of traits to specific individuals (self or other) , or 3) Was HML040 unable to bring to mind a conceptualization or schema of himself (i. e. , self-concept) , affecting his ability to judge his own traits? 3. 2. 1. Part 1 methods and materials Before addressing our hypotheses, we assessed whether HMLO040's self-trait ratings were similarly impaired when we compared his performance to his age and education matched controls by calculating a reliability z-score derived from reli- ability ICCs of the six controls. To investigate HML040's general knowledge of personality traits (Hypothesis 1) , we administered the Social and Non- Social Concepts Task, which assessed the precision of ab- stract semantic knowledge for the relationship between social and non-social concepts. The task was taken from Pobric et al. (2016) where participants were presented with a probe word, a target word, and a distractor word on a computer screen. They were instructed to make a judgment of whether the target or distractor was more closely related in meaning to the probe. In the original study, there were a total of 160 items where half were social words, including words referring to personality traits (e. g. probe: respected, distractor: wicked, target: admired) and other social scenarios (e. g. , probe: refuge, dis- tractor: novelty, target: sanctuary) , whereas the other half were non-social abstract words (e. g. , probe: frequency, dis- tractor: edition, target: occurrence) . We randomly selected five social and five non-social words to use as practice. Partici- pants were provided with accuracy feedback during practice. They then cycled through a randomized presentation of 75 triads of social words and 75 triads of non-social words, recording their responses using corresponding keyboard but- tons. The correct answer for both word types (social and non- social) was presented on the left and right sides of the screen equally. The outcomes of interest were accuracy for social, non-social, and total items. To more specifically assess for HMLO040's trait knowledge, we conducted a follow-up analysis for which we separated 26 of the 75 social items that assessed trait knowledge (i. e. , the probe, target, and distractor words were all traits) and calculated accuracy scores for trait and non-trait items. We also examined whether HML040 was reliable and ac- curate in judging personality traits of an individual other than himself (Hypothesis 2) . Another version of the 84-item per- sonality trait questionnaire (Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Marquine et al. , 2016) was administered twice (t1 and t2) , separated by about one to two weeks, to participants who were asked to rate the traits of a personally known individual (for HML040, this was his wife) . We also asked HML040's wife to rate her own personality to measure HML040's ability to accurately judge another person's traits. Other person accu- racy was not assessed in controls as we did not collect trait ratings from the identified person. Notably, we instructed our participants that they needed to select a person whom they were very close to and felt that they could most accurately rate, and not that the other person could or would be willing to participate in research. A third potential source of HML040's impaired self trait knowledge is that he has a fundamental deficit in the ability to access his self-concept (Hypothesis 3) , which we assessed with four tasks. The Twenty Statements Test has been commonly used in prior studies of amnesia and related memory disorders as a basic measure of self-concept access, or identity strength (Addis & Tippett, 2004) . In our use of the Twenty Statements Test, participants were given a sheet of paper with 20 I Am statements and asked to com- plete as many statements as they could with a word or short phrase describing their identity. Consistent with prior research using this task to assess self-concept strength in individuals with memory disorders (Addis & Tippett, 2004; Ben Malek et al. , 2018; Philippi et al. , 2017) , our primary outcome of interest was the total number of self-statements completed by HMLO40 relative to the controls. In another assessment of self-concept, we asked whether HMLO040 was able to generate related autobiographical mem- ories for self-defining I Am statements. In an adaptation of a task developed by Rathbone et al. (2009) , the Self-Defining Memory Task asked participants to select six 1 AMs from the Twenty Statements Test, and then to provide six memories supporting each statement. Participants were asked for memories one at a time, and responses were audio recorded. Consistent with prior work, we assessed whether the mem- ories were episodes, experience-near or episodic-like auto- biographical facts (i. e. , facts associated with a spatiotemporal context) , or experience-far or more abstract autobiograph- ical facts (Grilli & Verfaellie, 2015; 2016) . binary coding of whether a trait was endorsed yielded strikingly similar results. In this analysis, ratings of 1 meant the trait was not endorsed, whereas the remaining ratings were classified as endorsed.

He exhibi- ted fair reliability for retrograde negative traits (ICC = . 525) . * When comparing HML040's and his wife's ratings of his per- sonality, his accuracy describing anterograde self traits was poor based on conventional cutoffs for ICC analyses (Cicchetti, 1994) , ICCy = . 149, ICCy2 = . 171, and poor to fair for his retrograde ratings, ICC, ; = . 429, ICC, z = . 52. Of note, these low reliability and accuracy scores occurred in the context of HMLO040 showing a strong positivity bias of endorsed traits for anterograde (Zt: = 3. 04, z: 2 = 2. 75) , and retrograde (z: 1 = 1. 89, Zt2 = 1. 42) self trait ratings when comparing the proportion of positive traits endorsed out of total traits endorsed to those of controls. Addressing Hypothesis 1, HML040 demonstrated impaired accuracy on the Social and Non-Social Concepts Task for so- cial concepts (z = 5. 48) , non-social concepts (z = 3. 17) , and overall (z = 4. 64) . Critically, in our follow-up analysis of so- cial concepts that tested trait knowledge, HML040 missed only one item (accuracy = 96%) , but we were unable to calculate a CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 49 Self-Defining Memory Task 30} 20) Number of Responses Generated | Episodic Memories Experience-Near Facts Tennessee Self-Concept Scale-lIl @ 7. 5) Ae eg 8 50 e o = a ae 25 e 0} 6 Inconsistency Ambivalence Ss Experience-Far Facts Total Memories Generated Self-Projection Task ; [| 20 Total Score 0 aS Tcannot imagine Responses Correct Probable Responses Fig. 3 Plot (A) shows the total memories or facts generated on the Self-Defining Memory Task.

Spe- cifically, he demonstrated low average reliability, z = . 89 (ICC = . 771, Fig. 2) , and excellent accuracy, ICC, ; = . 783 and ICC, z = . 728, based on conventional cutoffs for ICC. Relevant to Hypothesis 3, HML040 demonstrated normal access to his self-concept via the Twenty Statements Test, as he was able to generate 20 I Am statements, like con- trols (a z-score cannot be calculated as there was no vari- ability in the control group) . For the Self-Defining Memory Task, HML040 showed a seemingly normal ability to support his core self-concept with autobiographical memories, z = . 60. However, consistent with prior research (Grilli & Verfaellie, 2015; 2016) , HML040 showed an experience-far shift in the types of autobiographical memories used to ground his self-concept. Specifically, relative to the controls, the number of episodic memories HML040 generated was low average, z = 1. 11, the number of experience-near facts was borderline, z = 1. 56, and the number of experience-far facts was high average, z = 1. 10. On the TSCS-II, HML040's spared ability to reliably access his self-concept in a broader way than for rating trait knowledge was evidenced by average performance on the inconsistency score, z = . 37, and high average performance on the number of vague self- descriptiveness responses (Identity sub-scale questions) , z= 1. 18. The Self-Projection Task, assessing HML040's ability to project his sense of self to a specific, contextualized scenario and introspect on how he might feel showed that he provided an average number of I don't know how I would feel responses, z = . 79, and an average number of correct probable responses, z = . 41. All results under Hy- pothesis 3 can be found in Fig. 3. 3. 2. 3. Part 1 summary HMLO40 had impaired reliability and accuracy of retrograde and anterograde self trait knowledge, encompassing both positive and negative traits. Though impaired overall on the 50 CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 Social and Non-social Concepts Task, HML040 exhibited near perfect performance for the trials that tested trait concepts specifically (i. e. , 96% correct) . More conclusively, HML040 performed within normal limits in rating his wife's person- ality traits, suggesting that not only did HML040 have access to personality trait knowledge, he implemented this knowl- edge to make reliable and accurate trait judgments of a familiar other. Lastly, HML040 demonstrated normal per- formance on tasks evaluating his ability to access his self- concept and engage in self-reflection. In summary, the overall findings from these tasks suggest that HML040's deficit in rating his own traits is not likely explained by a lack of basic trait knowledge, a general difficulty in making judgments about the traits of specific individuals, or an inability to self-reflect. 3. 3. Part 2: deeper exploration of HML040's autobiographical memory knowledge base At first glance, the sparing of the vmPFC and self-concept makes HML040's unreliable and inaccurate judgments of his personality both unexpected and unique. However, according to Gilboa and Marlatte s (2017) model of schema representa- tion, the vmPFC does not operate alone. Rather, the instanti- ation of a schema, such as the self-schema, may involve vmPFC temporarily binding together long-term memory rep- resentations stored in other neural regions. HMLO040's impaired self trait knowledge, therefore, may reflect a limited pool of autobiographical facts (with episodic memories potentially also playing a minor role) to support self trait judgments, rendering some judgments less accurate and reliable. Although the AMI hinted at the severity of HML040's impairment, we aimed to provide a more extensive evaluation of his autobiographical memory, and a more precise charac- terization of the integrity of experience-near and experience- far autobiographical facts, by administering tasks that eval- uate his ability to recall unique personal episodes and to describe his life story. 3. 3. 1. Part 2 methods and materials To assess his ability to describe unique personal events, we had HMLO040 and controls complete the Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al. , 2002) , an empirically-supported measure of richness (i. e. , amount of detail) of memories of unique life events. This task was administered on a different day than the AMI for HMLO40. Participants were asked to retrieve one memory from each of the following time periods that targeted HML040's retrograde memory: (1) Before age 18, (2) Between ages 18 and 30, (3) Between ages 31 and 64, and (4) Between ages 65 and 75. We attempted to gather three anterograde memories from HML040 (i. e. , from the past year or so) , but he was not able to do so. Participants were given 5 min to describe their memory, with one general prompt (i. e. , can you tell me more?) if they stopped prior to the time limit. These unique event memories were scored using an adapted version of the original Autobiographical Interview scoring protocol. Specifically, we used the standard internal or episodic detail categories and the standard external detail categories, which include semantic details, other language features (e. g. , meta-comments and editorializing) , repetitions, and narration of events unrelated to the target autobio- graphical memory. We further divided personal semantic details into experience-near and experience-far facts, ac- cording to a recently established scoring protocol (Acevedo- Molina et al. , 2020) . Given that the Autobiographical Interview is most directly a test of the integrity of episodic autobiographical memory, to better understand HML040's access to personal semantics in his autobiographical memory knowledge base, we also had HMLO40 and the controls describe their life story. We used a protocol we developed, which instructs participants to tell the story of their life, from the beginning until the present day (Grilli, Wank, & Verfaellie, 2018) . There was no time limit, but participants were encouraged to take at least 15 min. To further encourage participants to be thorough and to help guide them through the process, participants were told when 5, 10, and 15 min passed. No other prompting or cueing was provided, with the exception of briefly reorienting HML040 when needed. Similar to the Autobiographical Interview, we scored for episodic details, experience-near and experience- far facts, general semantic details, metacomments, and repetitions. For these two autobiographical memory tasks, two trained raters scored all participants' narratives. Averages of the two raters were calculated and used for z-score calculations. Excellent reliability was achieved for episodic, personal se- mantic, other, and total details from the Autobiographical Interview (Cronbach's alpha range = . 90 . 99) . Average general semantic details had lower reliability (Cronbach's alpha = . 18) because there were very few occasions where these details were scored. On the Autobiographical Interview, good reli- ability was found for experience-near (Cronbach's alpha = . 86) and experience-far details (Cronbach's alpha = . 82) . Good to excellent reliability was achieved for total episodic, total experience-near, and total experience-far details in the Life Story Task (Cronbach's alpha range = . 80 . 90) . 3. 3. 2. Part 2 results Results for the following tasks are found in Fig. 4. On the Autobiographical Interview, HML040 showed impaired per- formance in generating autobiographical details overall, Z = 2. 05. As expected, the majority of details for controls were episodic (Levine et al. , 2002) , and HML040 demonstrated impaired performance on average episodic details produced, z = 2. 23, with borderline episodic detail scores for three of the memories (i. e. , before age 18, between ages 18 and 30, and between ages 31 and 64) and impaired episodic detail score for the most recent time period (i. e. , between ages 65 and 75) . He also had low average performance on experience-near factual details produced, z = 1. 07, and high average performance on experience-far factual details produced, z = . 91. For all mem- ories but one, HML040 did not provide more specific details (ie. , episodic) after the general probe, and instead gave more experience-far or experience-near facts. In the Life Story Task, HML040 demonstrated borderline performance generating autobiographical details overall, Zz = 1. 52. More specifically, HML040's total experience-near fact generation was borderline, z = 1. 96, episodic detail generation was low average, z = . 88, and experience-far fact production was low average, vmPFC, and yet demonstrated impaired self trait knowledge. This impairment occurred in the context of intact conceptual knowledge of traits, reliable and accurate judgments about the traits of another close individual, and preserved ability to access his self-concept in a variety of ways. HML040's impaired trait knowledge, therefore, seems to be specifically autobiograph- ical in nature, and is accompanied by an impoverished episodic and experience-near autobiographical memory knowledge base. 4. 1. Knowing one's personality: a role for experience- near autobiographical facts and the medial temporal lobe? Impaired self trait judgments in the context of spared ratings of a close other's traits renders HML040's profile particularly unique. On the one hand, the notion that either self or other trait knowledge could be selectively impaired is not without precedent (D. B. showed sparing of self ratings; Klein & Lax, 2010; Klein et al. , 2002; while J. S. had spared other ratings; Marquine et al. , 2016) . Relatedly, functional neuroimaging studies suggest that whereas self and other trait ratings acti- vate a common neural network, they do so in subtly distinct ways (Martinelli et al. , 2013; Northoff et al. , 2006; van der Meer et al. , 2010) . On the other hand, based on current cognitive (Klein, 2012) and cognitive neuroscience models (Renoult et al. , 2012) , an individual with largely isolated MTL lesions should have spared abstract personal semantics, of which self trait knowledge is believed to be one type. In fact, at least one form of meaning varying across contexts, as opposed to dispositional or stable (Pronin & Ross, 2006) . From this viewpoint, narrow or situational traits may be more likely to require recall of one's demeanor in particular spatiotemporal contexts and therefore draw on experience-near autobiographical factual knowledge reliant on MTL structures. Future research could test this possibility directly. On the whole, we believe that our findings, along with related evidence (Charlesworth et al. , 2015; Grilli & Verfaellie, 2015; 2016; Hampson et al. , 1987; Renoult et al. , 2016; Tanguay et al, 2018) , suggest that a completely abstract characterization of self trait knowledge is overly simplistic. Yet, if self trait knowledge is supported by a subset of experience-near autobiographical facts that are MTL depen- dent, why have no prior cases of amnesia demonstrated a reduction in self trait knowledge reliability and accuracy? Here, we think it is noteworthy that HML040's personal se- mantic impairment appears to be more severe than that for other amnestic patients in whom self trait knowledge was studied (Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Klein et al. , 2002; Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Tulving, 1993) . In fact, personal semantic knowl- edge was relatively intact according to the AMI in these earlier cases. Another notable aspect of HML040's profile is that his personal semantic memory impairment also stretches back to childhood, which is rare for MTL amnesia (Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Klein et al. , 2002; Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Tulving, 1993) . Intriguingly, the remote epoch on the AMI overlaps with the period of time during which, according to some prior work (Rathbone et al. , 2008, 2011) , much of one's self trait knowl- edge may emerge. Our findings, therefore, may indicate that remote, experience-near autobiographical facts are particu- larly important for maintaining much of an individual's self trait knowledge base (also see Addis & Tippett, 2004) . 4. 2. A subjective self without self trait knowledge? Self trait knowledge has held a prominent role in the notion that the self-concept may depend on autobiographical mem- ory (Conway, 2005; Prebble et al. , 2013; Rathbone et al. , 2015) . It is therefore interesting that HML040 appears to provide evi- dence that fundamental access to the self can be spared in the face of impairment to self trait knowledge. For instance, although it is unknown whether the 20 I Am statements he provided reflect an accurate or representative view of himself, HMLO40 ultimately produced a version of himself with these statements. Additionally, he was able to access the basic features of a typical self-concept because he was not overly uncertain or unreliable about his preferences and identity on the TSCS-II, and because he not only could engage in the Self- Projection Task and imagine his feelings in specific scenarios, but he also produced prototypical answers. Overall, we take our findings to suggest that the absence of reliable or accurate access to self trait knowledge does not preclude a person from engaging in other forms of self-reflection or self-projection. 4. 3. Connection between non-personal semantics and the medial temporal lobe Based on our neuropsychological testing of non-personal se- mantic memory (reported in Section 2. 3. 1) , HML040's perfor- mance was mixed on traditional neuropsychological tests, but clearly impaired on our experimental tests of semantic knowledge that required the retrieval of facts about unique entities. This was evident regardless of whether we examined HMLO040's knowledge of famous people, landmarks, or histor- ical events, and extended beyond a simple anomia for proper names. His semantic memory impairment, therefore, was extensive, encompassing personal semantics and non- personal semantics that have a higher degree of specificity, while preserving some forms of more abstract knowledge in both domains (e. g. , experience-far autobiographical facts and CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 53 basic or category-level semantic knowledge as assessed by Pyramids and Palm Trees) . There has been recent appreciation for the possibility of hippocampal, or more broadly MTL, involvement in retrieval of unique non-personal semantic memory. A few studies have suggested that the MTL might facilitate the retrieval of details from well-known stories and unique semantic asso- ciates of words (Klooster & Duff, 2015; Rosenbaum et al. , 2009; Verfaellie et al. , 2014) . Other cases of amnesia have also shown impairment in identification of famous faces and recollection of details of public or historical events (Cermak & O'Connor et al. , 2001; Cipolotti et al. , 2001; Damasio et al. , 1985; Kartsounis et al. patients also were shown to be impaired on one test assessing unique semantic knowledge (famous faces) , but our ability to compare HML040 with these cases is limited given the absence of more exten- sive testing for unique non-personal semantic knowledge and autobiographical memory. Thus, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that left posterior temporo- occipital damage contributed to HML040's non-personal se- mantic memory deficit, we believe that it is unlikely to explain his severe impairment in retrieving both personal and non- personal semantic information. HMLO40's MRI also revealed evidence of chronic deep and periventricular white matter ischemic changes. Consistent with chronic subcortical white matter damage, on neuropsy- chological testing HML040 exhibited slowed mental process- ing speed, and possibly some mild executive dysfunction (although the latter may be confounded by processing speed) . We believe that this aspect of HML040's clinical profile is unlikely to account for his impaired self trait knowledge. First, the ischemic pathology was chronic and clinically asymp- tomatic at the time of his second PCA stroke and there was no evidence of substantial lesion burden in vmPFC. Second, the personality trait questionnaire was untimed and was in a forced choice recognition format, obviating demands on pro- cessing speed and executive functions. If processing speed and/or executive functions had a role, it is not clear why HMLO040's performance on the personality trait task for his wife would not be similarly impacted. Given HML040's age, it is important to consider the possi- bility of a neurodegenerative 2015; Lou et al. , 2019; Mulders et al. , 2015; Rive et al. , 2013) , which our clinical neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing might not have detected in HMLO40. Despite these points, in the current study, HML040 did not appear to show self-knowledge effects associated with depression, as there was no evidence for a negativity bias or reduced positivity bias in his trait ratings. Moreover, the literature does not appear to suggest a connection be- tween depression and lower reliability and/or a more inac- curate sense of self. In fact, individuals with severe depression appear to have a stable evaluative schema, similar to nondepressed individuals, though theirs is nega- tive (Ruehlman et al. , 1985) . Combining these results with our behavioral observations of HML040 being in good spirits, it is less likely, then, that his history of depression had a signifi- cant impact on these results. 4. 5. Conclusion In the current study, an individual with bilateral MTL damage resulting in severe amnesia for personal (episodes and facts) 54 CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 memory and non-personal semantic memory demonstrated a unique pattern of impairment. Despite having intact concep- tual knowledge of personality traits, ability to rate the per- sonality of a familiar other, and access to his self-concept, he was unable to accurately and reliably rate his own personality traits. These findings suggest that the self concept is not beholden to intact self trait knowledge, and they reveal a po- tential connection between self trait knowledge and experience-near 11. 028 Rosenbaum, R.

Introduction Through autobiographical memory we keep a record of the experiences, places, and people that compose our life story. According to cognitive models (Conway, 2005; Klein, 2012; Prebble et al. , 2013) , autobiographical memory consists of episodic memories (i. e. , autobiographical memories of unique events) , and personal semantics, including autobiographical facts (ie. , factual features of our life record) and self trait knowledge (i. e, broad knowledge about one's general demeanor or social behavior) . It is believed that these types of autobiographical memory collectively represent one's identity and are retrieved to reflect our past and contemplate our future (Levine et al. , 2002; Strikwerda-Brown et al. , 2019) . According to cognitive theory, self trait knowledge has many qualities that distinguish it from episodic memories and autobiographical facts (Conway, 2005; Grilli, 2017; Grilli, Bercel, et al. , 2018; Klein, 2012; Renoult et al. , 2012) . Predomi- nant among these qualities is its apparent abstractness. From a cognitive perspective, whereas episodes imprint details of a singular event, autobiographical facts represent specific knowledge, and traits reflect abstract themes that are far less specific to one context or event feature. In other words, traits capture the commonalities of large catalogs of experiences, possibly ranging widely in social and physical context, as well as time. As a result, self trait knowledge is believed to repre- sent life experience at a categorically more abstract level than other types of autobiographical memory. As support for an abstract characterization of self trait knowledge, cognitive neuroscience findings have associated personality traits with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) , which is believed to support schema-level know! edge (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014; Gilboa & Marlatte, 2017) . For instance, in a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies evaluating trait judgments, Martinelli et al. (2013) found that ventral and dorsal PFC and anterior cingulate cortex were reliably activated by the retrieval of self traits relative to traits about others. Neuropsychological findings, while based on a few cases, strengthen the idea that the vmPFC has a critical role in representing self trait knowl- edge, as three individuals with vmPFC damage (not isolated) have been shown to have varying degrees of unreliable and/or inaccurate self trait ratings (Marquine et al. , 2016; Philippi et al. , 2012; Philippi et al. , 2017) . Building on the perspective that self trait knowledge re- flects a type of abstract autobiographical memory, cognitive neuroscience research has suggested that the medial tempo- ral lobes (MTLs) may not be critical for self trait knowledge. For instance, Tulving (1993) reported that KC, who had extensive MTL lesions, could reliably rate his own postmorbid traits, which were accurately updated because they were different from his premorbid self as rated by his mother. This sparing occurred in the context of severely impaired episodic mem- ory, along with impaired autobiographical facts for Review Board.

Two trained raters scored data from all participants. z-scores were calculated from averaging the two raters scores for each memory type. Excellent reli- ability was achieved for experience-near and experience-far facts (Cronbach's alpha range = . 91 . 94) . Although reliability was low for episodic memories generated (Cronbach's alpha = . 17) , this was because there were very few occur- rences, aligning with prior research (Grilli, 2017; Grilli & Verfaellie, 2015) . The TSCS-II (Fitts & Warren, 1996) is designed to measure three components of the self-concept, namely identity (e. g. , I am an honest person ) , satisfaction (e. g. , I understand my family as well as I should ) , and behavior (e. g. , I take good care of myself physically ) , across five domains of life, including personal, family, social, moral, and physical. The first of two metrics that were our focus was an inconsistency score, which is how stably one evaluates their own prefer- ences, behavior, and beliefs (ie. , rating these statements similarly: I am a friendly person and I get along well with other people ) . Nine pairs of statements were included in this 48 CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 score that was calculated by summing the absolute value of the differences between the two ratings for each pair of statements. Second, we summed the number of Identity sub- scale questions given a vague self-descriptiveness score, meaning a score of 3 or partly true and partly false on a scale from 1 to 5. According to Addis and Tippett (2004) , vague responses on this measure can be viewed as a measure of self- concept uncertainty. We also considered the possibility that making self trait judgments at least in part requires what has been termed introspective computation, reflecting the ability to rate personality traits using a behavioral simulation when rele- vant autobiographical memories are unavailable (Juskenaite et al. , 2016) . It has been proposed that relying on introspec- tive computation may explain the sparing of personality trait judgments in patients with severe autobiographical memory loss (Juskenaite et al. , 2016) . We adapted a task from Ruby et al. (2007) that assessed the ability to project oneself into imagined social scenarios and judge how one would feel. Specifically, we created 36 novel social scenarios and asked participants to imagine how they would feel in each scenario (e. g. , Imagine you are at work, when your manager an- nounces the company has decided to promote you. Do you feel suspicious [distractor], carefree [distractor], excited target], or 1 cannot imagine how I would feel? ) . To reduce demands on naming or self-generation/fluency, which might disadvantage HMLO040, participants were given three emo- tions to choose from for each scenario, with one of the choices more probable than the two distractor emotions based on consensus between two researchers. Critically, to evaluate the ability to self-project into the scenario, partici- pants were given the fourth choice of I cannot imagine how I would feel . There were six sets of answer choices (i. e. , one set included one target emotion, two distracter emotions, and I cannot imagine option) that were each repeated six times throughout the task for a total of 36 scenario-answer choice combinations. These sets were quasi-randomized such that each would not appear more than three times in a row and each emotion choice was the target (i. e. , most probable answer) twice throughout the task. The critical outcome was the number of I cannot imagine how I would feel answers selected by the participants, but we also re- ported the total number of correctly identified probable an- swers. One control participant received a version of the task missing the I cannot imagine how I would feel answer choice and therefore this comparison is based on perfor- mance from five controls. 3. 2. 2.

Examining positive and negative traits separately, we found that HML040 had poor reliability 1 A z = 1. 32.

Part 2 summary HMLO040's performance across two autobiographical memory tests revealed that he had limited episodic memory and experience-near personal facts, with spared experience-far personal facts. 4. General discussion According to current cognitive models, of all the information stored in autobiographical memory, perhaps none is more abstract and schema-like than self trait knowledge (Conway, 2005; Klein, 2012) . This cognitive framing of autobiographical memory has been used to explain why fMRI findings and neuropsychological case studies suggest that self trait knowledge depends on the vmPFC for retrieval, as opposed to the MTL, which is necessary for episodic memories and experience-near (i. e. , spatiotemporal specific) autobiograph- ical fact knowledge. In the present study, we introduced HMLO40, an individual who has extensive bilateral MTL damage from two PCA strokes that spared abstract personal semantics, namely experience-far autobiographical facts, was largely preserved in HML040 and was relied on when drawing on autobiographical memory. One way to try to understand this unexpected trait knowledge outcome is to consider how self trait knowledge judgments are made, and why under certain circumstances, accessing experience-near autobiographical facts may be useful. On a personality trait questionnaire, an individual will likely have to judge many traits, some of which may have a stored representation in long-term memory, and others must be inferred. Abstract personal semantic knowledge may be sufficient to reliably and accurately judge the self- reflectiveness of many of these traits by either accessing a stored abstract representation of the traits or, consistent with a schema-instantiation perspective (Gilboa & Marlatte, 2017) , making a decision by using related experience-far autobio- graphical facts (e. g. , I'm kind because I've always cared about people) . However, some traits may depend more on context because of how they have evolved over time or how they differ by social situations. These traits may not be stored in an ab- stract form, and a person's ability to judge these sorts of traits presumably could not rely on abstract autobiographical nowledge, as doing so runs the risk of capturing an incon- sistent or inaccurate picture of these traits reflectiveness. Rather, such trait judgments should require drawing upon spatiotemporal knowledge that grounds and contextualizes these traits, such as particular lifetime periods (e. g. , lately I've been more patient) or repeated events (e. g. , I'm jovial when with friends) . By this logic, we suggest that knowing one's traits is not entirely the purview of abstract personal semantic memory. Instead, experience-near autobiographical facts have a role. According to our interpretation, the MTL should have a graded involvement in all forms of autobiographical memory, 52 CORTEX 147 (2022) 41-57 dropping from episodic memories, to autobiographical facts, to personality traits reflecting a shift in the relative episodic/ experience-near to abstract/experience-far nature of the knowledge base. HML040's performance supports such a conclusion, as revealed by his z-scores across these types of autobiographical memory. Recent event-related potential ev- idence from Renoult, Tanguay, and colleagues also can be viewed as further evidence in favor of this interpretation (Renoult et al. , 2016; Tanguay et al. , 2018) . These studies have shown that repeated events/autobiographical facts and self trait knowledge retrieval elicit an event-related potential late positive component (LPC) , an electrophysiological signal that is believed to reflect episodic processes (Brezis et al. , 2016; Friedman & Johnson, 2000; Rugg & Curran, 2007; Wilding & Ranganath, 2011) . One of these studies also indicated that the LPCs associated with autobiographical facts and present self trait knowledge are diminished relative to episodic memory, but more prominent than in tasks involving non- personal, conceptual trait knowledge based on social stereo- types (i. e. , traits of a soldier; Tanguay et al. , 2018) . Future studies can examine whether self trait knowledge, relative to knowledge about the traits of other personally known in- dividuals, is unique in the degree to which it remains groun- ded in experience-near personal semantic memory (i. e. , more context specific) , as this could explain why HML040 was able to reliably and accurately judge his wife's personality (Tanguay et al. , 2018, 2020) . In line with our experience-near hypothesis, prior work has also hinted at the idea that some aspects of self trait knowledge may depend on experience-near and episodic autobiographical memories. For instance, Grilli and Verfaellie (2015; 2016) showed that individuals with MTL amnesia shift from trait to role based self-defining statements while describing their identity, and they ground their self-defining statements largely with experience-far autobiographical facts. We speculate that this subtle drop in use of trait self- statements may reflect a decline in access to experience- near personality trait knowledge. Interestingly, Charlesworth et al. (2016) provided some support for this po- sition in cognitively normal young adults by showing that relative to retrieving general semantic memory, retrieving episodic memories results in more fluent access to self trait statements, but not roles or physical traits. Prior work has also suggested that personality traits may fall on a spectrum of category breadth, with some traits being more narrow or context specific (e. g. , charitable) and others more broad and context independent (e. g. , kind; Hampson et al. , 1987) . Simi- larly, there also is evidence that individuals are inclined to view many of their present personality traits as situational, , 1995; Klein et al. , 2002; Rempel- Clower et al. , 1996; Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) , consistent with some fMRI studies reporting recruitment of MTL regions in these tasks (Bernard et al. , 2004; Douville et al. , 2005; Leveroni et al. , 2000; Nielson et al. , 2010; Ross & Olson, 2012) . Relatedly, a recent study found that making judgments of semantic similarity for famous people and places activated anterior temporal and posterior medial networks, respectively, and there was evidence of functional connections between these networks and the hippocampus (Morton et al. , 2021) . There- fore, there may be unique knowledge from both personal and non-personal domains for which the MTLs are necessary; however, this may be overlooked when only tests of category-level semantic knowledge are administered where patients may perform within normal range (Duff et al. , 2020; Klooster & Duff, 2015) . We suggest that future research should attempt to compare personal and non-personal se- mantics using similar tasks, because doing so might reveal that they follow comparable organizational principles and depend on largely overlapping neural networks (Irish & Vatansever, 2020) . 4. 4, Additional considerations HMLO040's strokes caused bilateral, but predominantly left- sided, inferior temporo-occipital cortical damage. Prior cases of left inferior temporo-occipital damage following PCA strokes have been associated with non-personal semantic memory impairment, which tends to be greater for naming, with milder deficits in comprehension (Antonucci et al. , 2004, 2008; Roberts et al. , 2013, 2015) . These process affecting cognition. We think this is unlikely for two reasons. First, there were no obvious structural changes between the clinical brain scans done at the time of his second stroke and those done around the time of his evaluation in our laboratory. Second, his wife reported that he was fully independent and working prior to the second stroke, and there had been no additional cognitive decline beyond the acute change associated with the stroke. In regard to autobiographical memory, while we measured reliability and accuracy of self trait knowledge, we did not similarly measure reliability of episodic memory or autobiographical facts. We do, however, know that his wife's report raised no concerns that he might be confabulating. Also, some of our autobiographical memory testing involved free responses, with limited probing for more detail or in- formation. Therefore, we cannot say for sure whether some of our findings, such as HML040's Autobiographical Interview performance, underrepresent his fund of memory. This critique does not apply to our personality trait judgment task, which entailed force-choice recognition. Lastly, it is important to consider HMLO040's history of depression and current use of antidepressant medication in the context of possible alterations of self-perception in in- dividuals with depression. Prior research suggests in- dividuals with depression have a more negative self-view or a lower positive self-bias (Lou et al. , 2019) . Also, depression (and possibly antidepressant use) has been linked with sub- tle structural and functional disruption to prefrontal cortical regions (Kaiser et al. , autobiographical facts. More broadly, they highlight the role that single case studies can play in the advancement of cognitive neuroscience models of memory and the self.

        "case_report": "1196 (0. 6) during late pregnancy and 1. 7 (0. 9) at 6 months postpartum (mean (SD) , p = 0. 27) . Table 1 shows the CSF parameters in samples taken before (diagnostic lumbar puncture) , during and after pregnancy. Notably, the IgG- Index was significantly higher during preg- nancy than before pregnancy or after the delivery in all patients (p= 0. 0390) , but no difference was observed in the number of oligoclonal bands (table 1) . Enhanced clinical disease activity was associated with a higher number of CSF cells, as expected (table 1) , but no alteration was observed in the subtypes of CSF lymphocytes during versus after preg- nancy (data not shown) . To study whether the increased intrathecal IgG production was associated with a systemic Th2 shift, we measured intracytoplasmic IFN-y and IL-4 production in peripheral blood monocyte cells after phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin stimulation both during and after pregnancy. The percentage of IFN-y- secreting cells within the peripheral blood lymphocyte pool was significantly lower dur- ing pregnancy than in the postpartum period (2. 8 (0. 7) % (mean (SEM) ) IFN-y-producing cells during pregnancy and 7. 6 (0. 8) % during postpartum, p = 0. 003) . The difference in IL-4- producing cells during and after pregnancy was less pronounced (1. 0 (0. 16) % (mean (SEM) ) during pregnancy and 1. 8 (0. 15) % during postpartum, p = 0. 028) . This resulted in a Th2: Th1 ratio of 0. 36 during pregnancy and 0. 24 after delivery. Discussion This study describes, for the first time, that the production of intrathecal antibodies in patients with multiple sclerosis is higher during late pregnancy than in the postpartum period. A shift towards humoral (Th2) -type immune responses was shown during preg- nancy, and it is the most accepted theory to explain the amelioration of Thl-type diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy. Most of the data supporting the Th2 shift during pregnancy are derived, however, from mouse experi- ments, and the corresponding in vivo phe- nomena in pregnant women are poorly documented. Our finding of non-altered oligoclonal bands is in line with previous studies, which have shown that oligoclonal banding in the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis is persistent, and not affected by treatment, whereas the rate of IgG produc- tion is more susceptible to alterations. * The CNS parenchyma is not a physiological site for B-cell responses and antibody produc- tion, but, in multiple sclerosis, B cells are demonstrable in inflammatory infiltrates and in the CSF. Antibodies are indicative of chronic CNS inflammation and_ probably contribute to demyelination and axonal damage. Our data imply that factors other than intrathecal antibodies are crucial in the pathology leading to multiple sclerosis relapses in the postpartum period, as a reduction in the IgG-Index was associated with an increase in the relapse rate. Our data suggest that the consequences of alterations in the immune system leading to a Th2 shift in the periphery reach beyond the blood brain barrier and strengthen the humoral immune responses within the CNS.

Severe amnesia after a restricted lesion in the left hippocampal body Severe amnesia is caused by bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe, specifically cornus ammonis (CA) 1 of the hippocampal body. Although some authors have reported that profound amnesia results from a uni- lateral temporal lobe stroke, * * the part of the hippocampus that causes severe amnesia remains unknown. Here, we report the case of a patient who developed severe antero- grade amnesia and minimal retrograde amnesia after a focal haemorrhage in the hippocampal body. A 72-year-old right-handed man was admitted to the International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan, in May 1999 because of acute memory impairment. A few days before admission, he started forgetting what he had done and said several minutes earlier, and he could no longer name nearby objects. On admission, he was disoriented as to the year, month and day, and could not recall the names of objects that he had been told to remember a few minutes earlier. His symptoms continued and were persistent l month later. MRI Tl-weighted images Postscript 1 month after onset showed a haemorrhage in the left hippocampal body and in part of the hippocampal tail. The lesion included CAI, CA2 and CA3, the dentate gyrus and subiculum (fig 1) , and extended subcortically in the parahippocampal gyrus. A neuropsychological evaluation was car- ried out from 34 to 40 days after onset. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised score showed that verbal and delayed memory indices were markedly low, whereas the visual memory index was relatively preserved (attention and concentration 79, verbal memory 61, visual memory 79, general memory 65 and delayed recall 55) . A com- parison of the delayed test raw score total (II) with the first test raw score total (1) implied that both encoding and_ retrieval were impaired for verbal memory (II/I 0/6, full score 58/58) , whereas retrieval was mainly impaired for visual memory (II/I 6/33, full score 47/47) . The Benton Visual Retention Test score showed that both immediate figure reproduction (7/10) and reproduction after a 15s delay (3/10) were impaired. Delayed reproduction was also poor in the Rey- Osterreith Complex Figure Test (copying 36/ 36, 30 min delay 6/36) . Conversely, scores for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised were normal (verbal intelligence quotient (1Q) 105, performance IQ 121 and full-scale IQ 114) . Subtest scores for digit span (9/19; forward 4 and backward 4) and arithmetic (6/19) , however, were relatively low. Digit span forward was also 4 when presented visually on a personal computer. These findings suggested impaired short- term memory or working memory. Remote memory was assessed with an autobiographical memory interview and with the specific questions as described below. The patient could recall autobiographical episodes well, but could not remember public events 2 years before onset. For example, he remem- bered the British royal wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles in 1985, but did not remember Diana s death in August 1997. Furthermore, he remembered the Nagano Winter Olympics in February 1998, the Kobe earthquake in January 1995 and the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack in March 1995. To determine whether there was a temporal gradient in his past memory loss, we gave the patient an 80-question multiple- choice questionnaire on public events during the four decades from 1950 to 1989, divided into four sections with 20 questions for every 10 years. He showed a slight temporal gradient in these sections, but all these scores were above the normal mean (percentage correct (normal mean for +70-year-olds, D) *: 1950s, 95 (53. 7, 5. 45) ; 1960s, 85 (55. 3, 4. 83) ; 1970s, 75 (58. 5, 5. 05) ; 1980s, 70 (66. 8, 4. 94) ) . The patient profile was rated as follows: (1) This patient showed severe encoding and retrieval deficits in verbal memory. This can occur because of a unilateral left hippocampal lesion. A comparison of the reported cases shows that bilateral lesions of the hippocam- pus or medial temporal lobe can cause moderate to severe anterograde amnesia. Examination of our patient suggested that damage to the unilateral (left) hippocampal Postscript 1197 MRIT1 weighted axial (A, B) and coronal (C-E) images 1 month after onset showed a high-intensity area, suggesting a haemorrhage in the figyre 1 le#t hippocampus. The lesion included cornus ammonis 1-3, dentate pris and subiculum, and extended subcortically in the parahippocampal gyrus. The anterior part of the hippocampus that is, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal head appears intact. body (CA1-3, dentate gyrus) and subiculum was enough to result in severe anterograde amnesia. As no case report has described circumscribed damage to the amygdala, hippocampal head and entorhinal cortex, it is yet to be clarified whether these anterior lesions alone can cause severe anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia was minimal in our patient, although a detailed evaluation of his past memory showed a slight temporal gradient in the knowledge of events over the preceding 20 years. Studies on patients with reported amnesia with hippocampal lesions suggested that severe retrograde amnesia was caused by extensive damage to the hippocampal formation or to additional temporal lobe structures. That our patient showed minimal retrograde amnesia with sparing of the amygdala and hippocampal head is consistent with this view. Another possibility is that the anterior part of the hippocampus (hippocampal head and entorhinal cortex) is more associated with extensive retrograde amnesia than the hip- pocampal body. As the entorhinal cortex projects to the medial thalamus, whereas the subiculum (posterior hippocampus lesion in our patient) has connections to the anterior thalamic nuclei, it is rational to compare associated amnesic symptoms between the two lesions. Patients with a lesion limited to the anterior hippocampus would thus tend to show the involvement of this area in retrograde memory. Our patient also showed a reduced digit span, which indicated auditory and visual verbal short-term memory impairment. Few case reports have referred to digit span in temporal lobe amnesia. One possible expla- nation for the reduced digit span is that the haemorrhage affected extensive areas in the temporal and parietal lobes. In conclusion, a comparison of the patient s lesion and symptoms with those of previous cases with bilateral and unilateral hippocampal lesions suggests that severe anterograde ammesia can occur after a restricted lesion in the unilateral (left) hippo- campal body and subiculum, and that severe retrograde amnesia can be caused by addi- tional damage to the anterior hippocampus N Arai, C Shikai, S Fuse, T Shimpo Department of Neurology, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo Correspondence to: Dr Yasuhisa Sakurai, 1 Kanda- Izumi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-8643, Japan; ysakurai-tky@umin. ac. jp doi: 10. 1136/jnnp. 2005. 081372 Competing interests: None declared.

She became more alert and was able to communicate with gestures. Neurological examination, however, showed anarthria and inability to swallow, chew, or move her lips and tongue on command. Comprehension was retained dur- ing the whole episode, a fact that was proved after recovery, as the patient remembered specific details and events that had occurred during the entire incident. No focal signs were observed. Corneal, gag and jaw reflexes were preserved. Reflexive buccofacial move- ments such as yawning or coughing were present. Limb praxis was normal and eye movements were intact. Deep tendon reflexes were weak and no pyramidal signs were elicited. Routine blood tests disclosed mild normocytic anaemia and chronic renal fail- ure, with no change in her haemodynamic status. Infective and inflammatory screens were negative. Computed tomography of the brain showed moderate to severe brain atrophy and bilateral subcortical lacunar lesions. These findings were similar to those observed | year earlier. No evidence of a new subcortical infarction was seen. The electro- encephalograph (EEG) showed continuous rhythmic delta activity mixed with sharp waves and long periods of spike and wave ictal discharges (fig 1, left panel) , consistent with NCSE. Intravenous valproic acid was initiated. Regular haemodialysis was contin- ued. During the next few days she was able to initiate speech, move her tongue and bucco- oral muscles. She progressively regained her ability to swallow. On EEG performed 24 h after initiation of treatment, the spiky activity seen earlier had disappeared. Diffuse slowing of the background with gradual improvement was observed over a few days. An EEG performed 9 days later was normal (fig 1, right panel) . war : hy anal Postscript Two weeks after admission, owing to complete recovery, the treatment for epilepsy was gradually discontinued. Since then, the patient s neurological status and repeated EEGs have been normal. Discussion The clinical signs in this patient were consistent with FCMS. This condition, which may be congenital or acquired, persistent or intermittent, includes severe anarthria, loss of voluntary muscular functions of the face and tongue, and impaired mastication and swallowing, with preservation of reflex and autonomic functions. The aetiology of FCMS is heterogeneous: vascular insults in adult- hood, such as bilateral subsequent strokes; infections of the CNS, such as herpes simplex encephalitis or acute disseminated encepha- lomyelitis. FCMS can be congenital, owing to bilateral dysgenesis of the perisylvian region. FCMS as a manifestation of epilepsy has been described nearly exclusively in childhood. The clinical picture of our patient was initially attributed to an overdose of oxycodone. Only consciousness and not the facial, phar- yngeal and lingual and mastication move- ments, however, improved with discontinuation of the treatment. Uraemic aetiology could not be implicated, as there was no change in the renal status during the whole episode because the patient was reg- ularly haemodialysed. NCSE was diagnosed only by EEG, which showed an electroencephalographic pattern compatible with the diagnosis. NCSE seems to be associated with a high mortality and morbidity, justifying aggressive treatment. Oxycodone hydrochloride is an opiate derivative.

        "case_report": "Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry 1987; 50: 900-909 Bilateral paramedian thalamic artery infarcts: report of eight cases MASSIMO GENTILINI, ENNIO DE RENZI, GIROLAMO CRISI* From the Departments of Neurology and Radiology, * University of Modena, Italy sumMARY Eight consecutive patients with CT scan evidence of a bilateral infarct in the territory of the paramedian thalamic artery are reported. In seven cases the infarct also extended to the territory of the polar artery. The main symptoms were: (1) disorder of vigilance which cleared in a few days, and hypersomnolence which lasted longer and in two patients was still present a year later; (2) amnesia, detectable clinically in four patients and only with tests in two patients, which persisted in one patient for three years; (3) changes of mood and bulimia present in five and four patients respectively; and (4) vertical gaze paresis in five patients. Only one patient died, and in the remainder the symptoms tended to subside, but none of the patients who could be followed-up for a year returned to normal behaviour. Clinical and CT scan correlations pointed to the mammillo-thalamic tract as the structure whose damage was responsible for the memory disorders. Before computed tomography (CT) infarct of the thalamus was a diagnosis that the clinician could at most suspect, when confronted with a clinical picture resembling the classical Dejerine-Roussy s syn- drome, ! but not substantiate in the absence of verification by necropsy. Even more difficult and ten- tative was the recognition of the other topographical thalamic syndromes that had been reported. CT scan has greatly improved our ability to identify in vivo discrete syndromes corresponding to the involvement of the territories supplied by the thalamic arteries. Based on the anatomical description provided by Percheron>~* the following types have been identified: * (1) antero-lateral infarct, associated with polar artery occlusion; (2) postero-lateral infarct, associated with geniculo-thalamic artery occlusion; (3) infero-median infarct, associated with paramedian artery occlusion; and (4) infarct involving the globus pallidus, the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the lateral thalamic nuclei, associated with anterior choroidal artery occlusion. Address for reprint requests: Dr Ennio De Renzi, Clinica Neuro- logica, Via del Pozzo, 71, I-41100-Modena, Italy. Received 3 June 1986 and in revised form 28 October 1986. Accepted 6 November 1986 A well-defined clinical picture is represented by the bilateral infarct of the paramedian artery. This is not a rare event since the vessels of both sides can origi- nate from a common trunk. The area of distribution of the paramedian artery presents with anatomical variations from subject to subject, also, because it not rarely supplies the territory of an absent polar artery, and may be associated with the occlusion of the para- median mesencephalic artery. The area includes* the nucleus parafascicularis, the habenular- intrapeduncular tract (Meynert s retroflex bundle) , the antero-medial portion of the centromedian nucleus, the internal medullary lamina, the ventro- oral-medial nucleus and it may reach the mammillo- thalamic tract anteriorly. If the infarct extends to the territory of the polar artery, the lesion involves the anterior part of the ventral thalamus and, in particu- lar, encroaches upon the ventral pole of the mediodorsal nucleus, the ventral part of internal medullary lamina and part of the mammillo-thalamic tract. In this paper we report the clinical and CT scan findings of eight consecutive patients, seen in our department for a bilateral thalamic infarct in the terri- tory of the paramedian artery, which in most cases also extended to the territory of the polar artery. 900 UAdoo Aq paya}o1g aUIDIPayy yo Aueiqr] Aemjunoy sioues4 OUL Ye 1Z0% 0% JOQUISAON UO /wWOd\"[wq'duul/: dyYy Woy pepeojumog 2861 Ainr | UO 006'Z'OSduul/9E | LO} Se peysiignd ysuy : Asyeyohsq Hinsounen jouneN Bilateral paramedian thalamic artery infarcts: report of eight cases 901 Case reports Case 1 This 66 year old right-handed man was accustomed to take meals at his sister s house, since his wife s death 14 years earlier. One day he was particularly late to lunch and his sister telephoned him. The patient was surprised at her request, because, he said, it is just 6am and this is not lunch time. When he eventually came, his sister was amazed at hearing him speak about his wife as if she were still living with him. In the following days it was apparent that he did not know where he was and mistook day for night. On admission, the only neurological sign was a vertical gaze paresis, involving all kinds of movements in the downward direction and sparing the oculo-cephalic reflex in the upward gaze. The patient was alert, cooperative, and cheerful, but had no clear idea of why he had been hospitalised. He cor- rectly reported basic biographical data, had normal lan- guage comprehension and expression and could make sim- ple calculations, but his memory for both anterograde and retrograde events was poor. If not stimulated, he tended to sleep most of the day; yet, when awakened, he quickly answered questions. His thought content revealed a mixture of confabulation and delusions of grandeur. He claimed to live with a woman, sometimes identified as his dead wife, sometimes as a woman in all respects identical to her but whom he had just married, and sometimes as his wife s sister (who had never existed) . He also claimed that he was very rich, owning eight flats, and had a large Swiss bank account. He said that he could speak many foreign languages and was a general in the Air Force. He offered a large sum to a nurse if she would agree to come with me under the blankets, where nobody will see us. The symptomatology remained unchanged for the month during which he was hospitalised. A few days after he had returned home, he went to the police station asking why his wife had abandoned him. At the follow-up, 7 months later, he appeared cheerful and a bit garrulous, but perfectly oriented to time, place and person. He admitted that his wife was dead, and said that, after having lived for several years with her cousin, he now remained alone and was looking for a young girl who, enticed by his wealth, would be willing to marry him. He was well-informed on current events and showed no sign of Table | Intelligence and memory test scores memory deficit, but was still impaired on formal memory testing (table 1) . Vertical gaze paresis had improved. Case 2. This 47 year old woman suddenly complained of dizziness and fell to the ground, unable to answer any ques- tions. Taken to the emergency department of our hospital, she appeared drowsy and did not speak spontaneously, but reacted to painful stimuli and was able to obey elementary commands. Three days later she was admitted to the neu- rological ward. She was sleepy throughout the day, though frequently tossing in bed. When seated, she tended to fall forward or to the side. She correctly answered simple ques- tions in a whisper and with a few words, but never took the initiative to speak. A limitation of upwards saccadic and pursuit eye movements was observed, while downwards, lat- eral and convergence movements were normal. Relatives noticed that during the first 3 days of disease the patient voraciously ate whatever was offered to her. In the following 2 weeks drowsiness alternated with restlessness and a certain degree of aggressiveness: she accused doctors of trying to kill her, kicked out in bed and laughed coarsely. The behaviour slowly improved, but was still childish and euphoric a month later, when she was discharged. No retrograde amnesia was observed, but her performance on verbal learning memory tasks was poor (table 1) , possibly due to difficulties in con- centrating. At follow-up 18 months later, upward gaze paresis was still present and her husband reported that the patient passed most of the day in bed, sleeping much more than usual. However, when awake, she looked at television and read newspapers. She showed abnormal irritability. No memory deficit was observed. She was still hyperphagic and had increased 15kg in weight. In the following months, she fell into a depressive state, with feelings of guilt and worth- lessness, which required admission to a psychiatric ward. She improved after amitriptyline treatment. Case 3 This 35 year old man was, on awakening, unable to answer simple questions, apathetic and sleepy. Admitted to another hospital, he remained drowsy and speechless for a few days; when he began speaking again, he was grossly disoriented to time and place and forgetful of past and present events. He ate and drank voraciously and indiscrim- inately, without becoming satiated, and was hyper- Story Word list Paired associates N PIQ vIQ 1Q (15-76) * (6-58) * (8-73) * I (a) 82 106 94 5-88 497 6: 89 (b) 88 100 94 8-88 5-57 3-39 2 92 98 95 17-92 7-26 16-54 3 99 107 103 5-93 5-60 3-32 4a) 75 71 73 9-09 3-45 1-00 (b) 92 103 98 8-03 8-48 18-58 5 _ 6 _ 88 = - 5: 59 3-36 3-18 7 112 119 1S 3-09 5: 94 4-66 8 (a) 58 94 16 14-95 5-20 10-25 (b) 93 108 101 21-00 8-28 15-66 The second examination of Patients 1, 4 and 8 was carried out approximately three months later. *Cut-off for normal performance. yBuAdoo Aq pa}o9}0q auloIpal\\ Jo Aresqr] Aemjunog siouei4 OUL Ye 1Z0% 0% JOQUISAON UO /wWOd\"[wq'duul/: dyYy Woy pepeojumog 2861 Ainr | UO 006'Z'OSduul/9E | LO} Se peysiignd ysuy : Asyeyohsq Hinsounen jouneN 902 somnolent and irritable. These symptoms lasted for 2 months. When admitted to our department, 3 months post- onset, his behaviour was normal, except for a severe retro- grade and anterograde amnesia, which was still present on follow-up, 3 years later. He was very inaccurate about events and persons in Italian public life in the last 5 years and was unable to learn new information. No gaze disorder was ever observed. Case 4 This 53 year old man suddenly lost consciousness, and fell to the ground. He recovered in a few minutes, but in the subsequent hours his level of consciousness waxed and waned, oscillating from being able to answer simple ques- tions to total unresponsiveness. Admitted to the ward, he remained confused and sleepy for 6 days. When he became more alert and examinable, a vertical gaze paresis for both upwards and downwards voluntary and pursuit movements could be shown. A striking bulimia (to the point that the patient stole room-mates food) persisted for 20 days. He complained of weakness and sleepiness, showed a marked irritability and was prone to pity himself and weep. No memory deficit was clinically evident, though his per- formance on memory tests was poor (table 1) . On follow-up examination 2 years later, he complained of falling asleep during the day if he was not engaged in some activity. His mood had progressively returned to normal and he took great interest in sport news, which he correctly reported. His performance on memory tests was practically normal. Vertical gaze paresis was unchanged. Case 5 This 70 year old woman with a 15 year history of hypertension fell into a diencephalic coma which lasted 2 days. This was progressively followed by a state of fluctuating vigilance in which periods of marked somno- lence alternated with periods in which she could answer sim- ple questions with a slurred speech. Memory could not be tested, but orientation to time and space was faulty. No gaze movements on the vertical plane could be elicited. The patient died 17 days after the onset of disease. Case6 This 58 year old man with a long history of alcohol- ism was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department because of liver disorders. The consultant neurologist found him to be alert and cooperative with gait disorder, incoor- dination on the finger to nose and heel to knee tests, and with a mild peripheral paresis of the lower limbs with absence of tendon reflexes but no sensory deficits. Ocular movements were fuli. A few days later the patient suddenly began stuttering. The symptom lasted for a week and then subsided completely. A CT scan was performed and it unexpectedly showed a bilateral paramedian thalamic infarct. A thorough neurological examination was again car- ried out, but no new neurological and neuropsychological deficit was found except for a mild memory impairment, only apparent on formal testing (table 1) and of which he had been aware long before. At follow-up, a year later, relatives reported that the patient slept until 11 am. It is, however, uncertain whether this behaviour was pathological, since he was practically bedridden due to cerebellar gait disorders, and did not com- mit himself to any activity. In all other respects he appeared normal. Case 7 This 73 year old man suddenly complained for 10 minutes of blurring of vision. The next day his wife noticed that he continuously repeated the same question, forgetting Gentilini, De Renzi, Crisi the answer. He also reported events of the recent past that had never happened. Admitted to the ward, neurological examination was unremarkable. Vertical gaze was full. The patient was alert and cooperative and never showed a ten- dency to daytime sleeping. He had, however, a profound memory disorder for recent and past events and showed a marked tendency to confabulate. Occasionally he lost his temper over trivial events and performed strange acts. Once he urinated in a basin and then poured the urine into a bottle of water, justifying his behaviour by saying that he had been requested to keep his urine for examination. In the sub- sequent days his behaviour cleared, but amnesia persisted for the month during which he was hospitalised. He was not available for follow-up. Case 8 This 32 year old woman was a heavy smoker and had been taking the pill for 3 months. She was found, upon awakening, in a drowsy state and confabulating about the events of the previous day. The patient was first admitted to a neurosurgical unit. She was uncooperative, spoke in an incoherent way and was sleepy most of the time, but, when awake, had periods of unrest during which she kept on scratching her breast. A subarachnoid haemorrhage was suspected but not confirmed by a CT scan and lumbar punc- ture. Two weeks later she was transferred to our department. Neurological examination showed a left hemianopia, more =O dense in the upper quadrant, right Babinski s sign, incoor-< f=) dination of right limb movements, nystagmus in the lateral [ ~y gaze position and vertical paresis of saccadic and pursuit 38 movements with preserved oculocephalic reflexes. A mild exophthalmus and midriasis were apparent in the left eye. G She was still disoriented to space and time, hallucinated and gS often failed to answer simple questions. She claimed to be 23 5 years old, to be unmarried and to have no children (she had 2: two) and addressed her husband incorrectly. Language and praxis were unaffected, but she was dysarthric and often spoke in a whisper. A second CT scan, performed 3 weeks after the stroke, showed bilateral, symmetric infarcts of the medial thalamic- hypothalamic region. In addition, there was an infarct in the calcarine territory of the right posterior cerebral artery, which was responsible for her left hemianopia. For the remainder of her hospitalisation, which lasted a month, only 9 a minor improvement in her clinical picture was observed. She remained disoriented, hallucinated and when requested 3. 5 to report family events, she was frequently mixed up. Her > > mood was fickle, showing a tendency to rapidly pass from ~ childish and euphoric manifestations to outbursts of crying and depression. She was amnesic about recent events, but past memory was preserved. Follow-up examination three and a half months after onset showed a substantial improvement of cognitive func- tions, which was confirmed by formal testing (table 1) , but a remarkable deficit of drive and motivation. She was reported by her relatives to be apathetic and idle, to pass most of her time lying down on a sofa watching animated cartoons on TV, and to take no interest in housekeeping. If rebuked for her laziness, she burst into tears, but rapidly fell again into her inert state. She was oriented to space and time, gave sensible answers to common questions and was able, if urged, to do housework, but spontaneously took no ini- tiative. She had only partial insight into the abnormality of her behaviour. Her mother remarked that she would keep on , uul/9gL L'OL Se peysiiqnd ysuy : AuyelyoAsy Binsounay [ounen uno siouel4 2.

The left hemianopia was unchanged, and the vertical movement paresis had only slightly improved. Neuropsychological' examination All patients, with the exception of Patient 5, who died before testing was possible, were given the WAIS and 3 tests of verbal memory about 15 days after onset. The memory tests included immediate and delayed recall of a story, learning a 10 word list and 10 verbal paired-associates. For each test a score discriminating normal from pathological performance has been derived from the administration to 100 normal and 20 amnesic patients. * Table 1 reports the scores achieved by the patients. 1Q was in the normal range in all patients except Patients 4 and 8. These patients were impaired on the first exam- ination, which was carried out 20 days after the stroke and when they were still hypersomnolent; both obtained normal scores when retested 3 months after onset. Only Patient 2 had normal scores on the memory tests. The other six patients were markedly impaired when first examined. Patients 1, 4 and 8 were again tested approximately 3 months after onset: the first still performed poorly on all three tests, the second on story recall only, the third had completely recovered. Table 2 summarises the neurological findings found in the patients. CT scan findings CT was carried out 4 days to 3 months after stroke. In Patients 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 it was performed after intravenous administration of contrast medium. It showed a bilateral infarct in the territory of the paramedian artery in all cases. However, the infarct area was confined to this territory in only one case (No. 3) , while it involved the nuclei supplied by both the paramedian and the polar arteries in all other patients. The extension of the infarct to the territory of the polar artery was bilateral in three cases (Nos. 4, 5 and 7) and unilateral in four cases (Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 8) . The whole hypothalamus-thalamic region was covered by thin CT sec- tions of 6mm each, corresponding to the area from section Hd 0-5 to +9-5 (Plates 51-54) of the Atlas of Schal- tenbrand and Wahren. ?

Discussion There are reports in the literature of 40 cases of bilat- eral paramedian thalamic infarction, documented by necropsy or CT scan: besides those reviewed by Cas- taigne eral' an additional 27 have appeared in the recent literature. 71!~2? By far the largest series is that of Castaigne et al, ! who reported five personal cases with paramedian thalamic infarct and 13 with thalamic-peduncular infarct, verified at necropsy. Although necropsy studies are undoubtedly superior to CT scan studies in terms of accuracy and reliability of lesion assessment, the very fact that they are based on patients who died leads to a biased representation of the clinical picture, which can be better derived from a consecutive series of patients diagnosed on the basis of the CT scan. The symptomatology is rather stereotyped and essentially consists of the following four elements: 1. Disorders of vigilance Stupor or coma of a diencephalic type marked the onset of disease in three patients (Nos. 2, 4 and 5) . This was always associated with vertical gaze paresis and lasted from a few hours to 5 days, giving way progressively to a confusional state. Disorientation to place and time was also apparent in patients who did not lose consciousness, except Patient 6 whose symptoms were amazingly minor. Confusion eventually cleared, while hyper- somnia, which was remarkable in six patients, lasted for weeks or months, with two patients (Nos. 2 and 4) still being hypersomnolent and bedridden for most of yBuAdoo Aq pa}o9}0q auloIpal\\ Jo Aresqr] Aemjunog siouei4 OUL Ye 1Z0% 0% JOQUISAON UO /wWOd\"[wq'duul/: dyYy Woy pepeojumog 2861 Ainr | UO 006'Z'OSduul/9E | LO} Se peysiignd ysuy : Asyeyohsq Hinsounen jouneN J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry: first published as 10. 1136/jnnp. 50. 7. 900 on 1 July 1987.

When in this state, patients could be easily awakened and engaged in conversation and some of them were also able to take mental tests, and to give coherent responses. Left alone, however, they tended to fall asleep again. A marked sleepiness is mentioned in 15 cases in the literature and its presence in a patient with abrupt onset of disease should alert one to the possibility of a bilateral thalamic infarct and prompt the search for other signs. The structures most likely responsible for it are the midline nuclei, ' which represent the rostral extension of the mesencephalic reticular formation. They were damaged in all of our patients, except Patient 6, who never showed disorder of vigilance. 2. Amnesia Memory function could not be assessed in Patient 5, who was in a state of drowsiness and confusion up to the point of dying. Neither clinically nor on formal testing was there any evidence of amnestic decrement in Patient 2. Of the remaining six patients, four (Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 8) were clearly amnesic during the period of hospitalisation, but three recov- ered with passage of time and only one (No. 3) was considered 3 years later to be still impaired by his relatives and the neurologist who examined him. Two other patients (Nos. 4 and 6) did not show definite manifestations of amnesia at bedside examination, but scored in the pathological range on formal memory tests. When retested 18 months later, neither was still impaired. A marked tendency to confabulate was present in Patients 1, 7 and 8, but while in the last two the symp- tom was pure, the systematic and consistent falsification of past and current events shown by the first patient corresponded more to a delusion of gran- deur than to a true confabulation. This impression was confirmed by the persistence of a megalomaniac attitude at a time when amnesia had completely dis- appeared. By and large, an impairment of memory T. mth, mammillothalamic tract; La. m, internal medullary lamina; iodorsal nucleus; Hpth, hypothalamus; F. 1. m, medial longitudinal function appears to be a frequent concomitant of bilateral medial thalamic damage, but it generally tends to subside with passage of time. The thalamic structures that have been implicated in memory function belong to two discrete systems: the anterior nucleus and the mammillo-thalamic tract 2 & on the one hand and the mediodorsal nucleus and \\ the internal medullary lamina, on the other. The ge mammillo-thalamic tract connects the mammillarys O bodies, structures strongly linked with the hippo- o S campus and damaged in patients with Korsakoffs => psychosis, ?> with the anterior nuclei, which in turn@ project to the cingulum. No involvement of anterior o< nuclei has even been reported in paramedian infarctions, while damage to the mammillo-thalamic - tract has been repeatedly emphasised. 1 '!> A strong case for the participation of the mediodorsal nucleus in Korsakoff s psychosis has been made by Victor, Adams and Collins** and further evidence comes from CT scan reconstruction of the lesion in Patient NA?> who developed amnesia after a fencing foil entered rostrally and reached the diencephalic region's (but for a critique see ref 26) . Memory disorders in paramedian infarcts have also been attributed to? damage of the mediodorsal nuclei, '!'!>1 but Von Cramon etal took exception to this view since they found mediodorsal nuclei only marginally encroached upon by the lesion in five patients with amnesia and extensively damaged in two patients without amnesia. Based on CT scan evidence, these authors claimed that the structures always involved by the lesion were the mammillo-thalamic tract and the amygdalo-thalamic projections travelling through the inferior part of the internal medullary lamina. We have attempted to assess in our patients the relation to amnesia of damage to these three thalamic structures, viz the mediodorsal nucleus, the mammillo-thalamic tract and the internal medullary lamina. og duul/ge1 LoL se peysiiqnd ysuy : AuyelyoAsy Binsounayn [ounan M Aemunog s siouel4 In rt S uBukdoo Aq p9}09}01q Ul: UL IE 1Z0Z Oz JeqUaAON UO /WOO\"fwig'duuly: dyY Woy PepeojuMOG \"Z86} Bilateral paramedian thalamic artery infarcts: report of eight cases 907 Table 4 Damage to the structures presumed to play a role in thalamic amnesia Severity of Mediodorsal Mamnillothalamic Internal medullary PtN amnesia nuclei tract lamina 1 A+ Partial, left Bilateral Bilateral 2 A- Partial, left Right Right 3 A+++ a Bilateral ia 4 A+ Partial, bilateral Bilateral Bilateral 6 A+ Extensive, bilateral Left Left 7 At++ Partial, left Bilateral Bilateral 8 A++ Extensive, bilateral Bilateral Right A = noamnesia; A+ = amnesia only apparent on testing; A+ + = amnesia only in the acute stage; A+ + + = long-lasting, severe amnesia. Table 4 summarises the findings. Data of Patient 5 are omitted, because his vigilance was so impaired as to prevent memory evaluation. Our data support Von Cramon etal s claim that the mediodorsal nucleus plays no crucial role in amnesia. Its damage was extensive and bilateral in two patients only, while in four cases it was confined to its outermost ventro- basal part (bilaterally in one patient and unilaterally in three) and the nucleus was completely spared in the patient (No. 3) who had the most severe and long- lasting memory disorder. The internal medullary lamina was apparently intact in this patient, whose infarct destroyed the mammillo-thalamic tract bilat- erally. This structure was involved in all patients, but limited to the right side in the one case (No. 2) , who never showed evidence of amnesia and to the left side in a patient with memory impairment only apparent on formal testing. The internal medullary lamina was affected three times bilaterally and three times uni- laterally. Its apparent sparing in the severely amnestic patient casts doubt on its actual role in memory func- tion. Thus evidence marshalled in the present study points to the mammillo-thalamic tract as the struc- ture responsible for the memory disorders associated with medial thalamic infarcts. No support for the thesis that paramedian thalamic infarcts are associated with dementia! is provided by our patients performance on the WAIS, which was well within the normal range in most cases. The two patients (Nos. 4 and 8) who scored below 90 in the acute stage, had a normal IQ three months later. One should not be deceived by the slowness of response, difficulty with concentration and apathy shown by the patients in the early stage of disease, as they reflect a disorder of vigilance or motivation rather than a true loss of intelligence. 3. Instinct and mood alterations A period of bulimia was evident in four patients (Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 8) . It lasted a few days in Patient 2, two weeks in Patients 3 and 4 and was still present, though to a mild degree, three months after onset in Patient 8. We have found in the literature no mention of this symptom, possibly because it can go unnoticed by the physician unless relatives or nurses are explicitly questioned about it. It is likely dependent upon the encroachment of the lesion on diencephalic structures. Changes of mood were apparent in the majority of testable patients (No. 5 was too drowsy to permit assessment) , and generally consisted of a mixture of irritability and apathy. A few patients were in a chronic bad mood, answered the physician s ques- tions rudely and got angry for trivial reasons. One patient (No. 2) alternated periods of fretfulness with periods of silly cheerfulness, when she ostentatiously kissed and hugged her husband in the presence of other people and indulged in coarse and inap- propriate jokes about the physicians. In Patient 1 the affective tone tended towards euphoria in agreement with the ideational contents of his thought, where boasts of wealth, power and mastery of foreign lan- guages recurred. 4. Vertical gaze paresis was present in five patients (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8) . In Cases 1, 5 and 8, both upwards and downwards saccadic and pursuit move- ments were absent; Case 2 had a restricted upwards gaze and a normal downwards gaze; Case 4 had an absent upwards gaze and a restricted downwards gaze. The supranuclear nature of the disorder was demonstrated by the integrity of vertical oculo- cephalic movements. Involvement of the pretectal region close to the posterior commissure and in par- ticular of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, located above the oculomotor nuclei, is at present considered the most likely cause of Parinaud s syndrome. This region has been found damaged in seven cases of bilateral paramedian thal- amopeduncular infarct??? showing various combi- nations of upward and downward gaze paresis, four of whom? could be verified at necropsy. In our series the rostral part of the medial longitudinal fasciculus was marginally damaged in two patients (Nos. 5 and 8) and intact in the remaining three with vertical gaze paresis. The oculomotor disorder was thus likely due to the involvement of the frontofugal dorsothalamic yBuAdoo Aq pa}o9}0q auloIpal\\ Jo Aresqr] Aemjunog siouei4 OUL Ye 1Z0% 0% JOQUISAON UO /wWOd\"[wq'duul/: dyYy Woy pepeojumog 2861 Ainr | UO 006'Z'OSduul/9E | LO} Se peysiignd ysuy : Asyeyohsq Hinsounen jouneN 908 bundle traversing the mediodorsal nucleus and the internal medullary lamina in its way to the superior colliculus? and possibly also of the efferents from the superior colliculus to the rostral interstitial nucleus. Concluding remarks The clinical picture presented by patients with bilat- eral medial thalamic infarcts lends itself to diagnostic errors if this aetiology is not kept in mind. The sudden onset of a stuporous or comatose state, in the absence of motor deficits, easily evokes the idea of a sub- arachnoid haemorrhage and this was in fact the first diagnosis entertained in some of our cases. In other patients the outstanding symptom was the alteration of behaviour, which manifested itself as disori- entation to space and time, with memory loss or thought disorders, that is a picture suggestive of a metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. The symptom that is at most suggestive of the thalamo-subthalamic localisation of the lesion is vertical gaze paresis, but it was present in only five cases and can be overlooked in the early days of disease when the patient s cooper- ation is poor. Aphasia and hemi-inattention, which have been repeatedly reported following strokes lat- eralised to the left and right thalamus, respectively, were not observed either in the present series or in the great majority of comparable cases in the literature, and this points to their dependence on the involvement of other thalamic nuclei. The distinction between polar and paramedian artery infarcts, which is predicted by anatomical stud- ies, is often blurred by the simultaneous involvement of both territories. Although the reconstruction of lesion boundaries by means of CT scan findings has obvious limitations, the present data indicate that in seven of eight cases the infarct extended to the area of supply of the polar artery. The variability in the extension of lesion may account for some of the differences found in the clinical picture. The prognosis of this kind of infarct is neither severe nor good: only one patient died and a certain degree of recovery occurred in the majority of those who survived. Both memory deficits and hypersomnia subsided to a considerable extent, if not completely, in the majority of patients. In addition vertical gaze paresis tended to improve and never seriously dis- turbed the patient s activities. Yet none of the patients who were followed-up for more than a year returned to normal behaviour: Patient 1 is still prey to his delusional fancies, Patient 2 continues to suffer from somnolence and depression, Patient 3 is profoundly amnesic, Patient 4 tends to fall asleep if he is not engaged in some activity, and Patient 6 is practically bedridden (although, probably, because of an additional disease) .

        "case_report": "CASE REPORT Left Dorsomedial Thalamic Damage Impairs Verbal Recall More Than Recognition: A Case Report Massimiliano Ruggeri, PhD Abstract: Damage to the dorsomedial thalamus usually leads to impaired episodic memory, attention, and executive function, but the role of the dorsomedial thalamus in memory processing is still not fully understood. Clinical evidence is inconclusive about whether dorsomedial thalamic damage impairs recall or whether it impairs recognition. I report a unique patient who suffered a cardioembolic stroke in the paramedian artery terri- tory, caused by a patent foramen ovale. He was left with a chronic ischemic lesion centered in the parvocellular and, to a lesser extent, the magnocellular portions of the left dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, and marginally involving the midline and in- tralaminar nuclei. A year after the stroke, the patient s neuro- psychological assessment showed a selective verbal memory deficit with greater loss of recall than recognition. His memory was normal when he was given semantically encoded material. His test results showed that damage to the left dorsomedial thalamic nucleus might affect both his recall and recognition because of the involvement of the parvocellular and magnocel- lular portions, respectively. The results also suggest that the left dorsomedial thalamus is involved in the encoding of verbal material. This case report highlights the role that the left dor- somedial thalamus plays in processing memory specific to verbal material. The findings point to the differential contribution of the dorsomedial parvocellular nucleus to recall, and support the theory that prefrontal strategic memory is enabled by thalamic-prefrontal diaschisis. Few case reports have presented a circumscribed lesion of the left dorsomedial thalamus (Carlesimo et al, 2015; Pergola and Suchan, 2013) , and, to my knowledge, none of these previous studies revealed a selective deficit of verbal recall with mild impairment of recognition. I report a patient with a chronic lacunar infarction of the left dorsomedial thalamus after a cardioembolic stroke caused by a patent foramen ovale. The lesion was centered in the DMpce portion and, to a lesser extent, in the DMmce. Because of the DMpc-DLPFC connectivity, one would expect this patient s recall to be more impaired than his recognition. I gave him a neuropsychological assessment to evaluate and compare his recall and recognition. To investigate his encoding processes, I gave him semantically related and unrelated verbal memory tests. CASE REPORT The patient was a right-handed 50-year-old man with a high school education. He took no medications and had no history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. He worked for a technology company. When the patient woke up one morning, his wife noticed that he had gait and balance disturbances, was confused, and showed paraphasic speech. On admission to the local hospital, he was confused and somnolent, Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Dorsomedial Thalamic Damage Impairs Recall More Than Recognition with mild aphasia and weakness of his right arm and hand. A computed tomogram of the brain and an elec- troencephalogram were negative. A magnetic resonance imaging scan 24 hours after onset showed a small ische- mic lesion in the left medial thalamus. A magnetic reso- nance angiogram and a carotid and vertebral Doppler examination were also normal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale, for which the patient underwent successful surgery a few weeks later. Over the following weeks, he recovered completely from his speech and motor disturbances. Neuroradiologic Follow-Up at 1 Year A year after the stroke, a 1. 5-Tesla magnetic reso- nance imaging scan revealed a selective lacunar infarction in the paramedian artery territory, involving the inferior and anterior part of the left medial thalamus (Figure 1) . I schematically reconstructed the lesion, outlining its pro- file on coronal and axial images taken from an atlas of the human thalamus (Morel et al, 1997) (Figure 2) . I identi- fied the atlas images that most closely corresponded with the patient s available magnetic resonance imaging scans, following the procedure described by Benke (2003) . I used the corresponding horizontal planes taken from the atlases available online at BrainInfo (http: //braininfo. rpre. washington. edu) . The lesion involved the inferior and anterior part of the left dorsomedial nucleus, in both its parvocellular and, to a lesser extent, magnocellular portions. The damage extended only marginally to some midline and intralaminar nuclei, specifically to portions of the central medial, center median, and parafascicular nuclei. The anterior nucleus was spared. The mammillothalamic tract, which was adjacent to the lesion, appeared un- damaged. Neuropsychological Assessment at 1 Year At | year, the patient was referred to me for neu- ropsychological assessment because he was complaining of mild memory problems in his everyday life and felt that he needed to write in a diary to aid his memory. At that time he had no motor or speech dis- turbances. He was attentive and well oriented to time and place. He had returned to his job. His emotional and behavioral functions were normal, and he took no psy- chotropic medication. I evaluated the patient in four weekly 60-minute sessions at our Rehabilitation Center. He completed all of the tests with adequate motivation and cooperation. Using Italian versions of the assessment tools, I tested his attention and working memory with Visual Search (Spinnler and Tognoni, 1987) , the Trail Making Test Part A (Giovagnoli et al, 1996) , and the Paced Au- ditory Serial Addition Test 2 seconds (Goretti et al, 2014) (Table 1) . I tested his verbal short-term memory with the Digit Span Forward and Backward (Orsini and Laicardi, 2003) . I tested his executive functions with the Trail Making Test Part B (Giovagnoli et al, 1996) , Raven www. cogbehavneurol. com | 159 Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

I assessed the patient s visuospatial long-term memory with the Corsi Supra-Span Block-Tapping Test (Spinnler and Tognoni, 1987) , in which the participant is given up to 18 tries to recall an eight-block sequence immediately, followed by a 10-minute delayed recall; I also gave him the delayed recall of the Rey-Osterrieth figure (Caffarra et al, 2002) . I investigated the patient s encoding processes by comparing his recall of semantically related versus un- related verbal material. For this purpose, I gave him the Semantically Related and Unrelated Words Learning test (Mauri et al, 1997) and the Paired-Associate Learning test Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. (Novelli et al, 1986) . Neither of these instruments had been given to patients in previous case studies of dorso- medial thalamic injury. The Semantically Related and Unrelated Words Learning test follows the procedure of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, but contains two lists composed, respectively, of 16 related words belonging to four cate- gories, and 16 unrelated words. The Paired-Associate Learning test requires the participant to learn five pairs of related words (eg, fish and sea) and five pairs of unrelated words (eg, bridge and wine) , and to complete three im- mediate recall trials in which the first word of a pair is presented and the participant recalls the associated word. www. cogbehavneurol. com | 161 Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Cogn Behav Neurol * Volume 29, Number 3, September 2016 I divided the verbal memory tests over the four testing sessions to avoid interference: Session 1: Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Paired- Associate Learning, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Digit Span Session 2: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Raven Progressive Matrices 47, Visual Search, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, Corsi Supra-Span Session 3: Semantically Related Words Learning, Wechs- ler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Comprehension, Phonetic Verbal Fluency Session 4: Semantically Unrelated Words Learning, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Short Story, Oral Naming Non-interfering tests or short rest periods filled the intervals between the immediate and delayed recall trials. Since I did not have a matched group of healthy controls, I compared the patient s scores with the published standardized norms of the Italian versions of the tests. Those normative data were based on very large groups of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education. RESULTS The patient s neuropsychological assessment showed normal performance on the tests of attention, anguage, and executive functions (Table 1) . His perfor- mance on the verbal memory tests was below normal imits, while his visuospatial memory was preserved. His story recall was defective, but without confabulation. His immediate recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was mildly impaired (in the fifth trial he recalled seven of the 15 words) , with a recency effect and poor semantic clustering strategies; his delayed recall was more impaired (only two of the 15 words) . His recog- nition trial was slightly defective (87% correct responses) , but his recognition with visual stimuli (faces and pictures yes/no recognition subtests of the Rivermead Test) was normal. He showed no intrusion errors in either recall or recognition. He had impaired recall of the Semantically Un- related word list: In the fifth trial he recalled six of the 16 words, with a recency effect, and only one word in the delayed recall. The recognition trial was normal (88% correct responses) . By contrast, he had normal immediate and delayed recall of the Semantically Related word list, although his semantic clustering strategies were still poor (in the fifth trial he could cluster words belonging to only one of the four categories) . The recognition trial showed mild deficits (72% correct responses) . In the Paired- Associate Learning test, he could not recall any seman- tically unrelated word-pairs during the three trials, although he could recall all the semantically associated pairs. DISCUSSION My patient had a unique chronic ischemic lesion centered in the left dorsomedial thalamus. The lesion in- volved portions of the DMpe; to a lesser extent, the Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Dorsomedial Thalamic Damage Impairs Recall More Than Recognition DMme; and, marginally, the midline and intralaminar nuclei. The anterior nucleus and the mammillothalamic tract were spared. A year after his stroke, the patient showed a selective verbal memory deficit with impairment These findings suggest that damage to the DMpc thalamus affects recall more than recognition. The find- ings seem to support the involvement of the DMpc in recall and of the DMmce in recognition, both of them through the dual thalamocortical functional connectivity of the dorsomedial thalamus (Carlesimo et al, 2015; Pergola and Suchan, 2013) . The DMpc is functionally connected to the DLPFC and plays a role in relational memory, specifically, the encoding and retrieval processes of the relational aspects of the information; damage to the DMpce should affect recall and recollection more than recognition (Pergola et al, 2012, 2013) . The DMmc is principally connected to medial temporal regions, and involved in the consolidation of memory traces, thus promoting familiarity and recognition (Montaldi et al, 2006) . My patient s lesion involved the DMpc portion to a greater extent than the DMmc portion. Accordingly, his recall was more impaired than his recognition, suggesting that his DMpc-DLPFC circuitry was probably more se- riously affected. This finding is also supported by a recent case-series study of 12 patients, the largest group with well- documented isolated dorsomedial thalamic lesions ever reported (Danet et al, 2015) . The patients with DMpec thalamic damage but an intact mammillothalamic tract showed deficits in recall of verbal single items, but with preserved recognition memory, resembling my patient s memory disorders. The patient s normal memory performance with semantically associated material but his poor semantic clustering strategies suggest an impairment in the non- automatic and more complex encoding strategies of ver- bal single items. This finding is also supported by pre- vious functional neuroimaging studies showing activation of the left dorsomedial thalamus and DLPFC during the encoding of verbal material (Blumenfeld et al, 2011; Pergola et al, 2013) . My results also suggest the possibility hat this circuitry is not involved in simple semantic or- ganization, as evidenced in previous studies with the ob- ject-recall-from-features paradigm (Assaf et al, 2006) . Still, this circuitry might subserve the processing of more complex semantic organization of hard related in- ormation, through the encoding and binding of various object features for an integrated object memory (Pergola et al, 2012) . This hypothesis needs further investigation. In view of my results, I propose that my patient s mai ipsilateral (Alexander et al, 1986; Burruss et al, 2000) . Furthermore, the dissociation between the patient s impaired verbal memory and spared visuospatial memory www. cogbehavneurol. com | 163 Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Ruggeri is supported by previous findings of material-specific ef- fect after a unilateral thalamic lesion (Edelstyn et al, 2012) . The patient s preserved attention and executive and behavioral functions suggest that damage to dorso- medial nuclei is not sufficient in itself to cause executive disturbances, and damage to the midline and intralaminar nuclei is not enough to cause disorders of arousal and attention (Van der Werf et al, 2003b) . However, despite the patient s normal performance on traditional tests of attention, subtle impairments in his attention under conditions of high demand might have contributed in part to his memory disturbance (Edelstyn et al, 2014) . This study has some limitations. First, I could not recruit a group of healthy controls matched to the patient for age, sex, and intelligence quotient. Second, because the patient did not undergo diffusion tensor imaging, I could not completely rule out the possibility that his le- sion marginally involved the mammillothalamic tract, which could have contributed to his impaired recall. This concern seems irrelevant to my patient, however, since he did not evidence severe amnesia, which is the usual result of mammillothalamic tract damage and the consequent disruption of the hippocampal-thalamic axis (Aggleton and Brown, 1999; Danet et al, 2015) . These findings do not fit the dual framework (two parallel brain systems with differential contributions to anterograde memory) originally proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999) , but they do seem to add further evi- dence for a differentiated involvement of the dorsomedial halamus in memory processing (Aggleton et al, 2011; Pergola and Suchan, 2013) . My results support a role for the left dorsomedial thalamic subregions in processing verbal material-specific recall and recognition. My findings point in particular to he differential contribution of the left DMpc thalamus to recall, thus supporting the theory that prefrontal strategic memory is enabled by adequate encoding of information hrough dorsomedial thalamocortical connectivity with he DLPFC.

According to their hypothesis, subserving recall and recollection is the extended hippocampal system, made up of the hippocampus, fornix, mammillary bodies, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Contrib- uting mainly to familiarity and recognition memory is the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, which has direct connections with the perirhinal cortex via the ventral amygdalofugal pathway and the inferior thalamic peduncle. As reported by Carlesimo et al (2015) and Pergola and Suchan (2013) , lesions of the dorsomedial thalamus are often associated with impaired recall and recollection, suggesting that the dorsomedial thalamus is not a func- tionally homogeneous structure. Indeed, the parvocellular portion of the dorsomedial nucleus (DMpc) is function- ally connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) , and primarily involved in recall- and recollection-based recognition. The magnocellular por- tion (DMmc) is connected with the perirhinal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, and is mainly involved in familiarity-based recognition (Carlesimo et al, 2015; Pergola and Suchan, 2013) . In an extensive review of the literature on the con- tributions of the diencephalon to recognition memory, Aggleton and colleagues (2011) revisited their 1999 model and proposed instead a multi-effect multi-nuclei model. Here they hypothesized that a balanced action of the dorsomedial and the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei is required for both recollection- and familiarity- based recognition. Edelstyn et al (2014) and Van der Werf et al (2002, 2003b) also studied the role of the midline and intralaminar nuclei, and concluded that these nuclei re- ceive extensive brainstem innervation from the reticular formation, they activate the prefrontal cortex, and they play a principal role in arousal, high-demand attentional processes, and executive functions.

Cogn Behav Neurol * Volume 29, Number 3, September 2016 In summary, a long-running debate continues over whether the dorsomedial thalamus contributes to memory processing in recall and recollection or in familiarity and recognition. Contributions to recall and recollection are supported by the connectivity of the DMpe with the DLPFC (Pergola et al, 2012) , and, therefore, also depend on executive functions (Van der Werf et al, 2003b) and are modulated by high-demand attentional processes mediated by the midline and intralaminar nuclei (Edelstyn et al, 2014) . Contributions to familiarity and recognition are supported by the familiarity circuit: the DMme, perirhinal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (Aggleton and Brown, 1999; Montaldi et al, 2006) . Clinical evidence is also equivocal regarding the contribution of the dorsomedial thalamus to the encoding or retrieval phase of memory processing. Van der Werf et al (2003a) proposed that the dorsomedial nucleus is involved in strategic retrieval, while Pergola et al (2013) concluded that this nucleus contributes to both encoding and retrieval. This uncertainty in the literature probably arises from several confounding factors that make it difficult to identify specific structure-function relationships in the thalamic nuclei. First, dorsomedial thalamic damage usually also involves adjacent thalamic and extrathalamic structures sharing the same vascular territories; the most important of these structures are the anterior thalamic nuclei and the mammillothalamic tract, which are part of the extended hippocampal system. A second confounding factor is suboptimal neuroimaging resolution. A third is et al. 2006. Neural correlates of the object-recall process in semantic memory. Psychiatry Res. 147: 115-126.

We report this phenomenon in a 33 yr-old, right-handed man (JG) in association with the extension in the right thalamus of a previously small, bilateral thalamic lesion. JG presented with a dense amnesia for autobiographical material more than a few years old, with some sparing of recent memories. Furthermore, he was completely unable to recognise famous people or world events. Many other aspects of semantic knowledge were intact and there was no evidence of general intellectual impairment, executive dysfunction or loss of visual imagery. the right thalamus and two small, symmetrical, bilateral non-acute thalamic lesions. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment indicated a stable pattern of impaired retrograde and spared anterograde memory over 18 months and psychiatric assessments yielded no evidence of confabulation, malingering or other symptoms to suggest psychogenic amnesia. JG s profile indicates that the division of declarative memory into just two categories episodic and semantic is inadequate. Rather, his case adds to the growing body evidence to suggest that world knowledge pertaining to people and events is stored or accessed similarly to autobiographical information and differently from other types of more general factual knowledge. We hypothesize that the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and immediately surrounding regions comprise the central processing mechanism referred to by McClelland (Revue Neurologique, 150 (1994) 570) and Markowitsch (Brain Research Review, 21 (1995) 117) as responsible for inducing and co-ordinating the recall of these sorts of cortically stored memory engrams. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction loss of past memories has always occurred together with an anterograde memory deficit, a precise role for Retrograde amnesia occurring together with antero- grade amnesia has been noted after thalamic injury [88], infarction [4, 16, 31, 36, 42, 71, 90, 97], in Wernicke Kor- sakoff syndrome, which involves the thalamus [11, 38, 59, 96], and in transient global amesia, where right thalamic hypometabolism has been noted on PET scanning [5]. Because, in previously reported cases, the * Corresponding author. Tel. : + 1-612-95157816; fax: + 1-612- 95157474. E-mail address: \\amiller@mail. usyd. edu. au (L. A. Miller) . the thalamus in retrograde memory has yet to be defined. Here we present, for the first time, a case of isolated retrograde amnesia associated with a well- defined thalamic lesion. This case has significant impli- cations both for the organisation of memory and for the neural circuitry involved in mnestic function. Significant and persistent retrograde amnesia without an anterograde memory impairment has been reported in a small number of patients with circumscribed dam- age, either to the frontal lobes [19, 21] or to the poste- rior cingulate gyrus and/or retrosplenial region [30, 44, 57, 73]. In other cases where this phenomenon 0028-3932/01/$ - see front matter 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. PII: $0028-3932 (01) 00041-0 1038 L. A. Miller et al. / Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1037-1046 has been observed, there has been more diffuse damage resulting from trauma or encephalitis [12, 14, 20, 48, 55, 62, 89, 91, 100]. In most of these cases, there has been additional cognitive compromise resulting in attri- bution of the retrograde memory disorder to the sec- ondary effects of disorganized retrieval strategies, impaired visual imaging, and/or a tendency to con- fabulate. In the context of organic brain damage, retrograde amnesia is usually time-limited with a temporal gradi- ent, such that the patient is better at recalling the more distant past than the more recent ([1, 19, 82, 89]) . The finding that retrograde amnesia after mesial temporal lobe damage extends backward in time for several years ([18, 66, 81]) gave rise to the proposal that memories are consolidated via the hippocampal region over a period of years [86]. This consolidation period is thought to be followed by storage of memories in diffuse cortical networks, independent of the hippocampal system ([68]) . The fact that there are a number of patients with both anterograde and extensive retrograde memory im- pairment, but without other cognitive deficits to indi- cate widespread cortical dysfunction [20, 23, 31, 72, 98], suggests that in some cases, retrograde amnesia may result from blocked access to stored memories rather than from a destruction of diffusely stored representa- tions. A role for the thalamus in coordinating and controlling the large scale cortical networks involved in conscious recollection has been put forward [9, 39, 61]. In patients with retrograde memory loss, the degree of impairment may differ according to type of to-be-re- membered material. In some patients who were unable to recall autobiographical information, there was relative sparing of factual world knowledge [27, 41, 42, 55, 57, 94], whereas the reverse pattern has also been documented [22, 32, 35, 49]. These dissociations sup- port cognitive theories that divide declarative memory processes into those involving semantic knowledge ver- sus those involving episodic information ([{11, 78, 86, 93]) . Markowitsch [61] has proposed that left sided lesions are more likely to cause deficient recall from the seman- tic knowledge system, whereas right sided brain lesions are particularly likely to disrupt autobiographical or episodic memory. There have also been some cases to indicate that dissociations in the ability to access differ- ent types of semantic knowledge can occur ([40, 42]) . It is not yet clear in what these differences consist, or whether such dissociations depend on lesion location. In most patients with retrograde amnesia, procedural knowledge is thought to be preserved [48, 62]. This aspect of memory for the past is often underexplored in amnesic patients, however, and there is at least one description of procedural knowledge being lost along with other types of memories by a patient with retro- grade amnesia [64]. Although rarely seen in association with a focal brain lesion, a profound and isolated inability to recall past events is one of the most common presentations of simulated and psychogenic amnesia [56]. Psychogenic (or dissociative) amnesia is conceptualised as an amne- sia of unconscious but psychological origin and is defined in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (p. 478) [24] as an inability to recall important personal information, usu- ally of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The disorder is not due to the direct physiological effects of. . . a neurological or other general medical condition. Recently, however, Kapur [47] has sug- gested that psychogenic amnesia can sometimes accom- pany a neurological disorder and he proposed a number of features to help distinguish psychogenic from organic retrograde amnesia. Here we report a case of isolated retrograde amnesia following the extension of a previously asymptomatic, small bilateral thalamic lesion into the right medial thalamic region. In this patient, the amnesia affected memory for autobiographical information, and some aspects of procedural memory, as well as knowledge of famous people and famous events. Other aspects of semantic knowledge were spared. Strikingly, other areas of cognition including anterograde memory, frontal lobe functioning and visual imagery were intact. There were no indications from the patient s background to suggest a psychogenic cause to the disorder and, 18 months after its onset, the condition remains stable, with no secondary gains having emerged. The case thus provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of the thalamus in the retrieval of stored memories. 2. Case presentation JG was a 33 yr-old, right handed tradesman who presented with amnesia and disorientation. Ten days prior to his admission, he had developed a sore throat associated with coughing, sneezing and rhinorrhoea. Two days prior to admission, he became somnolent and difficult to rouse. On 29 July, 1998, JG woke complain- ing of a headache but showered and readied himself for work as usual. As he parted company with his wife, he stopped to ask her where he was working, and what he was supposed to be doing there. When she replied he appeared quite confused and was briefly tearful, saying T m so sorry, I don t remember anything! He was taken to his general practitioner who noted that he professed almost no knowledge of his past life. The doctor arranged hospital admission that same day. On admission, JG was alert and had few complaints. He was neither depressed nor anxious although he seemed mildly perplexed by his memory loss. He knew L. A. Miller et al. / Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1037-1046 1039 his name and date of birth, but did not know a number of other things about himself (e. g. , whether he smoked) . He did not know the year or the day. He had no recollection of two overseas trips taken during the previous year and was unable to say how they had celebrated his own or his wife s last birthdays. On further questioning, it became clear that he was unable to remember anything of his life in England (he had immigrated to Australia in 1993) . For example, he could not give his parents names, describe any aspect of his childhood or remember any details of his school- ing. His last memory was of going to bed five days earlier and, when questioned, he thought that his cur- rent contract tradesman job was at a site where he had actually been working months earlier. In contrast to his poor retrograde memory, JG showed normal day-to- day anterograde memory. For example, a few days after admission, he was able to describe in detail the cerebral angiogram that he had undergone the previous day. This profound and pervasive retrograde amnesia as- sociated with very good day-to-day memory suggested psychogenic or simulated amnesia, so a formal psychi- atric review was conducted. This revealed no evidence of a disturbance of mood, thought form or thought content. JG s general health was good. According to his wife, he smoked ten cigarettes per day and took modest amounts of alcohol. He used no illicit drugs. There was no personal or family history of migraine or psychiatric illness. His wife knew of no significant personal or financial stress. Formal psychiatric review was repeated on two occasions over the 18 months post-discharge. JG became mildly depressed and was treated success- fully with Zoloft. At no time did he show evidence of malingering, confabulation or other significant psychopathology. On neurological examination at the time of admis- sion, JG s fine finger movements on the left were found to be clumsy. Laboratory investigations revealed a mild lymphopaenia (1. 16 x 10 /l; N= 1. 5 4. 0 x 10 /l) , con- sistent with viral infection and which returned to nor- mal within two days. All other routine haematological and biochemical investigations were normal. The results of extensive investigations for the causes of stroke in a young person were negative. JG s wife told us that over a few days in 1996 he had manifested similar symptoms. At that time he had been irritable, tearful (which was very out of character) , forgetful and difficult to rouse, in association with flu-like symptoms. When we asked about JG s memory over the intervening 2 yr, his wife felt that there had never been any problem that compared to the one that he had developed recently. For example, no retrograde memory problems were noticed when he went home to England in 1997. 3. Neuroradiological findings Computed tomographic (CT) scanning was carried out upon admission. This was initially reported as normal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, first car- ried out on 30/7/98, revealed a bilateral (right > left) mesial thalamic lesion. In retrospect, this lesion could be seen on the CT scan as well. Higher quality MR images (as shown in Fig. 1) were obtained in April, 1999. There was no change in the lesion size or distribu- tion between the two MR scans. We use terminology from the Mai et al. [58] brain atlas to describe the thalamic nuclei in this paper. The MR scans demonstrated three areas of abnormal signal intensity in the thalami, two on the right and one on the left (Fig. 1) . Only the more anterior lesion on the right had poorly defined borders and was thought to have occurred recently. This lesion involved the lat- erodorsal, ventroanterior, ventrolateral anterior, ven- trointermedius, reticular, and dorsal part of the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei as well as the internal medullary lamina and part of the mammillothalamic tract. The second, more posterior area of abnormal signal on the right involved the posterior part of the mediodorsal nucleus, the centromedian, ventrolateral posterior, ventroposterior medial and parafascicular nuclei as well as the ventral internal medullary lamina and anterior tip of the medial pulvinar. Third, in the left thalamus, there was a small area of high signal intensity involving the posterior part of the mediodor- sal nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus, as well as the posterior part of the internal medullary lamina and i > z Fig. 1.

The latter two regions were quite well defined and appeared to be of slightly higher signal intensity than the more anterior component on the right. Their appearance was judged to be nonacute. The estimated volume of the total lesion in the right thalamus was 772 mm? and on the left it was 72 mm*. The mammillary bodies, anterior principal nuclei and fornices appeared normal bilater- ally and showed no evidence of atrophy. Selective cere- bral angiography was performed and was found to be normal. The thalamic lesions were thought most likely to be the result of infarction. The findings suggested at least two episodes. The major radiological differential diag- nosis was demyelination, but the distribution of the lesions was considered to be quite atypical and there was no evidence of lesions involving the corpus callo- sum. Recently, however, a case of encephalomyelitis affecting the thalamus has been described [74] and this aetiology must be considered a possibility. 4. Neuropsychological assessments 4. 1. Initial assessment (1 day, 5 days and 3 months following admission) On formal testing, JG s autobiographical memory was exceptionally poor (Table 1) . On the autobiograph- ical memory interview [53], his recall (both of semantic recall. For example, he could remember the date of his wedding 5 yr earlier and some details of the occasion. He was also able to recall a number of details of games played by England in the Football World Cup in June, 1998. To assess JG s ability to recognise autobiographical material, three multiple choice tests were created from information and photographs supplied by his mother, sister and wife. JG gave his informed consent to partic- ipate in these experiments. Events) , there were 18 questions about his previous life (e. g. , name of former fianc e, place where he had his first job, school sport in which he had won prizes) , each with four possible responses. In a second, two-step test involving personally familiar faces from the past, 29 photographs of faces of friends and relatives from Australia (9 recent ?) and England (20 remote from 7-25 yr ago) were first presented one at a time amongst the photographs of three strangers. JG had to pick the face that was familiar. In the second part of this test, he was asked to match each photograph of his friends or family members to one of four Christian names. As can be seen in Table 1, with the exception of his perfor- Table 1 Autobiographical retrograde memory tests: initial and 12-month fol- low-up scores Measure Initial Follow-up Standardised measure Autobiographical memory interview Personal semantic information Childhood 2. 5/21* 0/21 Early adult 7. 5/21 11. 5/21* Recent 9/218 21/21 Total 19/63* 32. 5/63* Autobiographical incidents.

JG s retrograde memory for some aspects of non-au- tobiographical information was also profoundly im- paired. During his hospital admission, JG could not recognise ten famous people (e. g. , Margaret Thatcher) either from their names or their pictures. Three months following his admission, JG s knowledge of famous people and world events was tested in more detail using new tests of famous people and famous events designed to be appropriate to his cultural background and age. For the Famous People test, there were three parts, one involving 30 famous faces, one involving 60 famous names and one in which the original 30 famous faces were re-presented with choices of famous names. For the most part, the famous people were alive and very much a part of current popular culture (e. g. , Bill Clin- ton, Nicole Kidman) , but some were well-known figures from the past (e. g. , Adolph Hitler, Albert Einstein) . On the Famous Events test, there were 32 items (e. g. , What happened at Lockerbie, Scotland?) pertaining to events from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. For each of these tests, the correct answer was presented amongst three distractors and a forced choice procedure was used. JG s scores on these new experimental measures were compared with those of three men with no known L. A. Miller et al. / Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1037-1046 1041 neurological disorders, and from whom written consent was obtained. The study was approved by the Central Sydney Area Health Service Ethics Committee. These subjects were matched to JG for their country of origin (Great Britain) , years of living in Australia (range = 2 7 yr) , age (range = 29-34 yr) and estimated Full Scale IQ from the National Adult Reading Test [69] (range = 94-102) . Results are presented in Fig. 2. On all of these measures, JG performed at near-chance levels. For famous people, he showed true recognition (i. e. , choose the face, identify the profession and match the correct name) for only 4/30 and all four of these were people who had received ongoing media attention in the three months between the time of his retrograde memory loss and the time of testing. There was no difference be- tween his ability to recognise the names or faces of people from before his life time and those of people who were famous during his life. In light of the patchy recall he demonstrated for recent autobiographical events, it is interesting to note that on the famous world events test, JG showed no sign of spared memory for events from any period in his life. Other aspects of JG s semantic knowledge were in- tact.

Similarly, his performance on a range of anterograde memory tests, including measures of both learning and delayed recall for visual as well as verbal material fell within two standard deviations of the normal mean for his age (Table 2) . As can be seen in Table 2, JG s attention, speed of processing, and problem solving were intact. Perfor- mance on the Wisconsin card sorting test [8, 33], the Trail Making Test [2] and verbal fluency (Controlled oral word association test [85]) also fell within normal limits; thus, there was no evidence of executive dysfunc- tion. In addition, JG performed normally on tests of visual imagery, including measures that asked him to make judgements concerning the shapes of letters [17], the shapes and sizes of objects [25, 54] or the length of different animals tails (Martha Farah, personal com- munication) . He showed no problems with face percep- tion in that he could easily match pictures of faces when a target was presented amongst distractors on the facial recognition test [6, 7]. 4. 2. Follow-up assessment At the time of writing, 18 months after his hospital admission, JG continued to display normal memory for day-to-day events, but severe problems with retrograde memory. He reported that over the intervening months, he had returned to previously frequented sites (e. g. , a golf course on which he had played several times, old work sites) and found them unrecognisable. He had to re-learn the routes to previously familiar places. When tested at 12 months follow-up, his neuropsychological profile on standardised testing remained remarkably stable (second column of Table 2) , with some improve- ment on word fluency. With regard to autobiographical material, at 12 months follow-up, JG s recall of personal events and semantic details from childhood and young adulthood had not changed significantly on the Autobiographical Memory Interview (second column of Table 1) . Only for the most recent period of his life did his scores fall within normal limits on this test, which was to be expected as he could draw on material he had experi- enced or re-learned in the past year. On multiple choice testing, he remained largely unable to recognise person- ally relevant details of his life or familiar faces from the more distant past. JG s recognition of famous people improved some- what by the second assessment, which was not surpris- ing given his good anterograde memory and the fact that a number of the faces were very much a part of popular culture over the intervening year. For several of the faces that he was now able to identify, he could say where he had learned the information over the past year. In spite of this improvement, only his ability to pick out which face was famous (77% correct) im- 1042 L. A.

He continued to demonstrate a significant impairment on the recogni- of names to faces (80% correct) . Furthermore, no im- provement was evident in his ability to recognise de- 4. 3. Procedural memory Much of JG s long-standing procedural knowledge was intact. For example, when he left the hospital, he was able to drive and he knew how to play golf and billiards. When he returned to work four weeks later, he knew how to use his trade equipment. However, JG could not access some aspects of his prior procedural knowledge. He was uncertain as to which was his side of the bed. He had to re-learn how to use the cash register at the shop where he had worked for a few weeks prior to his admission and a coffee machine that he d been using for about six weeks. Of interest, JG s wife commented that he failed to recognise or appreci- ate music that he had previously enjoyed. 5. Discussion JG is the first patient in whom isolated retrograde amnesia has been documented following a circum- scribed thalamic lesion. Other aspects of JG s cognition including his attention, executive functioning, word finding ability and visual imagery were intact and thus could not be said to have contributed to his inability to access remote memories. According to Kapur s [47] criteria, there were few aspects of JG s presentation to suggest simulated or psychogenic amnesia. The lack of an acute psychosocial stress, the persistence of the disorder and the presence of demonstrable thalamic lesions were all inconsistent L. A. Miller et al. / Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1037-1046 1043 with the diagnosis of psychogenic amnesia. Further- more, there was no apparent benefit to him from the patient role and neither extensive questioning of his family nor the passage of time has revealed circum- stances that could be associated with malingering. The MR images yielded evidence of at least two neurological events in the thalamus, with the more recent involving the medial region on the right side and the older incident (s) involving posteromedial regions bilaterally. The lesions lie in the territory of the thalam- operforate (also known as the paramedian) arteries. JG s wife gav mild mood changes, somnolence, and memory prob- lems occurring 2 yr prior to the present event. In light of the radiological findings, we believe that those symp- toms were probably associated with an earlier episode of damage to the thalamus. It is important to note that the onset of JG s dense and persistent retrograde amne- sia occurred only after the second episode, which in- volved extension of the lesion into more anterodorsal thalamic regions on the right, including the mammillo- thalamic tract, internal medullary lamina and anterodorsal part of the dorsomedial nucleus. The anteromesial portion of the thalamus has rich projections to the frontal and temporal lobes and exten- sive hypometabolism has been found in these cortical areas as a consequence of a mediodorsal thalamic le- sion [76]. A number of investigators [3, 45, 61, 67, 83, 99] have proposed that Thus, one might argue that JG s memory deficit is the result not of thalamic dys- function per se, but of diminished functioning in these related cortical areas. This interpretation is difficult to sustain in view of JG s normal performance on neu- ropsychological measures sensitive to frontal and tem- poral lobe dysfunction. A few previous patients have been reported with an extensive and persistent inability to access remote mem- ories (along with anterograde amnesia) following bilat- eral thalamic infarction [42, 71, 90, 97]. In addition, a patient described by Peru and Fabbro [77] initially showed both a retrograde and anterograde memory impairment after bilateral, anteromedial, thalamic venous infarction. Interestingly, their patient s retro- grade memory impairment resolved in conjunction with shrinkage of the right-sided ischaemic region. Consider- ing the overlap in site of lesion in these cases and in JG, we conclude that the thalamic regions most likely to be important to retrograde memory include the right mediodorsal nucleus, right mammillothalamic tract, postero-medial region of the left mediodorsal nucleus and internal medullary laminae bilaterally. The lesion locus in JG differs from that of patients with isolated anterograde amnesia following thalamic damage [50, 60, 65, 75, 84, 97]. In the latter cases, the com- mon area of lesion involves the left mammillothalamic tract and, in all but one [60], the left mediodorsal nucleus. The importance of the mammillo-thalamic tract in anterograde memory was emphasised in a re- cent review of neuropsychological deficits caused by thalamic infarction [95]. JG has no anterograde mem- ory deficit and, in his case, there is relative sparing of the left mediodorsal nucleus and complete sparing of the left mammillothalamic tract. JG was able to remember some details about the last few years of his life. In contrast, his more remote memories were completely lost to him. It has been postulated that transition from a predominantly hippocampus-dependent to a _neocortex-dependent mnemonic representation takes years [79, 86]. JG s pat- Thus, his case provides support both for the view that the thalamus plays a key role in providing access to neocor- tically stored memories [9, 39, 61] and, indirectly, for a time-limited contribution of the hippocampus to mem- ory consolidation (cf. [68, 86]) . The pattern of spared versus inaccessible memory in JG adds to the growing body of evidence that the division of declarative memory into just two categories- episodic and semantic [13, 87, 93] is inadequate. Dissociation s in the ability to recall different types of world knowledge has been noted previously [26, 28, 34, 37, 40, 42, 51]. Findings from these cases, and now also from JG, indicate that knowledge such as words and meanings, The nature of this difference has not been much explored graphical events or to particular points in time [10. 52]. Furthermore, We are currently exporing these issues. The lack of concern demonstrated by JG over his loss of past memories has been noted in other patients with retrograde amnesia caused by thalamic infarction [15, 80, 92]. If this attitude is prevalent in patients with isolated retrograde amnesia, it may help to explain why 1044 L. A. Miller et al. / Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1037-1046 the diagnosis is so rare. In JG s case, the initial CT scan was reported as normal and within a few weeks of his hospitalization, he had returned to work and to some of his previous sporting interests. His wife said he had no significant problems in carrying out his activities o: daily living. Had he had not complained of loss o: memory for his past life and had MR scanning no been conducted, the remarkable features of his case could easily have been missed. It may also be importan that much of his past life had occurred in a differen physical context involving different people than those with whom he was presently familiar. Because of the relative preservation of JG s recent memory and his ability to recognise those with whom he had had recen contact, this pattern of retrograde amnesia might have been less apparent in someone who had remained in the same place all his life. Overall, the findings from JG provide unique evi- dence that the right mesiodorsal region of the thalamus plays a crucial role in the ability to access remote memories, including those pertaining to autobiographi- some aspects of world knowledge. These findings are consistent with the proposals put forward by Markow- itsch and colleagues [29, 61] that the right hemisphere has a special role in autobiographical memory. We hypothesize that the right mediodorsal nucleus, right mammillothalamic tract and right internal medullary lamina (and possibly parts of the left mediodorsal nucleus and left internal medullary lamina) comprise the central processing mechanism referred to by Mc- Clelland [63] and Markowitsch [61] as responsible for inducing and coordinating the recall of cortically stored memory engrams.

COLLINSON , AMUTHA MEYYAPPAN|, & JEFFREY V. ROSENFELD? 1Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, ?National University Hospital, Singapore, and * Departments of Surgery and Neurosurgery, Monash University and Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (Received 9 Fuly 2008; revised 24 November 2008; accepted 26 November 2008) Abstract Primary objective: To illustrate the clinical course of a patient with a marked amnestic syndrome resulting from a closed head injury that had significant effects on frontal and thalamic memory structures. Methods and procedures: The patient underwent a series of brain imaging investigations (CT and MRI) and neuropsychological investigations to determine the severity and course of behavioural and cognitive impairments. Results: Three months post-injury, the patient demonstrated dense retrograde and anterograde amnesia for auditory-verbal and visuo-spatial information, disorientation and confabulation. In contrast, memory for faces appeared unimpaired. One month later the patient s behaviour, orientation and spatial memory had improved with no concomitant improvement in auditory-verbal memory. Conclusions: The findings indicate that injury to the diencephalon manifests in a verbal amnesic syndrome that is anterograde in nature if localized in the region of the anterior left thalamus, but leaves a relatively intact visual memory. Furthermore, injuries to the frontal and temporal lobes and their projections to the diencephalon may be more important in the emergence and resolution of retrograde amnesia and disturbances in autobiographical recall than previously appreciated. Keywords: Amnesia, traumatic injury, diffuse axonal injury Introduction cortico subcortical connections. The rarity of dis- crete injuries to the thalamus has prevented a comprehensive and complete clinical profile of the thalamus and its cortical connection in the emergence and resolution of amnesia [6, 7]. This study reports the course and outcome of an unusual case of closed head injury that resulted in a deep thalamic haemor- rhage and marked amnestic syndrome. Amnesia is a recognized consequence of injury to the major structures of the diencephalon. Squire and Moore [1] vividly described N. A. , a patient with a marked amnesia resulting from a fencing foil that entered the right nostril and went across the mid-line towards the left thalamus. Several other cases of penetrating thalamic injuries have since followed [2]. These and other cases have shown that thalamic injuries can result in a clinical syndrome comprising : Case report dense retrograde and anterograde amnesia, confabu- P lation and severe personality changes.

As he was found near his cycle with a protective helmet on, it was presumed that he was a victim of a hit-and-run collision. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at the scene of the accident was 3, rising to 7 on admission. Upon arrival at the hospital preliminary investigations showed lacera- tions and bruises to the right shoulder and face with blood in the right ear. A Computer Tomography (CT) brain scan showed multiple petechial haemor- rhages, haemorrhage in the corpus callosum and bifrontal heamorrhages. Figures 1 and 2 show CT images taken 24 hours after the accident and show evidence of a deep heamorrhage of the right frontal lobe and a small haemorrhage in the postero-lateral left thalamus, respectively. He was sedated, intu- bated and an external ventricular drain (EVD) was inserted. The EVD was removed 6 days later and he was reported to be responding well and obeying commands, but with some left-sided weakness. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 2 weeks following injury and underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. A 1 cm haematoma was found adjacent to the corpus callosum in the region of the velum interpositum. A series of small 5mm haemorrhages were seen in the right frontal white matter and a small haemorrhage in the postero-lateral left thalamus. Cortical contusion of the left temporal pole was also reported. No mass effect was seen. Multiple foci of Figure 1. Computed Tomography (CT) axial scan without contrast performed on the 24 hours following injury showing a small haemorrhage in the right basal ganglia. blooming were seen on gradient echo images at grey/ white matter interfaces in keeping with diffuse axonal injury. Bilateral subdural collections were seen to overlie the frontal and temporal convexities, measuring 8mm on the right and 7mm on the left. There was no evidence of blooming on the gradient echo, suggesting traumatic subdural hygromas rather than subdural haematoma. On admission to rehabilitation he was disoriented to person, place and time. His information proces- sing was slow and he was repetitive in conversation. Formal assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) commenced 5 days after admission. In the following 30 days, DD maintained fluctuating scores of 6-7 out of 12 on the Westmead PTA Scale and remained at 7/12 on discontinuation. Subsequently, his sleep wake cycle settled and his attention was more stable. Based on this, his estimated length of PTA was 49 days, although it is noted that this figure was some- what arbitrary in the presence of ongoing memory disturbance. A follow-up CT scan 2 months after injury showed significant decrease in the size of subdural collections measuring ~3 mm in depth on the right side and almost complete resolution on the left side. Intraparenchymal abnormalities shown on MRI could not be visualized on the CT. He was seen for neuropsychological assessment ~3 months fol- lowing the initial injury. Figure 2.

Injury and recovery: Severe amnestic syndrome following TBI 73 Neuropsychological assessment During the neuropsychological assessment DD s speech was highly repetitive and grossly confabula- tory. In one 2-hour session, he repeated the same joke more than 10 times, identically and with variations. DD showed no real orientation to time and exhibited a marked retrograde amnesia. His orientation to place was similarly impaired and fluctuated between the belief that he was on a school camp (although he was 26 years of age at the time) or being at University. He had no recollection of being in hospital or having been told he had been in an accident. He was unaware of any problems with his cognition or memory. On formal review, DD demonstrated evidence of at least average range pre-morbid IQ (Table 1) . More routine information processing and routine mental operations, such as counting upwards, remembering the days of the week or months of the year was intact. Speed of information processing was relatively slow, but not abnormal. There was no indication of visual agnosia, visuo- perceptual or visuo-constructional impairments. His auditory working and spatial memory was within normal limits. Table I. Neuropsychological test scores expressed as raw, 2-scores and estimated percentiles.

L. Collinson et al. DD demonstrated a gross amnesia for auditory verbal information. Gross impairments were observed in learning the items of a 12-item word list (<10%) . After a short delay he was unable to recall or recognize any of the words from the list. Similarly, he was unable to recall any items of two prose passages after a 30-minute delay. Visuo-spatial recall was also impaired, although he was able to remember elements of a complex figure after a delay. Higher order functions showed no abnormality in visual or verbal abstract reasoning. His ability to inhibit over-learned responses was significantly impaired and he had difficulty initiating new response sets on a verbal fluency task, which was also hampered by marked perseveration. Similarly, he was inflexible in shifting between competing response sets in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) . Follow-up Immediately following the preliminary neuropsycho- logical assessment a rehabilitation strategy was started that attempted to capitalize on DD s better visuo-spatial memory in order to aid his orientation. He was required to choose a photograph from the newspaper each day and attempt to recall three facts associated with the picture. Other visual strategies were employed such as the use of visual associates to aid his recall of various therapists names. After ~1 week, therapists noted improvements in orientation and understanding of environment. The severity of his retrograde amnesia was quantified by the disparity in his view of his current situation (back at a school camp or university) and the actual date. He was highly repetitive and from close monitoring it was possible to discern the approximate time at which his retrograde amnesia resolved. He was able to recall that he was in hospital and the reasons for his admission. Correspondingly there was an increase in insight, which was accompanied by a marked reduction in mood. At 4 months post-injury a further assessment was conducted to determine his insight and orientation. He was able to correctly recall the year and was close to recalling the day and date correctly. He was able to recall the names of recent political figures and an account of the previous 4 years of employment since leaving university. He was no longer confabulating, less preservative and less prone to tangents in conversation. He could recall details he had been told about the accident, including the date. Despite these improvements, he remained highly repetitive in conversation. On testing of visuo-spatial memory, he showed marked improvements in both new learning and recognition memory, but there was no comparable change in auditory verbal learning or memory and he was unable to recall or recognize any previously presented auditory verbal material. Discussion Traumatic injury to the thalamus is known to result in marked neurocognitive, behaviour and personality change. In particular, memory disorders including retrograde and anterograde amnesia are commonly reported [6, 8-11], as well as aphasia [12, 13], frontal disinhibition [14], motor problems [15], severe personality changes [16, 17] and hypersexu- ality [18]. Despite the apparent lifting of post-traumatic amnesia at 2 months post-injury, as evidenced by a return to normal sleep-wake cycle and intact attention, the patient remained disoriented and grossly confabulatory at 3 months post-injury with spatial information. By 4 months, the rehabilitation team recorded significant improvements in DD s mental state although not formally measured, his and he was oriented. With this improvement there was an accompanying resolution of the amnesia for visuo- spatial material but DD remained densely amnesic DD demonstrates the unpredictable nature and time course of recovery following thalamic injury. tion and retrograde amnesia, the injury to the left or, anecdotally, in the 3 years since his injury. In a previous case study, Parkin et al. [8] described a similar patient following a left thalamic infarction who developed a severe episodic amnesia with a profound deficit in verbal memory in the context of normal intelligence. Such severe impair- ment was considered possible only if the lesion, Other studies have implicated only the left mammil- verbal episodic amnesias [9, 10, 14]. It is therefore apparent that in DD s case the large haemorrhage of the left thalamus resulted in the dense auditory verbal amnesia, yet left visuo-spatial memory Injury and recovery: Severe amnestic syndrome following TBI 75 unaffected. In a similar case, Schott et al. [19] described a man who was recruited as a control subject for a longitudinal MRI study and later sustained a left thalamic infarct during the course of the study. Information was available on his pre- morbid cognitive status and a brain scan had been conducted which was normal at the point of recruitment. Like DD, this patient experienced memory. Both cases provide clear evidence of lateralization of memory processing at the subcor- tical level of the thalamus. This case highlights the potential role of cortico- thalamic structures in the emergence and resolution of some of the key symptoms that follow severe head injury including disorientation, Although these features are sometimes also found in delirium states with or without concomitant brain injury, they are also common in a range of disorders that primarily affect fronto-cortical and diencephalic atrophy. For instance, confabulation, the generation of false memories in the context of amnesia, occurs in many disorders that involve compromise of memory control functions particularly where the orbitofrontal and ventromedial cortex is damaged (20, 21], and several studies have shown the resolution of confabulation with the return of normal perfusion to the frontal cortex and improve- ment in frontal/executive function [22, 23]. In line with this DD s confabulation resolved with signs of improvement in frontal/executive function, including increased insight, reduced perseveration and tangentiality. The memory components of past recall also rely on the intact functioning of cortico-thalamic e anteromesial thalamus, including the mammillo-thalamic tract and dorsomedial nucleus, have rich projections to frontal and tem- poral regions of the brain, which play a crucial role in memory formation and retrieval of past memory [9, 14, 24, 25]. In particular, the is believed to play a specific role in accessing autobiographical and semantic details, autobiographical incidents and some aspects of world knowledge [9, 24]. Several recent studies. [9, 10, 14, 26, 27]. In DD s case, however, there was no discernable injury to the right thalamus and correspondingly he could access considerable autobiographical detail from his life prior to the 4 years he had lost to retrograde amnesia. The notion that cortical insult of an interaction is not unprecedented. Kopelman. contract, patents with froma lobe lesions were more whilst those with temporal lobe lesions demonstrated a similar impairment, albeit with a flat ? temporal gradient. In DD s case, the resolution of and, given that his right thala- mus was intact, suggests that cortical insult plays a (GERERGHGSERRERID than may have been previously appreciated. In conclusion, while the present case study offers further evidence of the specific anatomical correlates of functional pathologies in memory, it also high- lights the fact that memory relies upon a complex network of cortical and subcortical structures. While irreversible damage to these structures may lead to debilitating memory deficits, the distributed nature of the network may also permit intact structures to be tapped in order to help patients cope with their disabilities. In DD s case, his intact visual memory served as an anchor point for a rehabilitation programme that has been used to assist his re- integration. Although he still faces intractable problems with auditory verbal learning and recogni- tion, his day-to-day functioning has improved through the use of external visual aids in the form of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) , notes and alarms. He has now resumed employment on a part- time basis in a hospital department of records. Declaration of interest: The authors report no conflicts of interest.

Carlesimo!, Maurizio Sabbadini!, Antonella Loasses! and Carlo Caltagirone!* ('LR. C. C. S. S. Lucia, Roma, Italy; ?Clinica Neurologica, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata , Italy) ABSTRACT This study aimed to characterize the qualitative pattern of focal retrograde memory impairment shown by a post-encephalitic patient (AV) . AV s memory deficit encompassed autobiographical data, public events and famous people. In a public events questionnaire, she demonstraed a smooth negative temporal gradient with good recollection of events that occurred about 15 years before the disease but poor memory of more recent events. Her visual input lexicon was unimpaired, as demonstrated by normal lexicality judgment for words and normal familiarity judgment for proper names, but she was poor in familiarity judgment for famous faces (prosopagnosia) and in accessing the meaning of words or specific information about people. The cerebral MRI demonstrated widespread abnormal intensity areas encroaching upon the white matter of temporal, parietal and occipital lobes but sparing temporal poles and orbito-frontal cortex. Key words: memory disorders, retrograde amnesia, Herpes virus encephalitis. INTRODUCTION Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, along with severe head trauma, is the most frequent cause of memory impairment in young individuals. Most of the times, post- encephalitic patients suffer from a difficulty in storing new memories (anterograde amnesia) and an impairment in recalling events experienced before the onset of encephalitis (retrograde amnesia) (e. g. , Damasio, Eslinger, Damasio et al. , 1985; Warrington and McCarthy, 1988) . In a low number of cases, the anterograde memory impairment resolves, leaving the patient affected only by an isolated deficit of retrograde memory (O Comnor, Butters, Miliotis et al. , 1992; Yoneda, Yamadori, Mori et al. , 1992; for a review, see Kapur, 1993) . The retrograde memory impairment in post-encephalitic patients generally encompasses both autobiographical and public events information (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Damasio et al. , 1985) and its temporal extension varies among patients. Sometimes it homogeneously covers the entire lifetime period (Damasio et al. , 1985) , in other cases it presents with a smooth temporal gradient in which more remote memories are better preserved than more recent ones (Cermak and O Connor, 1983) and in still others, it limits itself to the period immediately preceding the onset of encephalitis (Yoneda et al. , 1992) . In these patients, the retrograde memory impairment frequently involves basic semantic knowledge, occasionally producing characteristic patterns of dissociations between knowledge of different classes of objects, such as living as opposed to nonliving things (e. g. , Barbarotto, Capitani and Laiacona, 1996; Pietrini, Nertempi, Vaglia et al. , 1988) or Cortex, (1998) 34, 449-460 450 Giovanni A. Carlesimo and Others individual identity as opposed to events happening to the same individual (McCarthy and Warrington, 1992) . In this study, we report the case of a patient who, following the acute phase of a Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, displayed a severe impairment of both autobiographical and semantic components of retrograde memory, with substantial preservation of the ability to learn new information. In particular, we investigated: (a) whether the memory deficit was homogeneous across different lifetime periods or it varied according to some kind of temporal gradient; (b) the level of information processing at which the retrograde memory impairment occurred. In particular, whether it involved visuo-perceptual or lexical representations of knowledge, or whether it involved more central semantic representations. Case REPORT AV, a 29-year-old, right-handed woman with a university degree in law was admitted to the Neurological Clinic on April, 1994, with a two-week complaint of behavioral and emotional alterations (depressed mood, social isolation) that had progressively evolved to a confusional state (characterized by temporo-spatial disorientation, misidentification of people, agitation alternating with lethargy) and left hemiparesis. A few days after admission, AV developed a comatose state that lasted 15 days. A cerebral MRI performed during this eriod showed widespread abnormal intensity areas diffused to the white matter of Remarkably, the temporal poles and hippocampal regions of both hemispheres appeared to be substantially spared by the abnormal intensity areas (Figure 1) . Even though a CSF examination failed to demonstrate significant elevation of anti-herpes virus antibodies concentration, a diagnosis of herpes encephalitis was tentatively made. Following the acyclovir treatment, she recovered vigilance and gradually became more active and alert. She continued to improve gradually and in January, 1995 she was admitted to the I. R. C. C. S. S. Lucia Hospital in Rome for rehabilitation. At that time, a general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination was negative for motor or somatosensory deficits. The patient complained of blurry vision and formal testing documented visual acuity loss with residual vision of 5/10 in the right eye and 1/10 in the left eye. Clinical and formal visual field testing documented bilateral central scotoma. Although AV reported difficulty only in remembering episodes occurring in the last few months immediately preceding the onset of encephalitis, her parents reported widespread loss of both personal memories and academic knowledge. The ability to acquire new information appeared far less impaired. Clinical observation suggested that the patient had a deficit in recognizing people by their faces (prosopagnosia) . The neuropsychological investigation described below was carried out from January to June, 1995. During this period, AV received daily sessions of neuropsychological rehabilitation. General Neuropsychological Examination Language AV s spontaneous speech was fluent and grammatically correct with normal articulation and prosody. Her writing and reading appeared substantially normal. She scored 35/36 on the Token test (De Renzi and Faglioni, 1978) but only 34/60 on the Boston Naming test (Kaplan, Goodglass and Weintraub, 1983) . Most of her errors on this test were omissions ( I don t remember the name ) , but some name substitutions with a semantically related name was also noted (e. g. , lobster for seahorse or die for domino) . General Intelligence On the WAIS (Wechsler, 1955) , AV obtained a Verbal IQ of 87 and a Performance IQ of 90. The Full Scale 1Q of 88, although very close to the normal range, was clearly below Focal retrograde amnesia 451 706d HIE OS aet Fig. 1 MRI slides performed during the acute phase of the disease. 452 Giovanni A.

However, on the Coloured Progressive Matrices 47 (Raven, 1949) , she obtained a high score of 35/36. Anterograde Memory Short- and long-term memory for visual and verbal material was tested twice. As shown in Table I, in the first evaluation (February) , AV obtained scores at the lower limit or below the normal controls range on most tests. However, in the second evaluation (May) , her performance scores were globally improved and she remained pathological only in the learning of a supraspan spatial sequence. Moreover, on the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1945) , administered in May, she obtained an MQ of 89, almost perfectly overlapping the Full Scale IQ. Visuo-perceptual Skills On a task of copying linear drawings (Gainotti, Miceli and Caltagirone, 1977) , AV scored in the range of normal subjects. In view of the clinical evidence of prosopagnosia, AV was tested with a matching task of unfamiliar faces photographed either from the same point of view or from different points of view and under reduced lighting conditions (Carlesimo and Caltagirone, 1995) . On this task, AV scored 28/41, within the normal range (performance score of 50 normal subjects ranges from 24 to 41) , thus suggesting that apperceptive difficulties did not play a crucial role in recognizing faces. In sum, AV demonstrated a moderate deterioration of her pre-encephalitic general Focal retrograde amnesia 453 intelligence. The only language impairment she displayed was a visual naming deficit. A mild anterograde memory impairment, documented at the first neuropsychological evaluation, had almost completely resolved at the second testing session, three months later. Finally, despite a severe loss of visual acuity, AV maintained residual vision sufficient to perform complex visual discrimination tasks. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION Temporal Gradient of the Retrograde Memory Deficit AV s temporal distribution of retrograde memory impairment was evaluated by means of two autobiographical memory tests covering her lifetime starting from 5 years of age and a test of recognition of public events that had occurred in the period ranging from adolescence to the onset of encephalitis. Experiment 1: Autobiographical Memory With the help of AV s mother, we sampled 33 main episodes of the patient s life prior to onset of the disease. There were 5 to 7 episodes for each of four 5-year periods starting from the age of 5 to 25 and 9 episodes for the last three years prior to encenhalitis. For each episode, AV was probed by the examiner with a few words summarizing the event (e. g. , the marriage of aunt Angioletta ) and was required to provide a detailed account of the event, when and where it occurred and the persons she remembered as being present. AV s responses were recorded on a magnetic tape and her performance was subsequently scored on a 0-3 point scale according to the following criteria: On the second test of autobiographical memory, visual rather than verbal probes were utilized. From a large sample of photos provided by her mother, 30 photos representing relevant episodes and persons of AV s life were selected. There were 3 to 7 photos for each of four 5-year periods starting from the age of 5 to 25 and 5 photos for the last three years prior to encephalitis. Also in this case, a magnetic recording of AV s responses was made and performance level was subsequently scored on a 0-3 point scale, following the same criteria used in the verbal test. AV clearly had problems in recalling autobiographical events. Following verbal probes he generally claimed to remember the event but her narration was usually generic, lacking Ss (@Eio Ls SS LE GRE ERANOMUNAREPINGSMERISNIEGS events not occurred in the last three years prior to encephalitis, AV frequently admitted having no clear recollection. The he rit seo failed to evoke a ue of saF tee oe and also in this soul AV s performance scores on the two autobiographical memory tests are reported in Figure 2. While the overall performance level was defective on both tasks, that on the visual task was poorer than that on the verbal task (38% and 52% of accuracy, respectively) . Moreover, the temporal gradient of the memory impairment was different. On the verbal test, recall of personal data was deficient across all lifetime periods, with a particularly pronounced deficit peak in the three years before the encephalitis. On the visual test, instead, memories evoked by photos of infancy (5-10 years of age) were fairly well evoked, at variance with a severe and homogeneous memory deficit for episodes from all subsequent lifetime periods. Experiment 2: Famous Event Questionnaire The Famous Events Recognition test was a modified version of the test devised by Costa, De Renzi and Faglioni (1989) .

For each test item, AV was questioned about a detail concerning a single event (e. g. , February 11, 1992, a famous boxer was condemned in the U. S. A. for rape. What was his name? ) and requested to indicate the correct response on a 4-choice array of alternatives (e. g. , Cassius Clay, Nino Benvenuti, Patrizio Oliva, Mike Tyson) . The questions were presented in chronological order. As shown in Figure 3, AV displayed a typical temporal gradient on this task, scoring in the range of normal controls for 1980-81 and progressively worse in the following years. In contrast, normals performance showed a trend to improvement for most recent years. Comment AV had a retrograde memory impairment that encompassed both autobiographical and public events. However, the three tests evoked different-shaped temporal gradients of memory impairment. On the test of Autobiographical memory probed by verbal cues, AV displayed a very irregular temporal profile of memory impairment with worst scores regarding events occurred in the last few years before the onset of encephalitis. On the Famous Events test, instead, recognition of famous events that occurred when AV was still an adolescent appeared to be preserved while memories from the subsequent periods were progressively more impaired the closer they were to the onset of encephalitis. Finally, in the Autobiographical memory test probed by photographic material, recall of memories from the entire lifetime, with the exception of the infancy period, was homogeneously impaired. Several factors may have contributed to producing discrepant temporal gradients of retrograde memory impairment in different tasks. In particular, the subjective salience of personal events sampled in the autobiographical tests can only be deduced from AV s mother s report, but no objective way of controlling for difficulty of questions pertaining to Focal retrograde amnesia 455 2 = 1 1 a 80-81 82-83 84-85 86-87 88-89 90-91 92-93 Years - Controls --. AV Fig. 3 AV and controls performance on the Public Events test as a function of the period in which the event occurred. different lifetime periods is actually available. As a consequence, we are inclined to give credit to the temporal gradient disclosed by the Famous Events test as the most reliable estimate in AV of the relationship between accuracy of event recollection and time elapsed from the occurrence of that event. Level of Information Processing at Which the Retrograde Deficit Occurs A problem frequently discussed 456 Giovanni A. Carlesimo and Others meaning) . To discriminate between these two types of deficit, we contrasted the patient s performance on tests requiring sense of familiarity with those requiring semantic knowledge. Experiment 3: Lexical and Semantic Decision Tasks The first test contrasted lexical decision for written words and non-words [involving the operations of a visuo-verbal representation system: the visual input lexicon (Ellis and Young, 1988) ] with semantic decision for the attribution of correct and incorrect meanings to the same words (depending on the operations of the semantic memory system) . Fifty, low-frequency (< 10 per million, according to Bortolini, Tagliavini and Zampulli, 1971) , five- to fourteen-letter words were selected for this test. By substituting or transposing one to three letters in these 50 words, 100 legal non-words were obtained (e. g. , catostrafe from catastrofe) . On the lexical decision task, one word and two non-words were visually presented in a vertical array and the subject was requested to point to the real word. On the semantic decision task, the subject had to identify the correct definition (e. g. , temple) of the target word (e. g. , synagogue) , which was presented with two incorrect definitions (e. g. , meditation technique, mathematical equation) at the top of the page. Five normal age- matched subjects scored 50/50 on both tasks. AV scored 50/50 on the lexical decision task and 40/50 on the semantic decision task (chi-square = 11. 1; p < . 001) , thus demonstrating normal functioning of the visual lexicon but a defective access to meaning in the semantic system. Experiment 4: Famous Face and Famous Name Tests Famous people are widely used for testing retrograde memory. Although photographs of faces have been the preferred testing material in most studies (e. g. , Carlesimo and Caltagirone, 1995; Warrington and James, 1967) , proper names have been used as well (de Haan, Young and Newcombe, 1991; Ellis, Young and Critchley, 1989; McCarthy and Warrington, 1992) . In this test, we contrasted sense of familiarity and access to general information about famous people evoked by faces and proper names. In each of the 20 items of the Famous Face task, four black and white 9 cm x 6. 5 cm photographs of faces were presented in a vertical array. Faces were front-view or slightly rotated, frequently smiling, and in full lighting conditions. One face was that of a celebrity and the other three of nonfamous persons. Subjects were requested to give three types of responses: (a) familiarity judgment (pointing to the face of the famous person) , (b) category (occupation of the famous individual: politics, movies, music, TV) , and (c) proper name. In each of the 20 items of the Famous Name task, four names were visually presented in a vertical array. One corresponded to the name of a famous person shown in the face task and three to non famous persons. AV was requested (a) to point to the name that looked familiar, (b) to recall the occupational category of the corresponding person and (c) to give some details of its biography. As shown in Table II, AV s accuracy of familiarity judgment differed strikingly as a function of the visuo-perceptual or lexical modality of input. She was 100% correct for proper names, but was defective (45% correct) for faces (the familiarity judgement for the same 20 faces in a group of 50 normal controls ranged from 85% to 100%) . On the facial test, less than half of the faces identified as familiar evoked the correct occupational category, but none the proper name. On the verbal test, instead, recall of occupation was TABLE II AV s Performance Scores on Famous Face and Famous Name Tests (Experiment 4) Type of input Proper name Face Familiarity judgement 20/20 Familiarity judgement 9/20 Occupation 18/20 Occupation 4/20 Specific information 4/20 Proper name 0/20 Focal retrograde amnesia 457 generally correct (90%) , though a more detailed investigation of semantic knowledge demonstrated very limited access to specific information about the famous personalities. Comment On a multiple-choice test contrasting lexical and semantic decision for low-frequency words, AV demonstrated a dissociation between preserved lexical knowledge and deficient access to the meaning of words. The familiarity judgment was normal for proper names but deficient for faces. Yet, both names and faces that were correctly recognized failed to gain access to detailed knowledge in the semantic system. DISCUSSION Kapur (1993) recently reviewed the literature in search of cases presenting with a focal form of retrograde amnesia (FRA) , defined by the author as marked retrograde amnesia with minimal anterograde amnesia (p. 217) . In his survey, Kapur (1993) identified 8 cases fitting the FRA criteria, 2 of which were post-encephalitic patients (Stuss and Guzman, 1988; O Connor et al. , 1992) . Another case of postencephalitic FRA has been reported by De Renzi and Lucchelli (1993) . The present patient meets the requirements for this classification. Her mild anterograde memory impairment, revealed during the first neuropsychological evaluation, almost completely resolved at the time of the second testing session, three months later. In contrast, her retrograde memory deficit, encompassing autobiographical data, public events, famous people and basic semantic knowledge, was stable across the six months of our observation. AV s performance on retrograde memory tests yielded different temporal profiles. Though a comparison between her performance and a normal temporal gradient was unfeasible for the autobiographical tests, which were ad hoc constructed for AV, the sparing of the earliest memories on the Famous Events questionnaire is worth stressing. AV s retrograde forgetting curve strikingly diverged from that disclosed by a group of age- matched controls. While normal controls remembered the events progressively better the more recent they were, AV s memory was preserved for events that occurred 15 years before the disease but deteriorated for events that look place in the subsequent periods. A similar temporal gradient of retrograde memory impairment, i. e. , normal recollection of most remote memories and deficient memory of more recent events with a smooth negative temporal gradient, has been previously described in both single case and group studies. For example, it has been a relatively frequent report in studies investigating retrograde memory of amnesic post-alcoholic Korsakoff patients (e. g. , Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975; Seltzer and Benson, 1974; Squire, Haist and Shimamura, 1989) . Moreover, Salmon, Lasker, Butters et al. (1988) reported the case of a patient with normal memory for public events that occurred in the 40s and 50s but progressively worse memory for events that took place in the following decades. The negative temporal gradient has been generally interpreted as due to the strengthening of memory traces (and their resistance to cerebral damage) caused by their repeated retrieval. This, in turn, is positively related to the time elapsed since the event. It is worth noting, however, that in the so far published cases, the average age of amnesic subjects was around 60 and in extreme cases the temporal gradient demonstrated by the experimental tasks extended over half a century (e. g. , Seltzer and Benson, 1974) . Based on this kind of evidence, it has been suggested (Kapur, 1993) that retrieval processes are only effective in modulating the strength of memory traces when they are carried out over very long periods of time. Thus, the appearance of a negative temporal gradient of retrograde memory impairment would be unlikely in young subjects. The present case disconfirms this hypothesis and shows that retrieval processes operating over periods of time of about one decade are sufficient to demonstrate a temporal gradient of memory decay also in young subjects. The distinction between structural description and semantic level of information processing has not always been taken into account in the experimental investigation of 458 Giovanni A. Carlesimo and Others retrograde memory. For example, in studies investigating the recognition of famous people, a familiarity judgement for faces or proper names has been very infrequently requested (e. g. , Sanders and Warrington, 1971; Markowitsch, Calabrese, Liess et al. , 1993) , thus making it impossible to determine the extent to which the identification failure was contingent upon a deficient semantic system or the impairment of perceptual memory for faces or lexical memory for proper names. When such a distinction was made (e. g. , Warrington and McCarthy, 1988; de Haan, Young and Newcombe, 1991; Hodges and McCarthy, 1993) , most of time amnesics demonstrated a dissociation between the normal processing of the stimulus at the perceptual or lexical level and the deficient access or recollection of data from the semantic system. In sporadic cases, however, both familiarity judgment for faces or names and recollection of general information about famous people were impaired (De Renzi, Liotti and Nichelli, 1987; Ellis, Young and Critchley, 1989; Hodges et al. , 1992) , thus suggesting a contribution of deficient visuo-verbal and visuo- perceptual description systems to the faulty recognition of famous people. The analysis of AV s memory performances enabled us to detect a few dissociations across different presemantic structural description systems and between the visuo-verbal description system (i. e. , the visual input lexicon) and the semantic system. In fact, AV ha perfect lexicality judgment for low-frequency words and perfect familiarity judgement for the proper names of famous people, thus demonstrating a normally functioning visual input lexicon. On the contrary, her familiarity judgment for faces of famous and nonfamous people was faulty, demonstrating an impairment of the visuo-perceptual description system storing memory representations of previously experienced faces. Moreover, AV hai difficulty both in providing the exact meaning of words she had accurately discriminated from nonwords and in identifying famous people whose names she had correctly recognize as familiar. These last data strongly suggest reduced effectiveness of the normally represented units in the visual lexicon in activating the corresponding nodes in the semantic system in order to access relevant information about people. The anatomical substrate of retrograde amnesia is uncertain. Based on a review of the available literature and of MRI findings from two their own cases, Kroll, Markowitsch, Knight et al. (1997) recently emphasized the role of lesions encroaching upon the temporal poles (Broadman area 38 and adjacent areas) and inferolateral prefrontal cortex (portions 0: Broadman areas 10, 12 and 47) in producing a focal disorder of retrograde memory. The lesional pattern disclosed by AV is at variance with cases reported by Kroll et al. (1997) . In AV, in fact, the cerebral damage substantially spared the temporal poles, the hippocampi (thus accounting for preserved anterograde memory) and the orbito-frontal cortex. In contrast, the white matter of the posterior half of temporal lobes and of parietal and occipital lobes was largely involved. It worths noting that other FRA cases with cerebral damage substantially sparing temporal poles and/or fronto-orbital cortex but affecting posterior temporal and parietal cortical and subcortical areas have been reported (O Connor et al. , 1992; Goldberg et al. , 1981) . In conclusion, it seems that an isolated and pervasive retrograde memory deficit can occur as a consequence of at least two different cerebral lesional patterns, one characterized by focal lesions encroaching upon the temporo-polar and orbito-frontal cortical areas, the other involving a diffuse damage of associative areas of posterior-temporal and parietal lobes.

        "other": "in the neuropsychological literature on retrograde memory deficits is the level of information processing at which the memory impairment originates. Current theories distinguish a number of independent, pre-semantic, perceptual and lexical representation systems, each processing the perceptual or verbal information in a given modality (e. g. , visuo-perceptual, auditory-verbal, visuo-verbal, etc. ) , and all converging in a free-modality semantic memory system (Riddoch, Humphreys, Coltheart et al. , 1988; Ellis and Young, 1988) . Accordingly, two main kinds of retrograde memory impairment are predicted. A lesion affecting one (or more) of the pre-semantic representation systems will impair the access of relevant information to the semantic system via that (or those) specific perceptual channel (s) . The behavioral expression of this impairment will be a pure agnosic (e. g. , visual agnosia) or verbal comprehension (e. g. , dyslexia) deficit characterized by (a) recognition deficit in the perceptual or lexical modality involved (e. g. , visual) and (b) normal recognition when alternative modalities (e. g. , auditory) are used. Alternatively, the lesions can directly disrupt the semantic system and produce a deficit of semantic knowledge that is independent of the perceptual or verbal modality used in the test. According to Ellis and Young (1988) , when a perceptual or lexical input matches its memory representation in the pre-semantic representation system, it evokes a feeling of familiarity (awareness of a previous exposure) which, in turn, provides an input to the semantic system for the activation of the corresponding semantic knowledge (access to Cognitive Neuropsychology.

Comparisons with demographically matched controls indicated that aspects of temporal thought and future-oriented decision making are preserved in indi- viduals with hippocampal amnesia despite their inability to imagine themselves in detailed future events. Thus, even extensive MTL damage and the resulting episodic amnesia do not preclude prudent decision making, including consideration of future financial outcomes and personal identification with the past and future.

Although this metaphor is This article was published Online First August 26, 2013. Donna Kwan, Department of Psychology, York University, Toronto, On- tario, Canada; Carl F.

We wish to acknowledge the patients and their families for their time travel can be further reduced to several basic and dissociable processes that have been confounded with each other in previous work, and only some of which appear to be hippocam- pally dependent. For example, impaired episodic memory and future imagining in hippocampal amnesia might reflect a deficit in the fundamental ability to retrieve and/or bind details into coherent narratives rather than an inability to travel mentally through time. Consistent with this view, individuals with episodic amnesia have difficulty constructing spatially coherent imaginings of common- place scenes even when the scene is not temporally organized (Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, & Maguire, 2007) . Furthermore, indi- viduals with episodic amnesia have difficulty constructing seman- tic narratives of fairy tales and bible stories that are impersonal and not necessarily temporally dated (Rosenbaum, Gilboa, Levine, Winocur, & Moscovitch, 2009) . These findings suggest that epi- sodic amnesia resulting from hippocampal damage is less a con- sequence of impaired future thinking per se and may be more a consequence of an inability to collect and assemble or relate disparate details into a coherent scene or narrative (Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, & Maguire, 2007; Rosenbaum et al. , 2009; Schacter & Addis, 2009) . This narrative or scene construction hypothesis is bolstered by recent findings that at least one person with episodic amnesia, K. C. , maintains the ability to make reasonable choices with respect to the future, choices that are similar to those of healthy controls. As reported in Kwan et al. (2012) , K. C. completed an economic decision making task (delay discounting) in which offers of rewards with immediate payout were continuously pitted against offers of larger rewards with delayed payout. Results showed that K. C. s preference for hypothetical larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards was comparable to that seen in healthy individuals despite his deficits in both episodic memory and future imagining. However, unlike controls, K. C. was unable to construct specific personal uses for the future rewards. Taken together, these results suggest that characterizing amnesia as a deficit in mental time travel lacks specificity because KWAN, CRAVER, GREEN, MYERSON, AND ROSENBAUM the inability to construct future scenes and scenarios does not preclude individuals with amnesia from making reasonable deci- sions about the future. That is, the temporal and constructive processes underlying episodic thought are dissociable. In the current study, we followed up on this preliminary evi- dence with a systematic investigation of different types of tempo- ral thought and decision making in K. C. and three other amnesic individuals, two with adult-onset episodic amnesia, and one with early onset amnesia who never developed normal episodic mem- ory, using tasks that do not require narrative construction. In Experiment 1, we measured the valuation of future rewards using a delay discounting task (Du, Green, & Myerson, 2002) . We also measured risk-taking behavior using a probability discounting task (Green, Myerson, & Ostaszewski, 1999) because risky behavior may reflect insensitivity to the future consequences of one s choices or an inability to anticipate regret, which they anticipate they will experience if they gamble and lose (Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001) . Numerous studies have linked risk-taking with a lack of future- oriented thinking. A range of risky behaviors including risky driving (Zimbardo, Keough, & Boyd, 1997) , sexual risk-taking (Rothspan & Read, 1996) and illicit drug use (Petry, Bickel, & Arnett, 1998) have all been attributed in part to a cognitive overemphasis on the present and a failure to adequately consider the future consequences of one s actions. According to Cottle (1977, cited in Lennings, Burns, & Cooney, 1998) , those who are cognitively biased toward the present and who do not integrate the past with the future are also more impulsive than those with a more holistic time perspective. Cottle also conceptualized such individuals experience of time as a series of discontinuous points, rather than as a unified and flowing entity, a description that would seem to fit the experience of people who are unable to mentally (re) construct their past or future experiences and who lack memory to bridge their experiences across time. Preliminary evidence from K. C. s performance on a delay discounting task indicates that the ability to value the future can be spared in the absence of the ability to construct imagined future events (Kwan et al. , 2012) : K. C. s delay discounting curves were within the range of controls curves. Nonetheless, his decision making process may have been qualitatively different from that of healthy controls. Unlike most of the controls who described a finance-based decision making strategy (e. g. , estimating inflation rates) , K. C. indicated that he relied on a gut feeling to make his choices. K. C. also reported that he could not imagine what he might do with a future reward, whereas controls readily offered such musings. The other three individuals with hippocampal damage who participated in the present study, D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. , differ from K. C. in a variety of ways, including etiology, degree of memory loss, background financial knowledge, and vocational history. D. A. has a strong educational and professional back- ground in finance, whereas H. C. has had little personal experience in dealing with personal finances and no professional experience. K. C. and D. G. likely fall somewhere in the middle of this continuum, with K. C. having had a college education in business administration and some early experience living independently, and D. G. having had a career as an engineer and experience managing personal and family finances. The present study extends our previous investigations of delay discounting from the single case of K. C. to other individuals with episodic amnesia. The present study also extends our investigation of decision making in amnesia by considering probabilistic discounting and temporal perspectives on the personal value of the past, the present, and the future. 1357 Method Participants. Amnesic cases. The amnesic individuals in our study repre- sent four unique neuropsychological cases that arose from a range of etiologies and, more importantly, differ in the severity of memory impairment (see below for detailed case descriptions) . We selected these cases to observe whether degree of memory loss would correspond with the magnitude of any observed impair- ments. The individuals demographic information, neuropsycho- logical findings, and measures of past and future episodic thought are summarized in Table 1. K. C. K. C. was 57 years old at the time of testing, is right handed, and has 16 years of formal education. His case is well documented in the literature. K. C. sustained a closed-head injury from a motorcycle accident in 1981 when he was 30 years old. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans reveal extensive volume loss in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, most notably the hippocampal formation and surrounding parahippocampal gyrus, bilaterally (see Figure 1) . Additional affected areas include the septal area, posterior thalamus, and caudate nucleus bilaterally, as well as the left amygdala, mammillary bodies, and anterior thala- mus (Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) . Despite his widespread damage, K. C. has preserved semantic memory that has remained stable since the time of his accident (Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) . When tested, he exhibits a conservative response bias with no evidence of confabulation. K. C. continues to demonstrate average IQ and relatively preserved cognitive func- tioning. One major exception to K. C. s intact functioning is his episodic memory. His head injury caused dense amnesia, both retrograde and anterograde, leaving him without episodic memory for any details of personal experiences (see Rosenbaum et al. , 2005, for detailed neuroanatomical and neuropsychological pro- files) . A recent formal test of autobiographical episodic (re) construc- tion using a modified version of the Autobiographical Interview with Galton-Crovtiz cueing confirmed what Tulving (1985) first discovered in an interview with K. C. years before: K. C. s total deficit in remembering past personal experiences also extends to imagining future personal experiences (Kwan et al. , 2012) . He is thus the first of a small set of a rare individuals who enables the investigation of spared and preserved function in other cognitive domains in the total absence of past or future episodic thought. D. A. D. A. was 59 years old at the time of testing. He is a right-handed man with 17 years of education who contracted herpes encephalitis in 1993 and has been the subject of previous studies on MTL amnesia (Rosenbaum et al. , 2008; Westmacott, Black, Freedman, & Moscovitch, 2004) . His MRI scans reveal severe damage to MTL structures, affecting the right side substan- tially more than the left (see Figure 1) . In the right hemisphere, D. A. has additional volume reductions in regions outside of the MTL, including posterior temporal, ventral frontal, occipital re- gions, anterior cingulate, and posterior thalamus. Little volume loss was reported in the right dorsal frontal, superior and inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate regions. D. A. s volume loss in the left hemisphere was relatively restricted to the MTL region. Like K. C. , D. A. s brain damage was accompanied by a pattern of preserved semantic but impaired episodic memory. He contin- ues to have average IQ and intact cognitive function outside of 1358 Table 1 KWAN, CRAVER, GREEN, MYERSON, AND ROSENBAUM Demographic and Neuropsychological Data for the Amnesic Participants Demographic/neuropsychological characteristic KG; D.

Within the episodic domain, D. A. has a mod- erate retrograde amnesia that is temporally graded (better remote than recent memory) and a significant anterograde amnesia for personal experiences (see Rosenbaum et al. , 2008, for neuroanat- omical and neuropsychological profiles) . He is able to talk about some past experiences with apparent vividness, detail, and epi- sodic richness, such as when he proposed to his wife. However, it is likely that many of these experiences have been retold over the years and are now represented in semantic memory, given that D. A. will often retell stories of personal happenings to the same person almost verbatim. In order to characterize D. A. s autobiographical episodic re- membering and future imagining, we performed a formal exami- nation with the same modified autobiographical episodic (re) con- struction test that was administered to K. C. and H. C. (see below) in previous studies (Kwan et al. , 2010, 2012) . Using modified t tests designed to compare performance of individual cases with a small control group (Crawford & Howell, 1998) , we compared D. A. s performance with that of Addis, Sacchetti, Ally, Budson, & Schacter s (2009) sample of healthy older adults (V = 16, age = 78. 75, SD = 5. 17) . The modified f test also gives estimates of effect size for the difference between single cases and controls (Crawford, Garthwaite, & Porter, 2010) . Analogous to Cohen s d, the effect size for single cases is referred to as z, . and is the difference between the patient and the mean control score, divided by the standard deviation of the control group. Supplementary Figure 1 shows that D. A. had a significantly reduced ability to recollect specific details of past experiences even when compared with much older adults ( = 2. 52 p = . 01, z, . , = 2. 59) . D. A. s impairment extends to imagining future personal expe- riences. Supplementary Figure 1 shows that compared to older adults, he was less able to imagine specific details of future experiences (t = 2. 20, p = . 03, z, , , = 2. 09) . Events that he reconstructed from memory and constructed in imagination, alike, were gist-like and lacked episodic detail, cohesion, and richness. Instead, his narratives were marked by a preponderance of external details facts, repetitions, and information that were tangential to the specific recollected or imagined experience. Moreover, several of his past recollections were stories that had been retold often by family members (see Supplementary Figure 2 for excerpts of imagined events) . DISSOCIATIONS IN FUTURE THINKING Figure 1. K. C. (A) , D. A. (B) , H. C. (C) , and a representative control participant (D) . Images are presented according to radiological convention (right hemi- sphere is presented on left side of image) . Coronal Tl MRI slices of medial temporal lobe damage in D. G. D. G. was 47 years old at the time of testing. He is a right-handed man with 16 years of education who has not yet been described in the literature. D. G. is a husband and father of two who worked as a civil engineer and was an avid hockey player and golfer until his injury. In 2010, D. G. s wife awoke in the middle of the night to what she thought was snoring and discovered that D. G. was in cardiac arrest. She initiated chest compressions until an ambulance arrived and worked for an additional 30 min during which D. G. was treated by defibrillator. He was then transferred to hospital where he received hypothermic treatment. He arrested twice more while in emergency treatment and was treated by defibrillator each time. He did not regain consciousness until approximately 48 hr after the initial incident. D. G. had an im- plantable cardioverter-defibrillator inserted following the arrest and is thus unable to undergo MRI. However, his neuropsycho- logical profile gives insight into probable areas affected by anoxia secondary to cardiac arrest. D. G. demonstrated a characteristic amnesic pattern of preserved semantic but impaired episodic memory. Upon awakening in the hospital, he estimated that he was 22 years old half of his actual age at the time. He had no memory of his children, of his home, or of several close friends. In the months following his injury, he recovered personal semantic memory (e. g. , recognition of family members and friends, his home address) , although there was evidence of along with dysarthria and some loss of fine motor control. Neuropsycholog- ical testing conducted approximately 2 1/2 years postinjury re- vealed that he continues to have average e 1Q and intact cognitive function outside of episodic memor g sia for perso periences. D. G. s wife describes his current memory function as spotty : He is able to describe some experiences in a gist-like fashion but admits that a lot of it is guesswork because [he is] not very sure. For example, he de- scribes as one of his fondest memories taking a trip with friends to attend the practice round of the Masters Tournament the year 1359 following his injury; however, he reported only having bits and pieces of the day and is uncertain about key details of the event, such as who played in the tournament. There are other significant life events that he is completely unable to recall, including his wedding day and moving into his current house. In order to characterize D. G. s autobiographical episodic re- membering and future imagining, we performed a formal exami- nation with a modified autobiographical episodic (re) construction test similar to that administered to K. C. , D. A. , and H. C. , using personally generated event cues. Using Crawford and Howell s modified t tests, we compared D. G. s performance with that of Addis et al. s (2009) sample of healthy older adults (V = 16, age = 78. 75, SD = 5. 17) . This was a conservative assessment of D. G. s memory impairment given that D. G. is 30 years younger than controls and should therefore produce more detailed narra- tives. Supplementary Figure | shows that D. G. produced significantly fewer episodic details of past experiences even when compared with much older adults (t = 2. 96 p = . 01, z, . , = 3. 05) . Dysarthria and related reduction in overall verbal fluency may have contrib- uted to D. G. s impaired episodic verbal narratives. However, he is also impaired on nonverbal memory tests, suggesting a true im- pairment across the memory domain. Moreover, like other docu- mented individuals with episodic memory impairment, D. G. s impairment extends to imagining future personal experiences. Sup- plementary Figure | shows that he produced fewer episodic details of imagined future experiences relative to older adults (t = 2. 48, p = 03, z. . , = 2. 55) . Like D. A. , both events that he reconstructed from memory and events he constructed in imagination were gist-like and featured more external, peripheral information than episodic detail (see Supplementary Figure 2 for excerpts of imag- ined events) . H. C. H. C. was 23 years old at the time of testing. She is right-handed and has 13 years of education. Her neuroanatomical and neuropsychological profiles were previously documented in the literature. H. C. was born prematurely and experienced a probable hypoxic event at the age of 1 week (Rosenbaum, Carson, et al. , 2011; Vargha-Khadem et al. , 2003) . An MRI revealed that H. C. experienced significant reduction of her hippocampus bilat- erally (Figure 1; Rabin, Carson, Gilboa, Stuss, & Rosenbaum, 2012) . According to Vargha-Khadem et al. (2003) , the remaining tissue was more than two standard deviations below the mean volume of controls. A group study of developmental amnesic cases that included H. C. reported volume reductions in the thalamus and basal ganglia bilaterally, and in retrosplenial cortex on the right; no other MTL structures reached threshold for pathology (see Vargha-Khadem et al. , 2003, patient E6, for a detailed neuroana- tomical profile) . Repeated neuropsychological testing indicated average IQ and relatively intact semantic memory. In contrast, multiple measures indicate that H. C. has not developed normal episodic memory (Kwan et al. , 2010; Rosenbaum, Carson, et al. , 2011; Vargha- Khadem et al. , 2003) . Like D. A. , H. C. s amnesia is patchy, and she can retell some memories of personal experiences with great animation and detail. However, also like D. A. , H. C. s mother confirms that some of these memories are retold frequently, often to family and friends, and they appear be recalled from semantic memory. For example, H. C. has retold the story of her 1360 own marriage proposal to some of the authors repeatedly and almost verbatim each time. Separate work shows that H. C. s episodic memory impairment extends even to memory for public events (Rosenbaum, Carson, et al. , 2011) . Along with past recollections, H. C. was less able than controls to provide richly detailed narratives of imagined future experiences using Galton-Crovitz cueing (Kwan et al. , 2010) , although the provision of more elaborate and less constrained scene cues yielded no findings of impairment when H. C. was tested again several years later (Hurley et al. , 2011) . Although methodological differences or practice effects may account for some of the discrepancies (see Rabin et al. , 2012) , H. C. s family has reported that she has difficulty considering and planning for future events. Controls. Controls for K. C and D. A. (N = 18, taken from Kwan et al. , 2012) , D. G. (N = 12) , and H. C. (N = 12) were matched on basic demographic variables including age (M = 56. 6, A. 0. 54 0. 43 0. 44 0. 51 0. 04 0. 04 Controls 0. 43 (0. 25) 0. 50 (0. 26) D.

A. reported using a strictly economic strategy, specifically estimating inflation and interest rates, but did not expand on how he made his calculations. This strategy capitalized on his premorbid professional background and did not require episodic thought. He did not spontaneously engage in episodic considerations for spending. When probed, D. A. gave vague and general examples of how he might spend the money, such as going on a vacation. D. G. simply reported wondering if [he] could wait that long when deciding be- tween immediate and delayed rewards. When pressed further, he reported that his decisions were based on a gut feeling. Likewise, K. C. (as reported in Kwan et al. , 2012) also reported relying on a gut feeling. K. C. was unable to imagine episodes or ways in which he might spend the hypothetical payout; when probed, K. C. consistently stated that he supposed he would put it in the bank. Though there was a range in decision- making strategies from episodic-like (H. C. ) to financial (D. A. ) to just gut feeling (K. C. , D. G. ) , each amnesic individual was able to take the future into systematic consideration for their economic choices. Together, the delay discounting performance and posttask inter- viewing support a dissociation between episodic future thinking and the ability to assign subjective values to future rewards. Clearly, the amnesic individuals lack of episodic future imagining did not preclude them from making future-oriented choices similar to those of nonamnesic individuals. KWAN, CRAVER, GREEN, MYERSON, AND ROSENBAUM Probability discounting. Figure 3 shows the mean subjective values for K. C. , D. A. , D. G. , H. C. , and their respective controls, as a function of the odds against receiving the reward [ (1 p) /p, where p is the probability of receiving the reward] for both the $250 (top panels) and $2000 (bottom panels) conditions. As may be seen, the amnesic individuals (like the controls) exhibited clear discounting of both the $250 and $2, 000 probabilistic rewards: In each case, the subjective value that the amnesic individuals placed on a reward decreased systematically as the odds against its receipt increased. In order to determine whether amnesic individuals discounting differed significantly from that of controls, we again calculated AuCs for each testing session for each participant. Table 3 presents the amnesic individuals and controls mean AuCs, as well as the results from modified tests. There was a marginally significant difference between D. A. and controls probabilistic discounting of the $250 reward such that D. A. was less likely to select a risky offer; otherwise, there were no significant differences in probabil- ity discounting between the amnesic individuals and their respec- tive controls. These results suggest that despite the extent of hippocampal damage in these individuals, and the resulting degree of episodic amnesia, they were still capable of making decisions involving probabilistic outcomes similar to those of healthy controls, just as they were capable of making apparently normal decisions about future outcomes on delay discounting tasks. 250 _~ 250 _~ 250 e e & ~~ 200 = ok D200 ue D200 rs [ | + ae & Controls g - - Controls 2 Controls ow B o = = > o $ ea = = fe 5 9 (3) 3 a 38 2 aS s s 2 we @ D1 : + 0 5 10 15 20 Odds Against Odds Against Odds Against a e ae @ 2000 Ke @ 2000} _ & 2000 | = ZS -0- == 1600 == Controls & 1600 oe Cons 2 1600 0 Controls a a ow = > 1200 = c= & al. , 2010) .

Experiment 2 The preceding results from measures of impulsivity and risk taking (i. e. , delay and probability discounting tasks) provide in- sight into amnesic individuals decision making. Although they may have difficulty imagining specific personal experiences (Has- sabis et al. , 2007; Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Kwan et al. , 2012; Rabin et al. , 2012; Rosenbaum et al. , 2008) , they nonethe- less are capable of some future-oriented thinking when narrative construction is not required (Abraham et al. , 2008; Race et al. , 2013; Rosenbaum et al. , 2009) . Moreover, they are not especially prone to risky or impulsive decision making. Perhaps the inability to construct past and future narratives confines the individual with amnesia to a limited temporal orientation. An individual who cannot imagine the future, or who has never been able to imagine her future with clarity, might be expected to think of her life not in terms of long-term plans for the future but, rather, in terms of immediate experiences and pleasures. Being unable to imagine a past or their future, they would orient themselves disproportion- ately toward the present. To test this hypothesis, K. C. , D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. completed the ZTPI (Zimbardo individuals and their respective controls would suggest that the amnesic individuals are not abnormally focused on the present, other research suggests that delay discounting and time perspective constitute distinct forms of future thought (see Teuscher & Mitch- ell, 2011, for review) . Some aspects of future thinking, such as future scene construction, are much more sensitive to hippocampal damage than are other aspects of decision making. The issue here is how sensitive time perspective is to such damage. If the ability to construct future scenes and scenarios is a prerequisite for a future-oriented time perspective, for example, then one might expect that individuals with amnesia would adopt a present- centered, hedonistic attitude that minimizes consideration of future events. If individuals with amnesia have no store of evidence indicating that their actions are efficacious, however, one might expect them to adopt a present-fatalistic attitude in which nothing they do has any effect on how their future will unfold. Method Participants. The same four amnesic individuals as in Exper- iment | participated. Ten healthy, right-handed men matched for age (M = 55. 00, SD = 6. 09) and education (M = 16. 10, SD = 2. 51) served as controls for K. C. and D. A. The same 12 men who served as D. G. s controls in Experiment 1 also served as his controls in this experiment. H. C. s data were compared to existing norms from Zimbardo and Boyd s (1999) undergraduate sample. Procedure. Participants completed paper-and-pencil versions of the Belo, 2008; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) . Results and Discussion The ZTPI scores of K. C. , D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. and their respective controls are presented in Table 4. K. C. s highest score was on the Future time perspective scale, followed by the Past- Positive scale. Notably, his tendency toward future-oriented think- ing exists despite his inability to imagine future personal events in which he might participate. D. A. s highest score was on the Past-Positive time perspective scale, followed closely by the Fu- ture scale, even though he has a reduced ability to recall past experiences and to imagine future ones. Like K. C. and D. A. , D. G. most strongly endorsed Past-Positive time orientation. He endorsed both Present-Hedonistic and Future as secondary time perspectives. H. C. tended to strongly endorse items on the Past- Positive scale, despite significant difficulty reexperiencing past events, and her next highest score was on the Present-Hedonistic scale. Some of the heterogeneity in the time perspective profiles of the amnesic cases could reflect other factors known to correlate with time perspective, such as age and sex (Mello & Worrell, 2006) . For example, H. C. s second highest score was on the Present- Hedonistic time perspective scale, which may reflect her relative youth. Nevertheless, the results, with amnesic individuals highest scores in all cases being on the Future or Past-Positive scales, clearly are inconsistent with the idea that amnesia narrows one s temporal perspective to the present. Instead, the differences across the four amnesic individuals time perspective profiles indicate that time perspective represents a dispositional or attitudinal indi- vidual difference variable that need not involve the actual recol- lection of past experiences or the imagining of future experiences. Although none of the amnesic cases were biased most strongly toward the present, the ZTPI does have limitations in its ability to characterize amnesics time perspective. For example, there is debate over whether future time perspective, rather than reflecting a unitary construct, might be better characterized as a multidimen- sional construct (McCabe & Barnett, 2000; Seijts, 1998) , in which case the ZTPI fails to capture potential dissociations in future perspectives. It also should be noted that the lowest scores of the amnesic cases in the present study were on the ZTPI s Present- Fatalistic scale, and Worrell and Mello (2007) have raised the possibility that this scale relates more to low agency for changing the future rather than to a present orientation per se. Accordingly, this category may reflect a future rather than present-oriented time perspective. Although the varied nature of time perspective in episodic amnesia definitely warrants further research, these initial results for four amnesic individuals complement findings from more objective measures showing that the absence of episodic memory does not lead to a strictly present-oriented perspective. General Discussion We tested three individuals with hippocampal damage and ep- isodic amnesia, two with adult-onset amnesia (D. A. , D. G. ) , and a developmental case (H. one system, such as might occur with focal brain injury, if other systems are preserved. An application to the current study is that while deliberate, slow, conscious, cognitive processes (e. g. , episodic future thinking, Kah- neman s (2011) System 2) impact decision making, automatic, fast, unconscious, affective processes (i. e. , affective reaction to choice options, Kahneman s System 1) can still carry out decision making when System 2 processes are impaired (Kahneman, 2011) . Within our sample of amnesic individuals, we observed a range of strategies that reflect both rapid, affective processes (e. g. , de- cisions based on a gut feeling, as reported by K. C. and D. G. ) and slow, cognitive processes (e. g. , decisions based on financial calculations, as reported by D. A. , and some decisions based on spending for future events, as reported by H. C. ) . A multiple systems approach explains why our findings and those of others that, in contrast, do suggest a role for the hippocampus in dis- counting (i. e. , Peters & Biichel, 2010) are not mutually exclusive. Although amnesic individuals show intact performance on the present tests, this does not rule out the possibility that distortions in their temporal experience (i. e. , impaired episodic thought) could still have in some way affected their performance. It remains an 1366 open question whether experimental manipulations of episodic thought would have the same attenuating impact on the amnesic cases discounting as they have on that of asking a range of questions about the past, the present, and the future, and none of the amnesic individuals KWAN, CRAVER, GREEN, MYERSON, AND ROSENBAUM evidenced any difficulty understanding the questions or answering them in a reasonable way. Many of the questions on this test require that one grasp that the past is past (e. g. , I ve made mistakes in my past that I wish I could undo ) , that certain actions have deadlines (e. g. , I complete projects on time by making steady progress ) , and that future consequences result from actions taken in the present (e. g. , Before making a decision, I weight the costs against the benefits ) . Anecdotally, K. C. reports that future events will not always remain in the future because time moves on. Thus, even in the absence of the ability to construct possible future scenes or events, it apparently is possible to have semantic knowledge of one s place in time, of the temporal order of past, present, and future events, and of the consequences of one s actions. Furthermore, our results suggest that one can use such knowledge to guide choices in the present independently of episodic knowledge. Such evidence of semantic knowledge of time and the consequences of one s deci- sions shows that the familiar metaphors of being stuck in time or occupying a permanent present fail to do justice to the wealth of temporal competence displayed by individuals with episodic am- nesia. We were surprised to find that, given the nature of their impair- ments, none of the amnesic individuals in the current study iden- tified with either of the present-biased perspectives reflected in the ZTPI. There are several interpretations of what amnesic individu- als ZTPI scores could reflect beyond true subjective temporal orientation. There is the possibility that the amnesic individuals may have endorsed items for reasons other than temporal perspec- tive. For example, the item I believe that a person s day should be planned ahead each morning loads on the Future orientation factor, but the amnesic participants may have endorsed the state- ment because daily planning is a learned compensatory strategy for memory impairment. However, other future-oriented items that the amnesic individuals endorsed are inconsistent with this interpre- tation (e. g. , I keep working at difficult uninteresting work if it will help me get ahead ; Meeting tomorrow s deadline and doing other necessary work comes before tonight s play ; Before mak- ing a decision, I weight the costs against the benefits ; I am able to resist temptations when I know that there is work to be done ) . Likewise, it seems unlikely that H. C. , D. A. , and D. G. endorsed Past Positive items (e. g. , It gives me pleasure to think about my past ; Happy memories of good times spring readily to mind ; I get nostalgic about my childhood ) because of their episodic amnesia. It also is possible that the amnesic participants failed to endorse certain other items because of reasons other than time perspective. For example, amnesic individuals may have limited lifestyles, and their reduced involvement in social activities may have precluded them from endorsing certain present-oriented items. However, if the ZTPI results were confounded by the amnesic individuals limited behavior and lifestyle, one would have expected that am- nesic individuals time perspective would be anchored to the present. It is unclear why limited social activity would cause amnesic individuals to identify with being future-oriented, as was the case for K. C. and D. A. Another possible interpretation is that amnesic individuals re- sponded from the perspective of their premorbid selves and are thus reporting the time perspective of the person they used to be as opposed to the person they are at present. However, other DISSOCIATIONS IN FUTURE THINKING research shows that in the face of profound memory impairment, amnesic individuals have the ability to update self-trait knowledge to reflect their current state (e. g. , D. B. in Klein, Rozendal, & Cosmides, 2002; W. J. in Klein, Loftus, & Khilstrom, 1996; see Klein, 2010, for a review) . For example, when Tulving (1985) asked K. C. to report on his personality traits, K. C. s response corresponded with his current personality, and the accuracy of his ratings were verified by a high degree of correspondence between his responses and his mother s ratings of his postmorbid person- ality. In H. C. s case, moreover, the developmental origin of her hippocampal damage and resulting amnesia rule out the possibility that she is reporting premorbid temporal orientation; her hypoxic episode occurred at 1 week of age, and thus in her case, there is no premorbid self. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the ZTPI scores of the amnesic individuals in this study reflect their premorbid personalities. Finally, given the variable time perspectives with which K. C. , D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. identify, our findings suggest that neither amnesia nor the social consequences of amnesia have a consistent impact on subjective time perspective. Importantly, the current results establish that hippocampal damage, episodic amnesia, and an inability to imagine future experiences do not preclude appar- ently normal functioning of the future-oriented thought processes assessed here, and thus it is imprecise, if not incorrect, to describe such individuals as stuck in time.

Craver, Leonard Green, and Joel Myerson York University Washington University R. Shayna Rosenbaum York University and Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Recollecting past experiences and imagining future experiences activate a common set of brain regions that includes the hippocampus (Schacter, Addis, & Buckner, 2007) , and both functions are impaired in people with compromised hippocampal function (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Tulving, 1985) . These findings indicate a role for the hippocampus that extends beyond declarative memory. However, a case study revealed that a person with extensive medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage and episodic amnesia was able to forgo smaller, immediate rewards for a larger future payoff to a degree similar to control participants (Kwan et al. , 2012) . This finding suggests that typical regard for the future does not depend on hippocampal integrity. To test this hypothesis, the current study examined the nature and limits of the role of the hippocampus in future thinking and decision making in amnesic individuals with hippocampal damage and associated impairments in episodic memory and future imagining. The amnesic individuals were administered a delay discounting task to assess valuation of future rewards, a probability discounting task to assess risk taking, and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory to assess personal orientation toward contributions to memory research.

E-mail: d5kwan @yorku. ca or shaynar@yorku. ca 1355 partially accurate in characterizing the mental life of an amnesic person with hippocampal damage, it lacks precision in capturing the relation of memory to time. It is accurate in the sense that individuals with episodic amnesia are not only unable to recall past experiences, they also often are unable to imagine future experi- ences (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Kwan, Carson, Addis, & Rosenbaum, 2010; Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Tulving, 1985) . How- ever, it is unclear if and to what extent this deficit confines the amnesic individual s mental life to the here and now. Amnesia following damage to the hippocampus is most often characterized by impaired episodic memory for personal experi- ences of events, but semantic memory for facts about the world and oneself often is preserved (Bauer, 2008; Corkin, 2002; Rosen- baum, Murphy, & Rich, 2012; Tulving, 2002) . This dissociation of episodic from semantic memory deficits extends also to the ability to imagine the future. Although people with episodic amnesia have deficits in imagining their future experiences (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Kwan et al. , 2010; Race, Keane, & Verfaellie, 2011; Tulving, 1985; but see Cooper, Vargha-Khadem, Gadian, & Maguire, 2011; Hurley, Maguire, & Vargha-Khadem, 2011; Squire et al. , 2010) , they maintain the ability to imagine future public events and general facts that might be true at a future time 1356 (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Tulving, 1985; but see Cooper et al. , 2011; Hurley et al. , 2011; Squire et al. , 2010) , as long as they are not required to generate details relating to those events or facts (Race, Keane, & Verfaellie, 2013) . These clinical findings are in line with the results of neuroim- aging studies showing that the hippocampus is activated when participants recall episodic memories and imagine future personal experiences, but not when they recall general semantic facts and imagine generic or public facts about the future (Addis, Wong, & Schacter, 2007; Botzung, Denkova, & Manning, 2008; Okuda et al. , 2003; but see Abraham, Schubotz, & von Cramon, 2008) . Experimental studies in healthy children and adults also indicate a close correspondence between episodic memory and future imag- ining (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Atance & Jackson, 2009; Atance & O'Neill, 2001; Szpunar & McDermott, 2008) . Such findings support the view that the hippocampus is involved in mental time travel, which Tulving (2002) conceptualized as the ability to mentally transport one s self to real or imagined personal events in the past or future (see also Buckner & Carroll, 2007, and Ingvar, 1985) . Recent findings, however, complicate the idea of mental time travel as an ability subserved by an independent cognitive mech- anism. The difficulty stems from other research suggesting that mental one s emotional responses to such consequences. In Experiment 2, we measured personal attitudes and orienta- tions toward the past, present, and future using the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) . We com- pared results for the four amnesic individuals with those from demographically matched controls in order to determine which aspects of temporal thought and future-oriented decision making are preserved in individuals with hippocampal amnesia despite their inability to imagine detailed future experiences. Experiment 1 In Experiment 1, we investigated the extent to which individuals with hippocampal amnesia make risky or impulsive decisions, perhaps as a result of their inability to consider the future conse- quences of their decisions or to assign appropriate reward values to the consequences of their decisions. Delay and probability dis- counting tasks are well-established measures that assess decision making involving future and uncertain outcomes (for a review, see Green & Myerson, 2004) . Delay discounting, in which individuals choose between a smaller, immediate reward and a larger, delayed reward, refers to the decrease in the subjective value of the future reward as the delay until its receipt increases. There are differing ideas about how future imagining may influence delay discounting behavior. One view is that the ability to imagine one s future serves an evolutionary purpose in nudging decisions in favor of the future (Boyer, 2008) . Based on this hypothesis, one might expect that individuals with a future imagining impairment could be biased toward the immediate reward over the delayed reward. Alternatively, Luhmann, Chun, Yi, Lee, and Wang (2008) postu- late that imagining one s future in delay discounting is associated with the negative experience of waiting; to avoid that negative experience, individuals are thus biased toward present rewards. These two accounts make opposite predictions about how an inability to imagine one s future will influence delay discounting. Probability discounting, in which individuals choose between a smaller, certain reward and a larger, probabilistic reward, refers to the decrease in the subjective value of an uncertain reward as the odds against receiving it (i. e. , the probability of not receiving a reward) increases. Although it may be obvious that delay discount- ing involves considering future consequences, it may be less apparent how future considerations are involved in probability discounting. After all, in probability discounting, the outcomes are DISSOCIATIONS IN FUTURE THINKING immediate, regardless of whether one chooses the smaller, certain reward or whether one wins or loses the gamble on the larger probabilistic reward. It has been suggested, however, that people discount the value of probabilistic rewards because of the delay inherent in repeated gambles the lower the probability of a reward, the more times one might have to gamble before eventu- ally winning (Rachlin, Raineri, & Cross, 1991) . It also has been suggested that people show risk aversion (i. e. , they choose a certain reward of lower expected value over a larger probabilistic reward of higher expected value) because they seek to avoid future feelings of SD = 6. 24, M = 45. 42, SD = 4. 40, and M = 21. 67, SD = 1. 30, respectively) , education (M = 16. 2, SD = 2. 28, M = 16. 80, SD = 2. 23, and M = 12. 9, SD = 1. 00, respectively) , and handedness (all right-handed) . In addition, controls were matched on variables that predict performance on our measures of future thinking (ie. , gambling history, smoking status, and alcohol and drug use; Mad- den & Bickel, 2011) . All participants gave informed, written consent in accordance with the Human Research Ethics Commit- tees of York University and Baycrest and received monetary compensation or course credit for their time. Procedure. Delay discounting task. D. A. , D. G. , H. C. and their respec- tive controls completed a computerized version of an established measure of delay discounting (Green & Myerson, 2004) that was used previously to test K. C. (Kwan et al. , 2012) . Participants made a series of choices between two hypothetical monetary rewards a smaller, immediate amount and a larger, future amount. They were told that the task assesses preferences and that there are no correct or incorrect choices. As with K. C. in Kwan et al. (2012) , D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. completed this measure on multiple, separate occasions (six, three, and six administrations, respectively) in order to assess the consistency of the amnesic individuals re- sponses to rule out the possibility of highly variable performance affecting the interpretation of results. They did not explicitly recall their previous responses or having previously completed the task. For each of two future amounts ($100 and $2, 000) , participants made six choices for each of seven delays (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, | year, 3 years, and 10 years) presented in random order. For both the $100 and $2, 000 conditions, the amount of immediate reward judged equal in subjective value to the future reward was determined at each delay using an iterative, adjusting- amount procedure. In each condition, the size of the adjustment (i. e. , the decrease or increase in immediate reward amount) decreased with successive choices. The first adjustment was half of the difference between the amounts of the immediate and delayed rewards presented on the first trial, and the size of each subsequent adjustment was half that of the preceding adjustment, rounded to the nearest dollar. For example, in the condition with $2, 000 received in a year, the choice on the first trial would be between $2, 000 in a year and $1, 000 right now. If the participant chose the $2, 000 in a year, the choice on the second trial would be between $2, 000 in a year and $1, 500 KWAN, CRAVER, GREEN, MYERSON, AND ROSENBAUM right now. If the participant then chose $1, 500 right now, the choice on the third trial would be between $2, 000 in a year and $1, 250 right now. Following the sixth and last trial of each condi- tion, the subjective value of the delayed reward was estimated as the amount of immediate reward that would have been presented on the seventh trial. Probability discounting task. K. C. , D. A. , D. G. , and H. C. , and their respective control participants also completed a comput- erized version of an established measure of probability discounting (Green & Myerson, 2004) . Participants again were told that the task involved assessing preferences and that there were no correct or incorrect choices. Participants made a series of choices between two hypothetical monetary amounts: A smaller, certain or sure reward and a larger, probabilistic reward. For each of two probabilistic amounts ($250 and $2, 000) , participants made six choices at each of six probabilities (described to the participants as a 90%, 75%, 50%, 20%, 10%, and 5% chance) , presented in random order. For both the $250 and $2, 000 conditions, the amount of the certain reward judged equal in subjective value to the probabilistic reward was determined at each probability using an iterative, adjusting-amount procedure analogous to that used in the delay discounting task. The certain amount that would have been presented on a seventh trial was used as an estimate of the subjective value of the probabilistic reward at each probability. All of the rewards in this study were hypothetical, which raises the question of whether decisions would be made differently if rewards were real. Numerous studies have directly investigated this question by comparing hypothetical versus real rewards in discounting and other aspects of financial decision making (for a review, see Camerer, 1995) . These studies find no systematic difference in respective discount rates for delay discounting (M. W. Johnson & Bickel, 2002; Lagorio & Madden, 2005; Locey, Jones, & Rachlin, 2011; Madden, Begotka, Raiff, & Kastern, 2003; Madden et al. , 2004) or probability discounting (Hinvest & Anderson, 2010) . Further, one functional magnetic resonance im- aging (fMRI) study found that evaluating real and hypothetical rewards activated the same brain regions and that the BOLD signals in these regions were indistinguishable based on reward type (Bickel, Pitcock, Yi, & Angtuaco, 2009) . The use of hypo- thetical rewards in discounting research is thus likely to be valid and generalizable to real monetary rewards. Results and Discussion Delay discounting. Figure 2 shows the mean subjective val- ues of the delayed rewards for K. C. (taken from Kwan et al. , 2012) , D. A. , D. G. , H. C. , and their respective controls plotted as a function of delay for both the $100 (top panels) and $2, 000 (bottom panels) reward conditions. As may be seen, the amnesic individuals (like the controls) exhibited clear discounting of both the $100 and $2, 000 future rewards: In each case, the subjective value that the amnesic individuals placed on a reward decreased systematically as the delay until receiving the reward increased. In order to determine whether the amnesic individuals dis- counting differed from that of controls, for each participant we calculated the area under the curve (AuC; Myerson, Green, & Warusawitharana, 2001) for each future reward amount in each testing session.

Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) partition individuals temporal expe- rience into five distinct time perspectives: A past-negative per- spective that reflects a bias toward the past that is negative and aversive; a past-positive perspective that reflects a bias toward the past that is warm, sentimental, and nostalgic; a present-hedonistic perspective that reflects a bias toward the present and little concern with future consequences; a present-fatalistic perspective that re- flects a bias that is hopeless and helpless toward the future; and a future perspective that reflects a general forward-facing bias and includes striving toward future goals and rewards. Biases in time perspective have been hypothesized to influence individuals judgments, decisions, and actions. A present orienta- tion, for example, has been reported to be predictive of risky driving (Zimbardo et al. , 1997) and the use of substances such as alcohol, drugs, and tobacco (Keough, Zimbardo, & Boyd, 1999) . In part this may be because temporally distant events, including both past and future events, tend to be construed more abstractly (for a review, see Trope & Liberman, 2003) and are thus more likely to be evaluated in terms of cognitive goals rather than affective goals (Trope & Liberman, 2000) . The purpose of Experiment 2 was to determine if episodic amnesia biases one s perspective on time toward the present.

C. ; Kwan et al. , 2012) , performed within the range of demographically matched controls, systemat- ically discounting the value of future monetary rewards as the delay until their receipt increased. We then tested all four amnesic individuals on a probability discounting task involving monetary rewards, varying the likelihood of their receipt. Despite the role that the possibility of future regret has been hypothesized to play in such decisions (Loewenstein et al. , 2001) , all four amnesic individuals systematically discounted the value of probabilistic monetary rewards as the odds against their receipt increased, performing within the range of their respective controls. Finally, we assessed the time perspective of the four amnesic individuals and found that none of them had temporal orientations that were focused on the present. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that at least some aspects of future thinking are spared in episodic amnesia following extensive hippocampal damage despite deficits in episodic future imagining. Our results and other recent findings are consistent with an emerging view of the role of the hippocampus as revealed by the pattern of deficits and preserved functions in amnesic individuals. Amnesia is popularly understood as a loss of one s remembered past, but recent studies have shown that it can be associated with a loss of one s imagined future as well (Klein, Loftus, & Kihl- strom, 2002; Kwan et al. , 2010; Race et al. , 2011; Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Tulving, 1985, 2002) . It should be noted, however, that isolating the temporal component in remembering and imagining is fraught with methodological challenges. Previous work demon- strating impaired episodic memory and future imagining in amne- sia had used tasks that require both time consideration and narra- tive (re) construction (e. g. , Cooper et al. , 2011; Kwan et al. , 2010; DISSOCIATIONS IN FUTURE THINKING Maguire, Vargha-Khadem, & Hasabis, 2010) . This is problematic because at least some of the basic processes underlying the (re) construction of narratives and events appear to be hippocam- pally dependent, irrespective of time (Hassabis et al. , 2007; Ryan, Althoff, Whitlow, & Cohen, 2000) . Indeed, the hippocampus ap- pears to be critical for generating and binding together various event elements into a rich, integrated representation, even repre- sentations of events that are not specific to oneself or to a partic- ular point in time (Rosenbaum et al. , 2009; see also Race et al. , 2013) . Given that these (re) constructive abilities are impaired in indi- viduals with hippocampal amnesia, we tested amnesic individuals on tasks that require considering the future but that do not neces- sarily involve the (re) construction of events or scenes from one s remembered past or in one s imagined future. Our goal was to determine whether there are functionally dissociable forms of future thinking, some of which may depend on hippocampal epi- sodic memory, and some of which may not. Taken together, our findings show that indeed, future-regarding decision making can be preserved on tasks that isolate it from the requirement of narrative scene construction. Perhaps as a result of some preserved future-thinking ability (as evidenced, for example, by their deci- sion making on delay discounting tasks) , the time perspectives of amnesic individuals with hippocampal damage are not uniformly focused on the present. The current findings indicate a need to fractionate future imag- ining into distinct underlying parts in order to understand the role played by the hippocampus. With respect to the consequences of hippocampal damage, we propose that the crux of the deficit is in basic, internally driven constructive processes in the retrieval and binding of details, which are common to episodic memory, future imagining, and imagining in general. It may also be that the well-established dissociations between semantic and episodic ele- ments in memory are true of future thinking (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002) . Notably, the discounting tasks used in the cur- rent study, and on which people with hippocampal damage showed apparently normal function, capture predominately semantically mediated aspects of future thought. Thus, our findings support Klein, Loftus, and Kihlstrom s (2002) assertion that semantic memory alone can support a host of future-thinking abilities so long as they do not require temporal awareness of one s own experience. Moreover, both the patterns of intact and impaired performance in the case that Klein, Loftus, and Kihlstrom report, and the hippocampal amnesic individuals reported here, indicate that future thinking is not a unitary construct or natural kind. With respect to the neural structures subserving future-regarding thought, there is emerging evidence that MTL and frontal lobe regions play unique roles. MTL structures, and the hippocampus in particular, appear to occupy a central role in atemporal aspects of future thinking (or imagining in general) such as those mentioned above. In contrast, medial prefrontal cortex appears to be selec- tively important for subjective, conscious, experiential aspects of future thinking, and time-based thought in general (e. g. , Fellows & Farrah, 2005; Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1997) . For example, Nyberg, Kim, Habib, Levine, & Tulving (2010) used fMRI to investigate neural patterns associated one s consciousness of dif- ferent moments in subjective time. In that study, participants recollected walking a familiar route and also imagined walking the same route in the hypothetical past, present, and future. They were 1365 not required to (re) construct a narrative of the event. Nyberg et al. found that activity in the left frontal and parietal cortices, along with the cerebellum and thalamus, distinguished different imag- ined time states from the present. Importantly, they found no hippocampal involvement in the representation of subjective time, a result consistent with the present finding of apparently intact time perspectives following hippocampal damage. Amnesia and Decision Making Hippocampal-dependent memory has long been studied in cog- nitive psychology, but its application to understanding complex economic behavior is a relatively new endeavor. The current findings provide insight into the strategies and processes underly- ing widely used economic judgment tasks such as delay discount- ing and probability discounting (i. e. , intertemporal choice and risky choice measures) . For example, recent {MRI studies demon- strate that hippocampally mediated episodic future thinking occu- pies a role in decision making for both real rewards (Peters & Biichel, 2010) and hypothetical rewards (Benoit, Gilbert, & Bur- gess, 2011) , but it is unclear whether this role is necessary or merely modulatory; our findings build on these studies by sug- gesting the latter. Further, the fact that we found no significant difference in delay or probability discounting between amnesic individuals and healthy controls indicates that such modulatory effects are relatively slight. Together, our results and those show- ing an effect of hippocampally mediated future thinking on deci- sion making, support a multiple systems approach to decision making where automatic and controlled processes can work in tandem to produce a decision (see Sanfey & Chang, 2008; Weber & Johnson, 2009, for reviews) . In the context of delay discounting, there are likely multiple concurrent mechanisms that enable or modulate future-oriented decision making, and episodic future thinking may be just one of several such mechanisms. Weber and colleagues propose that multiple decision modes co-exist, ranging from increasingly affect-based to increasingly analytical (Weber & Lindemann, 2007) . An extension of this idea is that decision making may consist of redundant processes and thus can withstand selective compromise of healthy adults. Adding such experimental manipulations to standard discounting tasks will allow us to better characterize the nature of discounting in amnesia and, accordingly, the relative contributions of a conscious System 2 process (i. e. , episodic memory/future thinking) to decision making. Indeed, there are several theories in the behavioral economics literature that implicate a role for mental construction and memory in decision making, although the precise cognitive mechanisms are unclear. For example, preference construction postulates that de- cisions are not made according to predetermined, rational prefer- ences but rather are constructed at the moment of decision. More- over, the construction of preferences is context-dependent and vulnerable to a range of biases (see Slovic, 1995) . A relevant extension of preference construction is Query Theory, which ar- gues that people draw on memory processes to construct prefer- ences (Weber et al. , 2007) . The framing of decision parameters affects the order in which people retrieve relevant contents from memory; the order in which people retrieve contents from memory ultimately biases their decisions such that initially retrieved con- tents are weighted more heavily. The study of amnesic individuals could provide one way to examine the assumptions of Query Theory. Patterns of impaired episodic memory but relatively intact semantic memory in hip- pocampal amnesia would give insight into the nature of the mem- ory retrieval processes (i. e. , output interference) that according to Query Theory, underlie certain features of normal decision making (ie. , endowment effects, E. J. Johnson, Hiubl, & Keinan, 2007; asymmetric discounting, Appelt, Hardisty, & Weber, 2011; Weber et al. , 2007; and framing effects, Hardisty, Johnson, & Weber, 2010) . The purpose of the current effort was to determine whether a group of amnesic individuals, varying in age, sex, and etiology, would all demonstrate discounting behavior comparable to that of controls, despite an impaired ability to imagine future experiences. As such, we did not manipulate features of normal discounting, and it remains an important question for future research whether amnesic individuals demonstrate effects of query order like those observed in healthy controls. Amnesia and Time Perspective In this study we found that hippocampal damage and the result- ing impairments in episodic memory and future imagining did not appear to systematically affect amnesic individuals subjective time perspectives. These findings pose problems for the view that episodic memory is necessary for an individual to grasp or to learn indexical temporal notions such as the past, the present, and the future (Hoerl, 1999; McTaggart, 1908) or the idea that events in the future become present and fade into the past. According to this view, individuals with no memories for past experiences lack the data required to construct the idea that time passes (Hoerl, 1999) . Our results show, however, that amnesic individuals are capable of taking the future consequences of their actions into account and, further, that they seem to understand the crucial differences be- tween the past, the present, and the future.

Amnesic confabulatory syndrome after focal basal forebrain damage Article abstract A 73-year-old woman developed amnesic confabulatory syndrome after a right focal basal forebrain hemorrhage. The confabulation, despite persistent antegrade amnesia, gradually subsided with improvement of the frontal executive function. The lesion appeared to disrupt connections of the medial and lateral limbic circuits important for memory. Simultaneous dysfunctioning of the two circuits involving the medial temporal and frontal lobes may be necessary for the development of this syndrome. Key words: Basal forebrain Amnesia Confabulation Hemorrhage. NEUROLOGY 2000; 54: 978-980 Ritsuo Hashimoto, MD; Yasufumi Tanaka, MD; and Imaharu Nakano, MD In basal forebrain amnesics, spontaneous confabula- tion is frequent, particularly in the acute period. ! The patients reported thus far usually had large le- sions involving multiple neuroanatomic areas be- yond the basal forebrain, ? leaving it unclear whether the basal forebrain lesion alone caused the specific amnesic confabulatory syndrome. We present a pa- tient who exhibited this syndrome after hemorrhage restricted to the right basal forebrain. Case report. A 73-year-old fully right-handed woman was admitted to our hospital in June 1996 because she had suddenly become forgetful 2 days earlier. On admission, the patient was alert and had no focal neurologic deficit. During superficial conversation she ap- peared normal, but a clinical mental examination showed disorientation about the date along with disturbed recent memory. The patient said herself that she was forgetful but did not appear to worry about it. During her 1-month stay at our hospital, the patient fabricated spontaneously. Much of her confabulation was closely associated with her previous occupation as a tele- phone operator. In one interview, the patient suddenly got embarrassed and told the examiner, There s a young woman waiting in another room whom I should teach how to work as a telephone operator. On another occasion, she was found wandering around a neurosurgical ward, where she asserted that there should be a telephone office at which she had worked until the day before as an operator. A nurse had to explain many times that the place was a From the Department of Neurology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. Received June 7, 1999. Accepted in final form October 15, 1999.

Because the patient could correctly state her age, she recognized that she was too old to work and had retired 45 years before. Neuropsychological assessment. On evaluation, the pa- tient was attentive and cooperative. Her language function was intact. She could repeat five digits forward and four digits backward. Her verbal IQ on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) was 98, and the per- formance IQ was 96. Her verbal memory quotient on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) (Japanese ver- sion) was 72 and that of visual memory was 76. Although her general intelligence was preserved, the patient had antegrade memory disturbance in both verbal and visual materials as determined by the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) (Japanese version) ? and the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test (R-O CFT) . In the AVLT, she could remember 7 out of 15 presented words in the first trial but did not show any learning effect in consecutive trials. The patient made errors in the first trial, and the same errors frequently appeared in consecutive trials. Immediately af- ter an interference trial with another set of 15 words, she was asked to recall words in the first set. Her responses consisted of some words from the first and second sets of words mixed with some of the errors that she had made in the previous trials. The public event test and autobio- graphical memory questionnaire, including questions re- garding marriage, deaths of relatives, and birth dates of her children, indicated no evidence of significant retro- grade amnesia. As for the frontal lobe function, the patient showed deficits in the New Modified Wisconsin Card Sort- ing Test and the Trail making test part B (table) . Neuroimaging study. MRI at 10 days after the stroke showed cerebral hemorrhage confined to the right basal forebrain (figure) . According to a standard atlas, the le- sion involved the diagonal band of Broca, septal nuclei, nucleus basalis of Meynert, nucleus accumbens, and preop- tic area, and the adjoining white matter.

SPECT with 1? J-labeled isoprophyl-iodo-amphetamine (7?8]-IMP) 2 weeks after the stroke demonstrated hypoper- fusion in the right medial temporal lobe and right medial orbitofrontal area. Follow-up assessment. When the patient underwent the second assessment at 3 months after the stroke, the patient s confabulation gradually subsided and was clini- cally minimum. In contrast to her persistent amnesia, the patient performed better than before in the tests examin- ing the frontal executive function (see table) . Discussion. It is generally accepted that patients with unilateral medial temporal or diencephalic le- sions develop material-specific amnesia (verbal for left-sided lesions; visual for right-sided lesions) . If this were also applicable to amnesic patients with a basal forebrain lesion, our patient should mainly ex- hibit visual amnesia. However, her performance in recalling verbal material was as defective as for vi- sual material, similar to previous patients with a discrete right basal forebrain lesion. * Thus, amnesic patients with a basal forebrain lesion may be less subject to the laterality of a lesion than ones with a medial temporal or diencephalic lesion. ?7* The most notable feature in this patient was the confabulation. She appeared to have difficulty in dis- tinguishing between thoughts and external real events. At a time when she was confabulating ac- tively, she made many intrusive errors in the AVLT and seemed defective in the time tagging of informa- tion. The availability of contextual memories may depend on the recording of separate stimuli that compose a perceived episode, the computation and recording of relationships between multiple compo- nents, and some form of time tagging of those records. ? The patient might have deficits in the sec- ond and third requirements, thereby permitting her thoughts or old episodic memories to intrude on her real experiences, resulting in the intrusive errors in the AVLT and the confabulation. In other words, the patient might have been unable to monitor and with- hold inappropriate responses in both the time and space domains. Mediated by the frontal lobe would be a stronger way to present this because her confabulation subsided as her frontal executive function improved. The patient had a lesion that seemingly involved the diagonal band of Broca, septal nuclei, nucleus basalis of Meynert, preoptic area, nucleus accum- bens, stria terminalis, and medial forebrain bundle. Also, we could not rule out a possibility that the injury, to some extent, occurred in the terminal zone of the fornix. Because the septal nuclei and nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca are primary sources of cholinergic input to the hippocampus, damage to these structures may cause dysfunctioning of the hippocampal region by depriving the hippocampus of cholinergic innervation. The nucleus accumbens re- ceives input from the hippocampus and amygdala and projects to the ventral pallidum, which in turn sends efferents to the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus. \" The medial forebrain bundle is believed to convey ascending influences from the brainstem reticular activating system to the septal nuclei, which are thought to have reciprocal connections with the hippocampus via the fornix. The stria ter- minalis is a primary efferent pathway from the amygdala, which terminates in the preoptic area. Thus, it is implied that the lesion disrupted the con- nections and caused dysfunctioning of the two limbic circuits important for memory: the medial limbic circuit involving the medial temporal lobe and the February (2 of 2) 2000 NEUROLOGY 54 979 lateral limbic circuit involving the anterior temporal cortex and amygdala, dorsomedial nucleus, and or- bitofrontal cortex. 1 The SPECT results showing hy- poperfusion in the right medial temporal lobe and the medial orbitofrontal area seem consistent with this contention. There is evidence that the medial temporal lobe plays a leading role in the organization of memory. ! Moreover, studies imply that the frontal lobe contrib- utes to the memory function in a specific way, such as time tagging of information or self-generation of responses. ! Previous studies indicate that dysfunc- tioning of either the frontal lobe or medial temporal lobe alone does not cause such an amnesic confabula- tory syndrome as that seen in our patient. ' The present study suggests that simultaneous dysfunc- tioning",

        "case_report": "(Beatty and Carbone, 1980; Kelsey and Landry, 1988; Brito et al. , 1983; McLamb et al. , 1988) . In humans, lesions of the septal region have repeatedly been described in cases of ruptured aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) (Gade, 1982; Alexander and Freedman, 1984; Damasio et al. , 1985; Corkin et al. , 1985) . A PET study of two patients with amnesia after rupture and repair of ACoA aneurysm indicated a secondary remote effect on mediobasal temporal struc- tures (Volpe et al. , 1984) . Thus, an indirect effect on the HF may finally be res- ponsible for memory dysfunctions observed in these basal forebrain cases. ' Following the definition proposed by Amaral and Witter (1989) we subsume under the hippocampal formation four relatively simple cortical regions: (1) the dentate gyrus, (2) the hippocampus proper (CA3, CA2, CAI) , (3) the subicular complex and (4) the entorhinal cortex. Cortex, (1992) 28, 411-422 412 D. Y. von Cramon and U. Schuri Lesions within the human septal region are not restricted to nuclear struc- tures but may include a multitude of neuromediator-containing fibres travers- ing this region, among them NE- or 5-HT-containing fibres from the brainstem on their way down to the HF (Nieuwenhuys, 1985) . A case underlining the relevance of an intact septal region to explicit me- mory and learning functioning in humans was published by Phillips et al. (1987) . Following the repair of a ruptured ACoA aneurysm their patient devel- oped anterograde amnesia, apathy (loss of volition) and partial diabetes insi- pidus. Postmortem examination of the brain revealed infarctions in the supply area of the ACoA with destruction of the septal gray, the nucleus of the dia- gonal band, the nucleus accumbens, a small rostro-ventral portion of the glo- bus pallidus, and a central segment of the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The most caudal extent of the lesion spared the anterior commissure and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The remainder of the brain was unremarkable. A second case hinting at the septal region as a potential memory-relevant neural structure was recently published by Berti et al. (1990) . Their patient de- veloped anterograde amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the septum pellucidum. Neuroimaging procedures did not show any major lesion of brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Over a period of four months after surgery the patient had not shown any improvement in standard memory tests apart from paired-associates learning. In our opinion the lesion included the upper part of the septal region damaging the septal nuclei but pres- umably sparing the nucleus of the diagonal band. Fibre projections interconnecting the medial septal/diagonal band complex and other traversing pathways with the HF follow two different routes. The majority of fibres pass through the fornix-fimbria system, smaller contingents enter the supracallosal longitudinal striae (as part of the supracommissural hip- pocampus) , and the cingulate bundle. These parallel fibre bundles constitute the dorsal route. In some species (e. g. in cats) septal fibres travel to cranial parts of the HF along a ventral route through the ansa peduncularis and the amygdala (Gage et al. , 1984) . If it is true that the interaction between the septal region and HF is indis- pensable for the maintenance of normal memory and learning mechanisms in humans, a disruption of some combination of these septo-hippocampal fibre projections, especially a disruption of the dorsal route, should crucially deter- iorate explicit memory functions. The aim of this paper is to present a case who may credit to this assumption. Case REPORT Patient On September 16, 1990 D. C. , a 25-year-old, right-handed car mechanic awoke with a splitting headache. He was transferred to a hospital. Lumbar puncture yielded blood-stained CSF. Urine and blood studies, including clotting studies, were normal. His past medical his- tory was noncontributory. He had moderate meningism, was somnolent and disoriented. Spontaneous speech, comprehension and repetition were normal. He had no abnormal mo- tor signs or alterations in reflexes. Pain sensation was intact. Septohippocampal pathways and memory 413 Cranial computer tomography revealed fresh blood in the left lateral ventricle. A four- vessels magnification angiography displayed an arterio-venous malformation (AVM) in the atrium of the left ventricle. Feeding arteries arose from the left posterior pericallosal and posterior choroidal arteries, the draining vessel was the enlarged left internal cerebral vein. On September 26, 1990 the AVM was removed through a left occipito-parietal cranioto- my. The neurosurgeon decided on an access from the left superior parietal lobule. After hav- ing dissected the upper parietal white matter and the isthmus of the corpus callosum, he found a vascular malformation rising from the choroidal plexus of the left atrium. During the operative preparation of the malformation the partially necrotized left fornix and a por- tion of its (fornical) commissure ruptured. Postoperative magnification angiography confirmed the total removal of the vascular malformation. A hemorrhage on the first postoperative day broadened out the access lesion to a cylindric necrosis measuring up to 3 cm in diameter. Following this complication the pa- tient developed a mild right-sided hemiparesis, which had receded six months later. Elemen- tary somatosensory perception was normal. General Neuropsychological Test Results When admitted to our department (3 months after surgery) , tactile-kinaesthetic object recognition (stereognosis) with the right hand was abolished. Six months later the stereoag- nosis was virtually unchanged. D. C. had a right-sided homonymous hemianopsia for white light with a residual visual field of 3 degrees visual angle on the horizontal axis. When re- tested 6 months later, his visual field for white light was normal. The visual fields for color and form, however, remained shrunken with only 24 degrees eccentricity on the horizontal axis. Visual search was not obviously impaired; the patient searched visual targets in both hemifields up to 52 degrees eccentricity. Initially D. C. showed a high error rate when estimating angles and matching positions of dot patterns. He had no optic ataxia. When retested 6 months later, his visual-spatial abili- ties were no longer impaired. The patient obtained a percentile score of 0 in the Zahlenverbindungstest (ZVT, Os- wald and Roth, 1978) , an extended German version of part A of the Trail Making Test . When retested 6 months later, he did nearly as poor as before (percentile score 1) . On the Paced Serial Addition Task (PASAT, Gronwall and Wrightson, 1974) , however, he reached a percentile of 37. Thus, his information processing ability was not generally reduced. At ad- mittance general intelligence tested with the Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1956) was above average (JQ 112) . He performed well on categorization tasks (Weig] Test, De Renzi et al. , 1966; Modified-Card-Sorting-Test, Nelson, 1976) but did less well in a transformation task (Tower-of-Hanoi puzzle/four-disk version, Spitz et al. , 1982) . We observed a striking lack of motivation in the sense that particularly his goal striving behaviour was reduced (Gollwitzer, 1992) . We also suspected a lack of emotional reactivity, since the patient was particularly poor at verbalizing his emotional state. Memory and Learning Ability The patient was examined with a Memory-Test-Battery which covered a wide range of mnemonic aspects. Tests were applied at admittance to our department (3 months post sur- gery) and again 6 months later. Working Memory (see Table I) Initially, D. C. had a normal digit span, while free recall of a word list and the patient s performance in the Corsi block tapping test were below average. When retested, free recall of the word list remained impaired. Additional investigation of verbal working memory re- 414 D. Y. von Cramon and U.

C. had difficulties in recalling the final words in a set of unrelated sentences, which he previously had read ( Reading span : Daneman and Carpenter, 1980; Ehrhard, 1988) . Verbal Memory and Learning (see Table II) When first tested, D. C. s performance was reduced in all tests of verbal memory and learning. Results were better in immediate free recall of a 57-unit story and in two recogni- tion tests (California Verbal Learning Test: Delis et al. , 1987; Ilmberger, 1988; Recurring Words Test, Stollmann, 1990) . His performamnce was especially poor in three subtests of the highly demanding Lern und Gedachtnis-Test (LGT-3 of Baumler, 1974; modified version: Meier, 1987) . The patient must learn and remember (for about 20 minutes) some Turkish words, telephone numbers and details from a written text. When retested after six months, the general pattern of results remained the same, although D. C. now reached an average lev- el in immediate story recall and in the Recurring words test. The recall of the 57-unit story after 48 hours remained considerably impaired.

Septohippocampal pathways and memory 415 Memory and Learning of Non-verbal Material (see Table III) At the admittance, D. C. s performance was deficient in a nonverbal selective reminding task (Muramoto, 1984) in which the patient should learn the position of ten small objects hidden under film cups. In contrast, recognition memory for faces was normal and for var- ious designs (Recurring figures test: Kimura, 1963; Hartje and Rixecker, 1978) only slightly impaired. Performance in two subtests of the LGT-3 (learning and retention of a short path and of figural paired associates} was very poor. When reexamined, the patient achieved a normal level in the Recurring figures test while the results in the two subtests of the LGT-3 remained poor. D. C. was unable, despite several attempts, to recall the Rey-Osterrieth fi- gure (Complex Figure Test; Osterrieth, 1944; Lezak, 1983) after he had copied it very accur- ately.

No data available. Implicit Memory D. C. was tested with a computer-assisted mirror drawing task, where he was asked to connect as fast as possible the numbers 1 to 20, presented on the screen, with the help of a mouse turned 180 deg (Gatzweiler et al. , 1990) . He showed a normal learning curve saving 22 sec between trial 1 and trial 10 (mean value for normal controls 17 sec; SD = 12 sec) . In addition, we gave him the Incomplete Pictures Test (Gollin, 1960) in the modified ver- sion of Henke and Markowitsch (in preparation) . Eighteen drawings of increasingly identi- fiable objects were presented in 10 versions (steps) . The patient was asked to name the ob- jects as soon as he recognized them. At a first presentation of the objects D. C. needed an average of 5. 7 steps. When retested, the objects were recognized 2. 4 steps earlier, indicating a normal priming effect (Saving of normal controls 2. 5 steps; SD = 0. 47) . Remote Memory Autobiographical memory revealed an almost complete loss of information from the two months prior surgery. Otherwise, major personal events were preserved, although some de- tails, particularly events of the preceding year, were no longer available. His domain-specific (professional) knowledge was by and large spared. 416 D. Y, von Cramon and U. Schuri Fig. 1A - Sagittal MRI images in case D. C. on four contiguous sagittal cuts: 8mm/16mm left para- sagittal (top left/right) , midline (bottom left) , and 8mm right parasagittal (bottom right) . See text for de- tails. Magnetic Resonance Tomography (9 months after surgery) Serial T1-weighted (TE 20; TR SE 461) coronal, sagittal and horizontal images were per- formed on a Philips Gyroscan 515. The coronal sections were obtained perpendicular to the fronto-occipital (FO) -line. The sagittal cuts illustrate the left-sided access lesion extending from the superior parie- tal lobule through the medial portion of the upper parietal white matter and the posterior cingulum (cingulate bundle) to the uppermost level of the thalamus (nucleus lateralis dor- salis, nucleus lateralis posterior, nuclei pulvinares?) . Isthmus and part of the splenium cor- poris callosi are completely removed on the left side. Hence, damage to the left-sided supra- commissural hippocampus (medial and lateral longitudinal striae, indusium griseum) can be derived, The right parasagittal section (Figure 1a; bottom right) makes it plausible that the right crus fornicis was spared. The coronal sections confirm the previously described limbic and paralimbic lesions. Moreover, damage to the tail of the left caudate nucleus and to the parietal portion of the optic radiation seems likely. The left temporal horn (of the lateral ventricle) is clearly wi- dened. The left HF, however, appears unremarkable. Septohippocampal pathways and memory 417 Discussion Our patient D. C. can be considered as amnesic in the sense that he exhibits an explicit memory disorder characterized particularly by an impairment of learning ability (anterograde amnesia) . Other cortical functions such as in- telligence, language, motor abilities were largely preserved. This pattern of predominantly verbal memory and learning deficits resem- bles the findings we obtained for a group of 12 left-sided posterior cerebral ar- tery infarctions with lesions centering on posterior portions of the HF (von Cramon et al. , 1988) . However, these patients never had a complete retrograde amnesia and all had been fully aware of the consequences of their memory dis- ability. One can speculate that D. C. s poor metamemory does not reflect true una- wareness of cognitive deficits but rather his lack of motivation and reduced emotional reactivity. In principle D. C. knew about his memory problems but did not pay very much attention to it. It seems plausible to relate some goal striving deficit to the large left-sided cingular lesion which involves both the posterior cingular cortex and the posterior cingulate bundle. Goal striving is be- havior directed towards existing goals, and addresses questions not only of lo- comotion toward the chosen goal, but also of frustration, reaching a goal (Gollwitzer, 1992) . D. C. s pattern of results in memory and learning tasks might be explained in this context, too. Recognition is mentally less demanding than free recall. Re- trieving a whatever story after 48 hours is obviously more laborious than its im- mediate recall. Reorganizing the Rey-Osterrieth figure from memory appears more strenuous than copying it. We indeed believe that D. C. tended to avoid de- manding encoding and retrieval processes. Though, the facts are not that simple as he never refused to participate in a test and always tried to end up even with difficult tasks. We should also mention that he performed normally on the PAS- AT, a rather demanding cognitive task. Nonetheless, motivational-emotional factors seem to have more contributed to his cognitive disturbances than when he had suffered a left-sided posterior cerebral artery infarction. At the admittance D. C. was impaired not only in verbal but also in several nonverbal memory tests. When retested after 6 months, his performance had improved in most of the non-verbal tasks. For the initial period one could ar- gue that the processing of figural material was partly impeded by his right-sided homonymous hemianopsia and visual perceptual deficits, presumably related to the left superior parietal lesion. Another explanation derives from the fact that under the splenium of the corpus callosum a number of fornical fibres de- cussate to the opposite side, thus constituting the commissure of the fornix (Nieuwenhuys et al. , 1988) . As mentioned above a portion of the fornical com- missure had ruptured. Despite the predominantly left-sided lesion of the dorsal route, the interruption of commissural fornical fibres might have some detri- mental effects on activities in the right-sided HF. This case credits to the hypothesis that even unilateral damage to the dorsal route of septo-hippocampal projections interferes with normal explicit memory functions in humans. 418 D. Y. von Cramon and U. Schuri Fig. 1B - Four coronal MRI images in case D. C. through the anterior (up left) and posterior (up right) 3rd ventricle, through the quadrigeminal cistern (bottom left) , and the trigone of the lateral ventricles (bottom right) . See text for details. The question arises whether memory dysfunctions depended on the com- mon disruption of all three pathways (cingulate bundle, supracommissural hip- pocampus, fornix) constituting the dorsal route or on one of its fibre compo- nents. We indeed believe that the likelihood for severe and persistent memory dysfunction increases with the number of fibre components of the dorsal septo- hippocampal route disrupted. This assumption does not exclude that acute le- sions of single fibre components may be followed by modality-specific (or ma- terial-specific) explicit memory dysfunctions. Impaired memory has been reported following so-called exclusive bilater- al fornix damage. Heilman and Sypert (1977) , for instance, presented an am- nesic woman who suffered from a spongioblastoma in the subarachnoid space of the quadrigeminal cistern. The neoplasm arose in the hippocampal commis- sure or pineal body, destroying the posterior fornix bilaterally. A selective le- sion of the proximal fornix is highly unlikely in this case. A space-occupying splenial tumour damaging the subsplenial portion of the proximal fornix al- Septohippocampal pathways and memory 419 most inevitably injures the gyrus fasciolaris and the fasciola cinerea. These structures are the continuation of the supracommissural hippocampus. If the adjacent cingulate isthmus was also injured in this case, which is rather likely, the posterior cingulate bundles might have also been disrupted. The case Tuck- er et al. (1988) have published cannot be considered as a pure fornical lesion either. Besides the left-sided transection of the proximal fornix by a malignant astrocytoma the posterior HF itself was said to be injured in this case. In this context, we should also mention the cases of Hodges and Carpenter (1991) . The authors described two patients who developed anterograde amnesia following an apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns, demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, seemed obvious. Other memory related structures were said to be entirely normal. The sagittal images of both cases (cf Figure 2 of the paper of Hodges and Carpenter, 1991) support the assumption that the septal region as well as the su- pracallosal hippocampus might additionally be damaged partly by the IIIrd ven- tricle colloid cyst partly by the transcallosal-transventricular surgical man- oeuvre. Thus, the persistently impaired verbal memory in these cases may be due to acombined lesion of the septal region and at least one of the dorsal route fibre projections (i. e. the fornix) . Several fornical cases have been documented in which memory was apparently intact although these reports provided insuffi- cient neuropsychological data (Garcia-Bengochea and Friedman, 1987; Woolsey and Nelson, 1975) . Woolsey and Nelson reported on a man with a metastasis of a lung tumour measuring up to 1. 5 cm in diameter, located in and replacing the posterior columns of the fornix. Microscopic examination showed that virtually all of the body of the fornix was replaced by adenocarcinoma. The fimbria bila- terally contained an excess of fibrillary astrocytes, suggesting a certain amount of fibre degeneration. The absence of anterograde amnesia might have been due to the fact that a sufficient number of compensatory septo-hippocampal inter- connections (cingulate bundle, supracommissural hippocampus, ventral route) remained intact. This assumption does not exclude that a more careful neurop- sychologic examination might have revealed some definite memory impairment. With respect to the anterior cingula Ballantine et al. (1967) provided abun- dant evidence that major destruction of these structures (including the cingu- late bundles arising from the septal region) only transiently affected memory. An ischemic destruction of the splenium and the posterior body of the cor- pus callosum is a rather unique event. Degos et al. (1987) published such a case. At the time of admission the (75-year-old) patient had been unable to retain questions that she had been asked five minutes earlier, nor could she describe the various homes in which she had lived over the years. Four months after the infarction her memory was apparently intact. Though, memory and learning functions had not been formally tested. Since the posterior supracommissural hippocampus is supplied by the same posterior pericallosal branches which caused the posterior callosal infarction, an additional damage to the posterior supracallosal striae is rather likely. The cingulate bundle, the fimbria-fornix system as well as the septum and the HF were said to be'spared in this case. Von Cramon et al. (1990) examined a woman with a small hemorrhage from a ruptured cryptic angioma in the left retrosplenial area. On early CT-scans 420 D. Y. von Cramon and U, Schuri blood was found in the left lateral ventricle, indicating a disruption of the left portion of the splenium. MRI scans illustrated a circumscribed lesion mainly destroying the left posterior cingulum. Additional damage to the retrosplenial cortex could not be excluded. Initially, verbal learning and memory functions were considerably impaired. Six months post-onset her test performance had normalized in all psychometric aspects. We concluded from this case that a re- trosplenial disruption of the posterior cingulate bundle produces memory and learning dysfunction, but has no permanent effect. It were Valenstein et al. (1987) who introduced the concept of Retrosplen- ial Amnesia . The authors observed their patient T. R. over a period of 22 months. He developed retrograde and anterograde amnesia following hemor- rhage from an arterio-venous malformation situated near the splenium of the corpus callosum. MRI studies demonstrated damage to the splenium and to a region containing the retrosplenial cortex and the posterior cingulate bundle. The fornix was anterior and inferior to the site of the maximal damage but, as the authors admitted, may have been involved. The HF, the thalamus and the basal forebrain were spared by the lesion. The authors suggested that the thal- amo-cortical portion of Papez circuit may be important in memory, and that lesions of the cingulum and retrosplenial cortex may cause amnesia by disrupt- ing this pathway. We would like to suggest an expanded hypothesis. It seems plausible that amnesia in patient T. R. was due to a combined disruption of the dorsal septo- hippocampal route including the posterior cingulum, the supracommissural hippocampus and the proximal fornix. CONCLUSIONS There are several lines of evidence that the septo-hippocampal interconnec- tions play a major role in the maintenance of normal functions of the HF in hu- mans. Lesions of the septal/diagonal band complex and its interconnections with the HF seem to produce behavioral changes comparable to those following lesions of the HF itself with the exception that motivational-emotional! factors seem to have a greater impact on memory and learning performance. The likelihood for severe and persistent memory dysfunction presumably increases with the complete disruption of the dorsal (septo-hippocampal) route. Lesions of single fibre components including the fornix may not be a sufficient condition for lasting anterograde amnesia. A unilateral left-sided lesion of the dorsal route does not produce exclusively modality-specific deficits. The decus- sation of fibres in the fornical commissure could explain why some nonverbal memory functions were impaired in our case. ABSTRACT The interaction between the septal region and the hippocampal formation appears indis- pensable for the maintenance of normal memory and learning mechanisms in humans. The Septohippocampal pathways and memory 421 disruption of some combination of septo-hippocampal pathways, especially the disruption of the dorsal route , deteriorates explicit memory functions. The case of a 25-year-old male patient is presented who developed anterograde and to a certain extent retrograde amnesia following rupture and repair of an arteriovenous malfor- mation in the atrium of the left ventricle. A left-sided lesion of the dorsal route involving the posterior cingulate bundle, the longitudinal striae (as part of the supracommissural hippo- campus) and the fornix appeared responsible for his mnemonic deficits. The implications of these findings for the understanding of other clinical cases, parti- cularly those with lesions of the septal region, the anterior and posterior cingular gyrus/cin- gulate bundie and the fornix are discussed.

Yves von Cramon and Uwe Schuri (City Hospital Bogenhausen, Department of Neuropsychology, Munich) INTRODUCTION The medial septal/diagonal band complex appears to be a crucial structure for the normal functioning of the hippocampal formation (HF') (Olton, 1990) . The septal nuclei which, contrary to the prevailing opinion, are well developed in human brain (Andy and Stephan, 1968) are poorly individualized cell groups whereas the vertical limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band, the other com- ponent of this basal forebrain complex, is an aggregation of rather large cells. Electrical stimulation of the medial septum in rats produced significant in- creases in bilateral hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) whereas other brain regions were not influenced. The responses of increased rCBF were confirmed for the regions that receive cholinergic nerve projections from the medial septum indicating that the responses may be related to activation of the cholinergic fibres (Adachi et al. , 1990) . The septal region is a principal site for Acetylcholine-Dopamine (ACh-DA) interaction. In septal nuclei DA ligands have been found to affect the activity of hippocampal cholinergic projections arising from the medial septal/diagon- al band complex (Robinson et al. , 1979; Swanson, 1982) . Particularly this ACh- DA interaction may be necessary for the maintenance of accurate cognitive per- formance (Levin et al. , 1990) . Damage to the medial septal area in rodents produced severe deficits in var- ious tasks testing spatial working memory electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the medial septum using the (14C) iodoantipyrine method in rats.

SCHURI (From the Department of Neuropsychology, Max-Planck-Institute for Psychiatry, Munich, FRG) SUMMARY Damage to diencephalic structures is stated to give rise to memory dysfunction. Amnesia is likely to occur following vascular lesions in the ventral portion of the thalamus. The CT findings of 6 of our own cases and 5 patients reported in the literature, all with selective vascular lesions of the thalamus, were studied to determine the critical structures involved in human memory processes more closely. Thalamic amnesia probably depends on intrathalamic white matter lesions more than on nuclear lesions. The mamillothalamic tract and the ventral portion of the lamina medullaris interna are the most likely candidates in the mediation of memory processes and a combined lesion of these structures may be responsible for thalamic amnesia in man. Two patients without significant memory dysfunction had lesions in the ventrobasal portion of the mediodorsal nucleus sparing the mamillothalamic tract and the ventral part of the lamina medullaris interna. Our findings correspond well with the understanding of amnesia as a disconnection syndrome stressed recently by Warrington and Weiskrantz (1982) and with Mishkin s (1982) model of the memory system in monkeys. INTRODUCTION There is an increasing body of evidence that damage to diencephalic structures causes memory dysfunction (for review see Winocur et al. , 1984) , but it has been difficult so far to identify the relevant structures. Among various aetiological processes affecting the diencephalon, thalamic infarction may represent one of the most appropriate clinical models for a closer determination of these critical regions. Over the last few years several cases of thalamic vascular lesions have been reported where on the basis of CT scans hypodense lesions in the ventral region of the thalamus have been held responsible for memory dysfunction (von Cramon and Eilert, 1979; Schott et al. , 1980; Speedie and Heilman, 1982, 1983; Goldenberg et al. , 1983; Winocur et al. , 1984) . However, despite advances in the evaluation of CT scans, reliable localization of small thalamic lesions remains difficult. It is the aim of the present paper to further the discussion on the anatomical basis of diencephalic amnesia by considering the knowledge of vascularization and angioarchitecture of Address for correspondence: Dr D.

HEBEL AND U. SCHURI the human thalamus (Bittner, 1960; Plets et al. , 1970) . In addition to examining the extent to which thalamic nuclei may be involved, whether lesions of thalamic white matter may play a role in diencephalic amnesia will be discussed. Vascularization and Angioarchitecture of the Thalamus The polar and paramedian thalamic vessels. Thalamic vascularization is complex; it is thus not surprising that there are divergent classifications reported in the literature (Foix and Hillemand, 1925; Westberg, 1966; Plets et the MTT (Percheron, 1976a) . The paramedian thalamic arteries arise from the basilar communicating artery. Numerous variants concerning their origin and proximal course have been described (Percheron, 1966; Plets et al. , 1970) . Frequently the paramedian thalamic arteries of both sides emerge from a common trunk; in this case bilateral lesions may occur from a single vascular occlusion. Branches of the paramedian thalamic vessels penetrate the medioventral surface of the thalamus and diverge from there to the laterodorsal part of the lateral nuclear region. This oblique course determines a typical infarct pattern traversing the thalamus from mediobasal to laterodorsal. The territory of the paramedian thalamic arteries includes (1) the posterior part of the IML; (2) part of the mediodorsal nucleus; (3) the inferior paraventricular region; (4) the internal ventro-oral nucleus; (5) the parafascicular nucleus; (6) the ventral pole of the central nucleus; (7) the tract of Meynert; and (8) in the absence of a polar thalamic artery, the territory of this vessel. hoz 6 Azeniqe4 uo jsen6 Aq Woy pepeojumog THALAMIC AMNESIA 995 The mesencephalic branches originate separately or from a common trunk with the paramedian thalamic arteries. Thus lesions in the paramedian thalamic territory are frequently associated with mesencephalic lesions. The paramedian mesen- cephalic arteries supply the interpeduncular nucleus, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, the medial part of the red nucleus, and the anterior part of the periaqueductal grey. It should be added here that the anterior nucleus receives blood from branches of the choroidal vessels (Percheron, 1976a) . There are few vessels in the polar thalamic region of arteriolar size; they run parallel to the stem artery in the ventrothalamic white matter. Most of the vessels are precapillaries and capillaries, which emerge at right angles from the main trunks and form a ventrodorsal orientated network. In the same way the end branches of the paramedian thalamic arteries show a parallel course. All arterioles of these vessels run in a uniform direction from medioventral to laterodorsal. The central group follows the fibre tracts of the IML giving off side branches of precapillary and capillary size to the adjacent nuclei. The grey matter of the ventral thalamus is characterized by the regular pattern of the capillary network with rectangular meshes. On the other hand ventrothalamic white matter, namely the MTT and IML, shows a concentration of large vessels with a parallel course. The territory of polar as well as paramedian thalamic arteries within the thalamus is depicted in fig. 2a, B (dark grey area) . S102 6 Arenuqe4 uo ysen6 Aq wWo4y papeojumog, 996 D. Y. VON CRAMON, N. HEBEL AND U. SCHURI MATERIAL AND METHODS Personal Material The study is based on 6 of our own cases with selective hypodense lesions in the ventral region of the thalamus, 4 of whom suffered from chronic amnesia, whereas two patients (Cases 5 and 6) showed no obvious memory dysfunctions. The main clinical data are shown in Table 1. Careful neurological and neuropsychological examination revealed no additional deficit in the patients with chronic amnesia. On the other hand, the patients without memory dysfunction showed some persistent neurological deficits (see Table 1) . Magnification angiography of the opacified diencephalic vessels showed no abnormal findings. CSF studied in Cases !, 3 and 5 was normal. TABLE |.

Besides the memory performance self-reports of memory (subjective memory) were also evaluated using a German version of the SMQ (Bennett-Levy and Powell, 1980) . Amnesic patients with bilateral lesions tended to underestimate their memory problems. This had not been the case in the patient with the left- sided thalamic lesion. General intelligence as tested with the German short version of the WAIS (Dahl, 1972) was normal in all patients. Whereas simple visual and acoustic reaction times were normal in all patients, Cases 1, 3 and 5 were impaired in visual choice reaction times. CT scans of our cases were performed ona General Electric Scanner CT 9800. Five millimetre slices were obtained parallel to the fronto-occipital (FO) line according to Tokunaga et al. (1977) . This reference line is defined by the frontal and occipital pole of the longer hemisphere, which in most cases is the left and can be determined in the scout view. Within narrow limits the FO line is parallel to the AC-PC line (Tokunaga et a/. , 1977) which is the reference tine for the horizontal sections in the Van Buren and Borke (1972) atlas. Stereotactic data which refer to the AC-PC line show a well-defined relation between diencephalic structures. Thus, proper localization of the CT lesions in the horizontal slices was attempted using identifiable landmarks such as the foramina of Monro, genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule, distal fornix and transverse fissure. The MTT was expected to lie on or adjacent to a frontal line through the narrowest interthalamic distance (within the ventral half of the third ventricle) . The craniocaudal extension of the hypodense lesion within the ventral part of the dorsal thalamus was assessed with the help of sagittal reconstructions of the horizontal CT slices. hoz 6 Azeniqe4 uo jsen6 Aq Woy pepeojumog THALAMIC AMNESIA 997 TABLE 2.

These are the cases of Schott et al. (1980) , Barbizet et al. (1981) , Michel ef a/. (1982) with bilateral lesions, as well as those of Speedie and Heilman (1982) and Goldenberg et al. (1983) with left-sided thalamic lesions. The craniocaudal position of the thalamic lesions of these cases was roughly estimated relying on the depicted figures. The thalamic lesions of all 11 patients (6 with bilateral, 5 with left-sided lesions) were transformed onto two horizontal sections from the Van Buren and Borke (1972) atlas. As the upper third of the thalamus was spared in all cases, only sections through the lower and middle thalamic level (2. 7 mm and 9. 7 mm above the AC-PC line) were used. Further, 17 patients with paramedian thalamic infarctions (infarctions in the territory of the polar arteries were excluded) from the paper of Castaigne et al. (1981) were transferred onto the horizontal section through the lower thalamus. The dark grey area represents the 75 per cent overlap area of the territory of the paramedian thalamic arteries, which does not extend to the horizontal section 9. 7 mm above the AC-PC line. RESULTS CT scanning of our patients revealed selective hypodense areas in the ventral part of the thalamus. The patterns of these low-density areas reflect the involvement of S10z 6 Azeniqa4 uo ysen6 Aq Woy pepeojumog D. Y. VON CRAMON, N. HEBEL AND U. SCHURI 998 Downloaded from by guest on February 9, 2015 THALAMIC AMNESIA 999 the paramedian thalamic and/or polar arteries. The CT scans were carried out in the chronic stage of stroke evolution (more than two months after onset) in which the hypodensities showed well defined outlines and density values of CSF. Beside the hypodense areas in the thalamus no further abnormalities could be seen in the scans. In fig. 1, the original CT scans of 3 patients are shown. Two patients revealed bilateral lesions, 1 with chronic amnesia (Case 2) , 1 without memory dysfunction (Case 5) ; the third patient (Case 4) had a left-sided thalamic lesion. Fig. 2A shows the overlap areas for all amnesic patients with the exception of the cases of Barbizet et al. (1981) , and of Speedie and Heilman (1982) , where CT scans through the lower thalamic level were not presented in their paper (white areas delineated by broken lines) . There is no essential difference between the two sides, even though the overlap area for left thalamic damage relies on 7 patients (5 bilateral and 2 left-sided) whereas for right-sided damage it is based on the 5 bilateral cases only. The overlap area at the lower thalamic level is rather small, including mainly the MTT and the ventral portion of IML. The medial border of the overlap areas reaches to the lateral walls of the third ventricle. It is noteworthy that only the outermost ventrobasal portion of the mediodorsal nucleus lies within the overlap areas. Of all surrounding thalamic nuclei except the internal ventro-oral nucleus only minor parts are involved. , At the middle thalamic level (fig. 2B) areas of overlap are located more laterally, their centre lying in the internal ventro-oral nucleus. Again the ventral portion of IML and a small ventrolateral portion of the mediodorsal nucleus are involved. In fig. 34 the line diagrams of 5 patients with an amnesic syndrome are shown. On the lower thalamic level the lesion area occupies the polar part of the thalamus including the ventrobasal part of the mediodorsal nucleus. On the other hand lesions of 2 cases (Case 2 of our series and the patient of Schott et al. , 1980) are located more posteriorly at this level, extending into the ventral part of the central nuclei (fig. 3B) . At the middle level all cases occupy the polar area. In fig. 4a the lower thalamic lesions of 2 of our own cases without significant memory dysfunction (Cases 5 and 6) are depicted (broken lines) . One patient (Case 5) had a bilateral lesion involving mainly the mediodorsal nucleus. In Case 6, the left mediodorsal nucleus is affected. The lesion areas of these 2 patients correspond very well with the 75 per cent overlap area of the paramedian thalamic infarctions reported in the paper of Castaigne ef al. (1981) . Fic. la-c. Original CT scans of Cases 2, 4 and 5. The most caudal sections are shown on the left. a, in this amnesic patient (Case 2) , bithalamic low-density areas can be seen. In all sections they are almost symmetrically situated in the polar region of the thalamus. In the more cranial sections the hypodense area appears to be separated from the third ventricle by a small normodense bend. This pattern can be considered typical of an infarction in the territory of the polar thalamic artery which preserves the anterior nuclei. p, the CT scans of a patient without obvious memory deficit are shown. In the caudal section the bilateral hypodensities are located posterior to the commissural nuclei (narrowest interthalamic distance) . In the middle section the hypodense areas are located more laterally, excluding the polar region of the thalamus. c, the CT scans of an amnesic patient (Case 4) demonstrate a left-sided hypodense area involving nearly the entire polar region of the thalamus. S102 6 Arenuqe4 uo ysen6 Aq wWo4y papeojumog, 1000 D. Y . VON CRAMON, N. HEBEL AND U. SCHURI THALAMIC AMNESIA 1001 At the middle thalamic level (fig. 48) the lesions of these 2 patients involve parts of the IML. Case 5 shows a marked lesion of the right mediodorsal nucleus and of the left internal ventro-oral nucleus. The lesion in Case 6 affects mainly the left mediodorsal nucleus. . DISCUSSION The memory and learning assessment in our own cases demonstrated that Cases 1 to 4 obviously suffered from chronic amnesia. At the time of their examination (between 12 and 84 months after onset) no additional neuropsychological deficit could be detected in the amnesic patients except for a slowing of information processing in 2 (Cases 1 and 3) . On the other hand, the 2 patients without obvious memory dysfunction showed some persistent neurological deficits of the type to be expected from paramedian thalamic infarctions. The good performance of Cases 2 and 3 (bilateral lesions) , both of whom were amnesic, in recognizing faces after an interval of 48 hours, is perhaps unexpected. This result may be related to the difficulty of the recognition task that was administered. It is noteworthy that Case 3, whose bilateral thalamic lesions had occurred 84 months before, showed better performance in a nonverbal learning task (object paired-associate learning) than Case 5, who sustained a left-sided thalamic lesion, sparing the right thalamus, 26 months before. It may be assumed that with cerebral lesions of this duration, there may be better compensation in nonverbal than in verbal learning tasks. Considering the fact that the patient with the left-sided thalamic lesion performed poorly in the object paired-associate learning task and also in the visually guided stylus maze task, two explanations are possible, first that there is no clear-cut left-right specialization in thalamic function or, the more probable alternative, that these nonverbal learning tasks also involve verbal strategies. Free recall of a 57-unit story was surprisingly unimpaired in Case 4 witha unilateral lesion in the left dominant thalamus. With respect to the severity of the learning deficits, there are no significant differences between the bilateral and the left-sided thalamic lesions according to the criteria that we employed. As the story used had a high imagability it may be assumed that nonverbal cues helped to improve the recall of verbal information. Fic. 2a, B.

SCHURI In a majority of cases diencephalic amnesia due to vascular lesions is caused by an infarction in the polar region of the thalamus, which is supplied by the polar artery in about 60 per cent of subjects. Two amnesic patients show more posteriorly located infarctions extending into the ventral portion of the central nuclei. We assume that in these cases amnesia is caused by infarction within the territory of the paramedian arteries. We would speculate that this second type of thalamic amnesia occurs when the paramedian thalamic arteries irrigate the polar region of the thalamus in the absence ofa significant polar artery. It seems likely that pure paramedian thalamic infarction, that is, when there is an artery sufficient to supply the polar region of the thalamus, causes no severe memory disorder. This assumption is supported by the 2 patients without memory dysfunction, whose infarct patterns are limited to the central paramedian territory (see also the cases of Castaigne et al. , 1981) . However, in these infarctions memory dysfunction cannot be excluded completely as the impaired performance of Case 5 in visual maze learning indicates. The failure in this test may also be due to the vertical gaze paresis and/or to slowed information processing. Affected Structures in Vascular Thalamic Amnesia The anterior nuclei are not likely to be involved in thalamic infarctions causing amnesia. Neither polar nor paramedian arteries participate in the blood supply of these nuclei. As there was no evidence of involvement of the choroidal vessels the anterior nuclei can be considered to be preserved. With regard to the mediodorsal nucleus, Victor et al. (1971) suggested that lesions of this nucleus were critical for permanent memory decrement. The case of patient N. A. (Squire and Moore, 1979) supports the concept of a critical role of the mediodorsal nucleus in memory processes. Speedie and Heilman (1982) claimed that they could provide further evidence for this assumption although it is doubtful whether significant parts of the left mediodorsal nucleus are affected in their case (see fig. 2 of their paper) . Examination of our polar thalamic infarctions leads us to conclude that only a minor ventrobasal portion of the mediodorsal nucleus is involved, the major part of the nucleus being spared. On the other hand, the 2 patients with pure paramedian thalamic infarctions showed no amnesia although comparatively large parts of the mediodorsal nucleus were involved. Reference to fig. 2 shows that the internal ventro-oral nucleus remains a possible candidate in the mediation of memory processes. There is, however, no evidence so far that this nucleus, which is connected bidirectionally with the premotor cortex, is involved in memory function. The overlap areas in fig. 2 encircle two fibre structures, the MTT and the ventral part of the IML. The MTT is a component of the Papez circuit connecting the mamillary body with the anterior thalamic nucleus. There is a vast body of evidence that a bilateral disruption of the Papez circuit may cause memory decrement (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Horel, 1978; Mair et al. , 1979) . Most authors agree that in thalamic amnesia the MTT is involved. In a recent study Winocur et al. (1984) S10z 6 Azeniqa4 uo ysen6 Aq Woy pepeojumog THALAMIC AMNESIA 1005 showed a lesion of an amnesic patient where the MTT lay just anterior to the lesion. The authors conceded, however, that this fibre bundle may have been affected. Angioarchitectonic considerations (see p. 995) make it extremely unlikely that the MTT will be preserved in vascular infarctions due to the polar artery or the polar branches of the paramedian arteries. The involvement of the MTT in vascular thalamic lesions is confirmed by pathoanatomical findings. Two amnesic patients (Cases 2 and 7) from the paper of Castaigne et al. (1981) showed a thalamic softening interrupting the MTT on the left in both cases and in Case 7 also on the right. Delay et al. (1961) reported 2 cases of vascular thalamic dementia , one of them suffering from marked memory disturbance while the other had no obvious memory dysfunction; in both cases nearly identical lesions were found with the exception of the left MTT which was affected in the amnesic patient and spared in the other. The possible role of the ventral portion of the [ML in memory processes has not so far been discussed. As the overlap areas show, this thalamic white matter structure will be damaged at both the lower and the middle thalamic level. Fibres travelling within the anterior and the inferior thalamic peduncles reach the mediodorsal nucleus by passing through this part of the IML (see Nieuwenhuys et al. , 1978) . For an infarction in the territory of the polar artery we incline to the view that the MTT as well as the ventral portion of the IML are commonly supplied by this vessel (Plets et al. , 1970) . The anterior thalamic peduncle contains bidirectional fibres connecting the prefrontal, orbitofrontal and anterior cingular cortex with the mediodorsal! nucleus. Through the inferior thalamic peduncle fibres from the orbitofrontal, insular and temporal cortex as well as fibres from the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei were ablated bilaterally (Aggleton and Mishkin, 1981; Mishkin and Aggleton, 1981) . These nuclei are the thalamic projection sites of hippocampus and amygdala. Our own data based on CT evidence, supported by some pathoanatomical findings, suggest that the interruption of the Papez circuit in the MTT, combined with the disruption of amygdalothalamic projections travelling through the ventral part of the IML, may be responsible for thalamic amnesia, much as might be predicted from the observations of Mishkin (1982) . Thus chronic amnesia in vascular thalamic lesions may be conceived as a disconnection syndrome in accordance with the assumptions of Warrington and Weiskrantz (1982) .

For the arterial supply of the ventral portion of the thalamus, the terminology of Percheron (1966, 1973, 1976a, b) will be followed; for the classification of the thalamic nuclei, see Van Buren and Borke (1972) . In a majority of cases the ventral thalamic region consists of two vascular subterritories, one supplied by paramedian thalamic arteries and a more anterior one irrigated by a single polar thalamic artery. The contribution of this polar artery to the supply of the thalamus amounts to 60 to 70 per cent (Percheron, 1976a) ; if this vessel is absent the polar territory is taken over by the paramedian thalamic arteries. The polar artery originates from the middle third of the posterior com- municating artery or, if this vessel is hypoplastic, from either of its ends (Percheron, 1966) . The territory of the polar artery includes (1) part of the reticular nucleus; (2) the lateropolar nucleus; (3) the paraventricular region and the massa intermedia; (4) part of the mamillothalamic tract (MTT) ; (5) the ventral part of the internal medullary lamina (IML) ; (6) part of the ventrolateral region; and (7) the ventral pole of the mediodorsal nucleus. In addition to the thalamus, the polar artery itself principally supplies the subthalamic nucleus. Most branches which emerge with the polar artery from the posterior communicating artery irrigate the hypothalamic nuclei as well as the columns of the fornix and the caudal part of of the lateral ventricle. Subependymal branches of the polar and paramedian arteries reach the anterior nucleus, but never penetrate this nucleus. Like all arteries penetrating the thalamus, polar and paramedian thalamic arteries are end arteries without mutual anastomoses of any functional importance (Plets e al. , 1970) . Most authors agree on the fact that neither the middle nor the anterior cerebral artery participate in the vascularization of the thalamus (Lazorthes, 1961; Kaplan and Ford, 1966; Plets et al. , 1970; Percheron, 1973) . Whether capsular branches of the middle cerebral artery irrigate the reticular nucleus and the lamina medullaris externa remains in dispute. The anterior choroidal artery participates to varying degrees in the vascularization of the lateral nuclear region (Plets er ai. , 1970) . The medial border of the supply area often lies within the lamina medullaris externa (Percheron, 1973) . The thalamic angioarchitecture (Bittner, 1960; Plets et a/. , 1970) has some specific characteristics, namely (1) a rectilinear course of arteries in the thalamus; (2) frequent rectangular ramification; (3) the parallel course of many large vessels in the thalamus; and (4) the preferential location of large vessels in the white matter of the thalamus. The main stem of a thalamic artery irrigating both white and grey matter always runs in the white matter and only smaller side branches penetrate into the grey matter. According to these criteria the polar and paramedian thalamic vessels show a typical distribution. In its intrathalamic course the polar artery follows the MTT amygdala reach the mediodorsal nucleus. Neuroanatomical experiments in the monkey have shown the presence of neural projections into the nucleus basalis of Meynert (substantia innominata) from the magnocellular portion of the mediodorsal nucleus. Through this projection this nucleus can potentially influence the cholinergic innervation of wide areas of the neocortex (Mesulam and Mufson, 1984) . There is no doubt that memory function depends heavily on proper cholinergic innervation of the neocortical association areas (Koella, 1982) . An extended lesion of the ventral portion of the IML disrupts the connection between the mediodorsal nucleus and major parts of its neocortical projection sites. In this context the anterior cingulate gyrus is considered to play a role in memory processing (see Whitty and Lewin, 1960; Laplane ef a/. , 1981) . In a more general sense frontal lesions should have caused memory dysfunction according to Kornhuber (1973) and more recently to Wallesch et a/. (1983) . It is unclear, however, whether frontal areas have a specific significance in human memory processes. Concerning the neural mechanisms of memory in monkeys, Mishkin (1982) assumed that the amygdala and the hippocampus may participate in it equally. Monkeys with either bilateral amygdala or hippocampal excisions revealed minor S10z 6 Azeniqa4 uo ysen6 Aq Woy pepeojumog 1006 D. Y. VON CRAMON, N. HEBEL AND U.

This case study docu- ments cognitive (in particular memory and executive) functioning in a man with a medial bi-thalamic infarct in the first year (8 and 12 months) post injury. NG showed persistent memory (including autobiographical) impairment, but improved executive functions at one year post injury. On a response inhibition task his speed of response improved but his ability to inhibit a prepotent automatic response declined, corresponding to an increase in behavioral disinhibition. Despite this, he showed ARTICLE HISTORY Received 10 November 2016 Accepted 15 February 2018 KEYWORDS Thalamus; bi-thalamic infract; social cognition; autobiographical memory intact performances on several social cognition tasks. This case contributes to our understanding of the role of the thalamus in mediating retrograde memory, executive, and social cognition functions. Introduction The thalamus is a complex structure made up of numerous nuclei that have rich interconnections throughout the human cortex, especially with the prefrontal cortex (Vertes, Linley, & Hoover, 2015) . Therefore, the cognitive consequences of tha- lamic damage are variable. Focal thalamic damage is rare and the current neuropsychological literature is limited to case studies and series, predominately of unilateral damage, with few studies of the effect of bilateral thalamic lesions. Thalamic damage can result in amnesia, including both anterograde (for new memories post-injury) and retrograde (pre-injury memories) memory impairment (Carlesimo, Lombardi, & Caltagirone, 2011) . Thalamic amnesia is most commonly caused by Korsakoff s Syndrome, due to thiamine deficiency from malnutrition associated with alcoholism, or thalamic infarcts (Carlesimo et al. , 2011; Kopelman, 2015) . In their comprehensive review of cases of vascular thalamic amnesia, Carlesimo et al. (2011) reported that 83% (69/83) of patients had an anterograde memory deficit, while a retro- grade memory deficit was reported in less than a third (15/46) of the patients in whom it was formally investigated by means of ad hoc tests (p. 782) . Autobiographical memory deficits (comprising episodic and semantic personal memories of when and where events occurred and the facts about this respectively) were reported in seven patients, one patient showed impaired memory for famous events and people, and the remaining seven had both types of retrograde mem- ory impairment. The temporal gradient of the memory impair- ment covered most of the life span of six patients, and was limited to 1-10 years preceding the onset of amnesia in four patients. Miller et al. (2001) have proposed that the right thalamus plays a critical role in retrograde memory function. In a series of 10 cases, Miller et al. (2011) documented impaired CONTACT Amee Baird amee. baird@mq. edu. au 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group retrograde memory in 100% (2/2) with right-sided mediodor- sal thalamic damage and only 43% with left-sided damage to the anterior or medial dorsal nucleus. The only patient with bi- thalamic damage showed the most pervasive retrograde amnesia. Nevertheless, the findings of the review of Carlesimo et al. (2011) do not support this as they found no laterality effect; retrograde memory impairment was present in 3/8 with a left thalamic lesion, 0/3 with a right thalamic lesion, and 10/23 with bi-thalamic lesions. Previous studies of the effects of focal bi-thalamic lesions have reported altered consciousness, hypersomnia, vertical gaze palsy, memory, and higher-level executive dysfunction. Van der Werf et al. (2003) examined executive and memory functions in the largest case series to date (n = 22 cases of thalamic infarction) . Regarding executive dysfunction (as assessed by Tower of London, word fluency, Wisconsin Card Sorting and Stroop tests) , this was associated with internal medullary lamina (IML) or mediodorsal nucleus lesions. Van der Werf and colleagues found that anterior and medial bi- thalamic lesions were more likely than posterior or lateral bi- thalamic lesions to cause memory deficits. Dense amnesia was associated with damage to the mammilothalamic tract (MTT) , and patients with intact MTTs showed preserved recognition ability. This is supported by the results of Carlesimo et al. (2011) review which concluded that infracts of the medial and anterior regions of the thalami is associated with antero- grade, and less consistently retrograde memory impairment, and involvement of the MTT plays a crucial role in the devel- opment of a dense amnesic syndrome. Thalamic infarcts are also associated with dysexecutive and behavioral deficits (Carlesimo et al. , 2011) . To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study has formally examined social cognition in a patient with a bi-thalamic lesion. loannidis et al. (2013) conducted a standard neuropsychologi- cal assessment in addition to two social cognition tasks (cartoon and sarcasm comprehension tests) in a patient with a bilateral dorsomedial thalami infarct at 3 and 5 years post injury. They found that impairments in memory and executive functions persisted over time, and that performance on the two social cognition tasks was impaired at 5 years post injury (not assessed at 3 years post injury) . The lack of any change in their results over time is not surprising given the late stage post injury of the first assessment. In this case study of a patient with a medial bi-thalamic infarct, our main objective was to characterize his memory and executive functions, in addition to exploring his social cogni- tive skills, in the first year post injury. Neuropsychological assessment using standardized memory (including autobio- graphical memory) and executive tasks was conducted at 8 and 12 months post injury, in addition to an exploration of several social cognition functions (including theory of mind and emotion recognition) at one year post injury. Method At the time of this study NG was a 44 year-old man with 17 years education, who had worked as a high school teacher (Industrial Arts) . He was married with two school-aged chil- dren. He had no medical history of note. His initial symptom was blurred vision and a Computed Tomography (CT) brain scan revealed a 3 ventricular mass (2. 6 x 2. 1cm, see Figure 1) . He underwent a right frontal craniotomy and resection of the tumor (transcallosal approach) , which on pathological review was found to be a B cell lymphoma. Post-surgery his level of consciousness remained low (Glasgow Coma Scale score 6/15) . Review CT brain scan showed no hemorrhage. He remained drowsy and confused with fluctuating consciousness. On the third day post-surgery he had a left upper limb focal seizure. CT brain scan review showed no acute changes. An MRI brain scan the following day revealed bilateral medial thalamic infarcts (see Figure 2) . Differential diagnoses of Artery of Percheron or deep vein thrombosis were raised, but it was Figure 1. MRI brain scan showing NG's 3\" Ventricular tumor. NEUROCASE @) 77 Figure 2. MRI brain scan showing NG s bilateral medial thalamic infarcts. noted that magnetic resonance venography appeared normal. Medical notes indicated that this was possibly attributable to a retraction injury. His postoperative course was also compli- cated by sepsis and multi-organ failure. The first neuropsychological assessment was conducted 8 months post-surgery and infarct, with the review assessment conducted 4 months later at 1 year post-injury. Standardized neuropsychological tests that tapped into a number of cognitive domains including intellectual, attention and memory functions were administered (see Table 1) . With regard to executive functions, in line with Stuss' (2011) widely accepted the theory of various executive functions that map onto different frontal regions, we chose a number of standar- dized executive tasks including those assessing verbal fluency/ generative ability, response control, concept formation and planning. The Autobiographical Memory _ Interview (Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1989) was also conducted. This is a measure of retrograde amnesia which assesses a person s recall of personal semantic facts and autobiographi- cal incidents from three life time periods, namely childhood, early adulthood and recent life. Results NG's cognitive scores are shown in Table 1. The initial assessment 8 months post-injury was limited by his severe hypersomnia, oculomotor difficulties (vertical gaze palsy) and hyper-distractibility due to hyperacousis and hypernos- mia. Additionally, he had hypophonia due to vocal chord palsy. He presented as childish, jocular and emotionally labile. He demonstrated some insight into his performance and commented I know I m broken and | don t know how to fix it.

The autobiographical memory interview: a new assessment of autobiographical and personal semantic memory in amnesic patients. Cut off scores of AMI: =borderline; *=probably abnormal; autobiographical memory (see Table 2) with relatively pre- served recognition. Speed and attention functions were also severely reduced and there was evidence of executive dys- function. In contrast, visuospatial perception skills were intact. Regarding psychosocial status, his wife reported that he did not initiate activities and that she prompted him to perform everyday activities such as eating, drinking and showering. He repeatedly stated how tired he was and that he wanted to sleep. She said that he was never emo- tional before, but now cried multiple times a day and that it was like having a third child. Neuropsychological review one year post-injury was prompted by his dramatic improvement. After the initial assessment, he commenced antidepressant treatment. There was no recurrence of his tumor and no further sei- zures. On review he was more alert and less distractible, and able to sustain his attention for approximately one hour. He was tangential in conversation, often reporting isolated autobiographical memories out of context. He complained of blurred visionaand remained childish and jocular. Improvement was documented in_ intellectual abilities, which was in keeping with average premorbid estimates, and speed and attention functions. Recall memory function tively preserved. There was evidence of executive dysfunc- tion with a decline in response control (as assessed by the Hayling Sentence Completion Test) . Of note, performance was errorless on selected items from a range of social cognition tasks (see Table 1) . His wife reported that he cried less often and for shorter durations, he initiated some activities (e. g. , teeth brushing, stacking dishwasher) and was engaging more often with their children, but in a childish manner. He was very anxious prior to his 3 monthly MRI brain scan review. His mood symptoms were reviewed at 17 months post- injury but no formal cognitive assessment was conducted. There was no tumor recurrence or further seizures. He con- tinued antiseizure and antidepressant medications. He was childish and disinhibited, and had a tendency to swear and made frequent references to poo. He had full-time carers and spent his time walking and swimming. He was not inter- ested in pursuing any further assessment or rehabilitation. Discussion This case study contributes several novel insights into the neu- ropsychological consequences of a bilateral medial thalamic lesion. It is the first to review cognition including autobiographi- cal memory in the first year post injury, and to document intact social cognition in a patient with this focal lesion type. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge our patient is the first to report hypernosmia and hyperacousis after bi-thalamic damage. These observations are consistent with the known connections between the thalamic medial geniculate nucleus and the auditory cortex (see Lee, 2015 for a review) and recent evidence of thalamic involvement in olfactory discrimination and attention (Courtiol & Wilson, 2015) . Our findings of persistent anterograde memory impairment in the context of relatively preserved recognition abilities are in keeping with previous studies (e. g. , Markowitsch, 1982; Van der Werf et al. , 2003; Van der Werf, Witter, Uijlings, & Jolles, 2000) . This case also contributes further evidence of the role of the thalamus in retrograde memory function (Miller et al. , 2001; Carlesimo et al. , 2011) , documenting a persistent autobiographical memory impairment (using the Autobiographical Memory Interview, Kopelman et al. , 1989) for one year post injury. NG had extensive with previous observations of six patients in the review of Carlesimo et al. (2011) and the single case of bi-thalamic damage in Miller, Monestario, Watson, and Harding (2011) . This is the first study to document intact social cognition after bi-thalamic damage. Only one previous study has examined social cognition in a patient with this lesion type using two tasks asses- sing emotion perception in cartoons and sarcasm comprehension (loannidis et al. , 2013) . They found impaired performance on both these tasks at 5 years post injury. We used alternative social cogni- tion tasks in our case study, and the inconsistent findings between our studies may be due to these task differences. It is widely accepted that social cognition is a complex construct and there 80 ( ) A. BAIRD AND G. A. ROBINSON is ongoing debate regarding what tasks comprise the gold stan- dard assessment of it. A limitation of this study is our use of only three tasks, although it is noteworthy that these tasks do canvass a range of social cognitive functions and have been shown to be sensitive in detecting deficits in a variety of neurological popula- tions (e. g. , McKeon et al. , 2016; van Harskamp, Rudge, & Cipolotti, 2005; Blair & Cipolotti, 2000) . NG showed errorless performance on selected items from a range of tasks assessing Theory of Mind, interpretation of social behavior and emotional attributions. Despite this, he was jocular and childish, and presented with increasingly disinhibited and socially inappropriate behavior over the course of time. Social disinhibition was the most prominent feature of his presentation at the final review. Correspondingly, he showed an interesting pattern of results on one executive task assessing verbal response inhibition, namely the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (Burgess & Shallice, 1996, 1997) . At the first assess- ment he performed poorly on the Initiation Section 1 (Initiation RTs) but within normal limits on Section 2 (Suppression RTs and Errors) . On review, he showed the opposite pattern of results, with adequate response speed on Section 1, but poor response control demonstrated on Section 2. NG's fast suppression errors are con- sistent with both quick, uncontrolled semantic output and impaired response inhibition, similar to a recently reported patient with inferior frontal damage in the context of a brain tumor (Robinson, Walker, Biggs, & Shallice, 2016) . Although dysexecutive and behavioral deficits are known to occur in association with thalamic amnesia (Carlesimo et al. , 2011) , further research is needed to investigate the role of the thalamus in specific executive and social cognition functions. In conclusion, this case study contributes to the scarce litera- ture on the impact of a focal bi-thalamic lesion on cognition, and our understanding of the role of the thalamus in mediating retrograde memory, executive, and social cognition functions. It also provides insights into the behavioral and psychosocial effects of bi-thalamic lesions in the first year post injury, which has clinical implications for the provision of neuropsychological rehabilitation to patients with this type of brain injury.

        "case_report": "110 Limbic encephalitis presenting with topographical disorientation and amnesia K Hirayama, Y Taguchi, M Sato, T Tsukamoto A case of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis presenting with topographical disorientation is reported. A 70 year old woman became unable to identify familiar buildings and landscapes and could not recall the way to destinations she had known very well for years. She also showed attentional disturbance and Severe anierograde) amnesia. Her extended for one year at most. No other neuropsychological deficits were noted. Thus her topographical disorientation was of the primary form. Specific tests related to topographical disorientation showed that her two main symptoms seem to fall into the categories of landscape agnosia and heading disorienta- tion. T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed high intensity signals in the anteromedial temporal lobes bilaterally, in the right posterior parahippocampal gyrus, in the right retrosplenial region, and in the right inferior precuneus. Anti-Hu antibody was found in the serum. This case shows that topographical disorientation can be a pri- mary symptom of limbic encephalitis. imbic encephalitis is a neurological paraneoplastic syn- | sin often associated with small cell lung cancer and associated with anti-neuronal antibodies (for example, anti-Hu) . Limbic encephalitis is characterised clinically by subacute cognitive dysfunction with severe memory impair- ment, seizures, and psychiatric features. ' However, there have been few reports describing the neuropsychological features of this syndrome, ** and no reports of topographical disorien- tation as a symptom. The typical lesion sites of the syndrome are the frontomedial aspects of both temporal lobes. We report here the case of a woman with limbic encephalitis case, who had not only amnesia but also topographical disorienta- tion, and whose lesions were found both in the anteromedial parts of the temporal lobes and also in the right posteromedial temporal lobe and the right medial parietal lobe. CASE REPORT A 70 year old right handed women, a caretaker and the owner of an apartment, with eighth grade education, was referred to us in February 1998. In January of that year, her family found that she had begun to lose her way even in familiar surround- ings, and had become forgetful of recent incidents. In Febru- ary, she was disoriented everywhere except in the immediate neighbourhood of her own home, and could not recall events that had occurred several minutes before. General physical and neurological examination was unre- markable. Neuropsychological examination showed that she had topographical disorientation and an amnesic syndrome, and her attention was easily distracted by irrelevant environ- mental incidents. T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed homogeneous high intensity signals in the hippocampi bilaterally, in the anterior portion of the parahip- pocampal gyri bilaterally, and in posterior portion of the right www. jnnp. com Figure 1 12 weighted magnetic resonance image showing homogeneous high intensity signals in the hippocampi bilaterally, in the anterior portion of parahippocampal gyri bilaterally, and in the posterior portion of right parchippocampal gyrus, the right retrosplenial region, and the right inferior precuneus. P 9 9 P parahippocampal gyrus, the right retrosplenial region, and the right inferior precuneus (fig 1) . An EEG was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid showed no abnormalities. On immuno- histochemical examination, anti-neuronal antibody was found in her serum, and western immunoblotting proved this to be anti-Hu antibody. On the basis of these findings she was diagnosed as having limbic encephalitis. Although we carried out extensive additional investigations, no neoplasm was detected in the lung or in any other organ. She died in 1998. Consent for necropsy was not given by her family. A detailed neuropsychological assessment was per- formed during her two week stay in our hospital, from 8 March to 21 March. Both our patient and 10 age matched healthy control subjects (all women; mean (SD) age, 68 (7. 0) years) gave their informed consent for their participation in a series of experimental investigations to determine the features of the amnesia and topographical disorientation in our patient. General neuropsychological assessment Her WAIS-R verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was 91 and her performance IQ was 78. The aphasia quotient of the Western aphasia battery was 98. 6 and its cortical quotient, 97. 7. Her score in Benton s right left orientation test was 20/20, and in the City University colour vision test, 10/10. Thus there was no evidence of dementia, aphasia, agraphia, alexia, object agnosia, apraxia, constructional disability, acalculia, hemispatial neglect, disturbance of right left orientation, or achromatopsia. yyBuAdoo Aq payed Areiqi] puenepy ye 1Z0z O 49q0}90 UO /WOd'fwuiq'duuly/: dyjYy Wo1y pepeojumog goog Aenuer | UO OL LL pZ'duul/geL LOL se peysiqnd ysuy : Auyelyoksy Hinsosnay jouneN Topographical disorientation in limbic encephalitis 11 SRRES | rayinget meme raleay New Figure 2 (A) An example of the photographs of previously unseen buildings shown to the patient to assess her ability to describe their appearances and viewpoints. Her description was: This is a square building with U-shape: windows. Its entrances are U-shaped too. A washtub-like porch hangs over the entrance. The edges of the front steps are cut off round. However, she had no idea from which viewpoints they were seen. (B-D) Results of the tests for topographical disorientation. A map of the patient's neighbourhood was drawn and some landmarks on it named (in italics) beforehand by her son. Circles show the actual locations of 11 buildings. Names, written in regular style, were added by us after the examinations. (B) The result of her identification of the buildings. The building which she could identify correctly is indicated by an empty circle, and those she could not identify by filled circles. (C) The result of her recall of locations. The buildings which she could locate correctly are indicated by empty circles, and those which she could not by filled circles. (D) The result of her recall of a route. The dotted square indicates the actual location of a clinic. Arrows show the route from her house to the clinic, drawn by her. The square with checkerboard pattern indicates her localisation of the clinic. Her description of the route was: Just outside of the gate of my house, the D river runs. Along the bank, walk 100 m to the left. Then turn left. After a 10 minutes walk, you can find the clinic to your right. Memory function She was aware of her memory disturbance, but was not seri- ously concerned about it. Her digit span was 6 and her spatial span 5. Thus her verbal and spatial immediate memory was intact. Her verbal memory score assessed by a paired associate task was 3. 0/10. In Benton visual retention test (form C, administration A) , her correct score was 4 and her error score 12. The result of these tests showed that she had severe anterograde amnesia. Her autobiographical memory for the events that had occurred up to December 1997 was excellent. For example, she could tell us detailed episodes during the last visit of her daughter on her way to Tokyo, some of which were confirmed by the daughter. The public event test developed by Fukatsu et al showed that her memory was preserved at above average rate, and the results extended up to 1996 were perfect (14/14) . However, her score deteriorated to 0/3 for 1997 to 1998. To evaluate her visual memory for famous persons, she was shown photographs of celebrities and asked to name them. Her performance in this test for each decade from 1959 onwards was within 1 SD of the controls, except for the last year of the last decade (1998) . She could not choose the right name for a person who became famous in that year. Thus her retrograde amnesia extended for two years at most. Specific tests related to topographical disorientation She was aware of her disability in finding her way to her des- tination. However, she was not aware of her impairment in recognising buildings or landscapes. Although she lost her way in our hospital as well, it was impossible to determine whether this impairment was caused by anterograde amnesia or by topographical disorientation. Therefore the evaluations were focused on her memory and her recognition of objects that had been familiar to her for years. Recognition and identification of buildings and landscapes She could remember the external appearances of buildings familiar to her. For example she could describe her own house accurately as follows: My house is a one story house of Japa- nese style, which has two roofs with brown tiles. The wall of the house is plastered white. There is no fence around the gar- den. The plants in the garden are pines and podocarpi. The distance from the street to the entrance is 3 m. There is a win- dow with wooden frames at the right side of the entrance. When shown photographs of previously unseen buildings, she was able to describe their appearance accurately (for example, fig 2A) . However, when shown 15 photographs of familiar buildings or landscapes, she was able to identify only one of them correctly, which was the building opposite her own house (fig 'B) . Four of the other buildings were famous and known to most residents of her city, and 10 of them were situated in her neighbourhood, including the apartments she was caretaker for and her own house. She had known all these 15 buildings for at least 10 years. Recall of the location of familiar buildings She could tell us the arrangements of the furniture in the rooms of her home. She could describe correctly the location www. jnnp. com yyBuAdoo Aq payejold \"Areigi] psensey ye 1Z0z OE 18q0}90 UO /Wodfwq'duuly: ; dyy Woy papeojumog Eoog Avenuer | UO OL LE pz duul/get Lo} se peysiqnd ysuy : AuyeiyoAsy Binsounan jounEN 112 of four neighbouring houses within sight of her home. When she was asked to mark their locations, she was able to do so correctly on a map (fig 2C) . However, she could locate none of seven neighbouring buildings that were not within sight of her home, either by description or by marking them, even the house stood just behind her backyard. Both her drawing (fig 2D) and her description of the route from her house to the clinic at which she had been treated for 15 years were haphaz- ard. These same 10 neighbouring buildings had been used in the recognition task described above. She could neither draw nor describe the plan of her house. Viewp: identification Her ability to identify the viewpoint from which an object was seen was assessed by presenting her with photographs of four objects. Each object was photographed from four different viewpoints. She was requested to identify the viewpoint from which each photo was taken. She was able to identify the viewpoints of all these objects correctly (16/16) . However, when photographs of her own house from three different views, or photographs of previously unseen buildings (as in fig 2A, for example) were presented, she had no idea from what viewpoint they were taken. DISCUSSION Topographical disorientation occurs when a person is unable to find the way in familiar surroundings. * Our patient could not identify familiar buildings and landscapes and could not recall the direction to destinations that she used to know very well. Other related deficits such as object agnosia, right left disorientation, hemispatial neglect were absent, however. Her accuracy in the famous face recognition test, which was devised to estimate non-verbal retrograde memory, showed absence of prosopagnosia. She had severe anterograde amne- sia with one year of retrograde amnesia at most. However, as the items she could not recognise or locate had been well known to her for years, it was impossible to attribute this impairment to her amnesia. Thus the topographical disorien- tation of this patient was of primary form. Aguirre and D Esposito classified topographical disorienta- tion into four types: landmark agnosia, egocentric disorienta- tion, heading disorientation, and anterograde disorientation. Landmark agnosics have a visual recognition deficit confined to salient environmental features. Our patient seems to fall into this category of topographical disorientation. Although the majority of affected people cannot remember the appear- ances of buildings, '* the individual reported by Pallis' was able to remember and describe them. Our patient was also able to recall their appearances accurately. As Pallis s case had pro- sopagnosia as well, this is the first case of a landmark agnosia without prosopagnosia who retained the memory for build- ings. The site of the lesion responsible for this symptom is supposed to be the posterior half of the right parahippocampal gyrus. '' Our patient s MRI showed an abnormal T2 high intensity signal area at that site. Patients with heading disorientation have no deficits in representing the relative location of objects with respect to their body. So when imagining that they are standing at one spot in a familiar area, they can recall the locations of buildings viewable from that point. However, their exocentric spatial representations are selectively damaged. They are unable to derive directional information from landmarks they are able to recognise if one of two locations is not visible from the imagined spot. \" This was true of our case. She was able to describe the location of the houses within sight of her home, but could not locate even the house that stood behind her backyard. Thus, except for the features caused by landmark agnosia or amnesia, her symptoms also seem to fall into the category of heading disorientation. Suzuki ef al found that their case could not identify the viewpoints of buildings while www. jnnp. com Hirayama, Taguchi, Sato, et al being able to identify the viewpoints of other objects. Thus they argued that heading disorientation was caused by this particular disability. The same symptom was present in our case. The lesion responsible for this symptom is supposed to be located in the posterior half of the right retrosplenial region. The MRI in our patient showed an abnormal T2 high intensity signal area at that site. There are no reports of cases of limbic encephalitis showing topographical disorientation as one of the neuropsychological symptoms. The posterior parahippocampal gyrus and the ret- rosplenial lesion are adjacent to the hippocampus and the anterior parahippocampal gyrus, destruction of which is known to cause the amnestic syndrome. Our case shows that extension of the lesions to these regions may cause topographical disorientation as one of the first symptoms of limbic encephalitis.

LAROCHELLE Schools of Medicine (Neurology) and Psychology, and Human Neurosciences Research Unit, University of Ottawa; Ottawa General Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada A longitudinal study of three patients with CT-scan documented paramedian thalamic infarctions (bilateral, primarily right, unilateral left) is reported and the neuropsychology of human paramedian thalamic infarction is reviewed. The neuropsychological deficits following these selected lesions, the nature of the clinical memory disorder, and the neuroanatomy of memory are discussed. The significance of cortical/subcortical relationship in explaining observed behavioral changes is emphasized. Brain damage with maximum involvement in the dor- somedial nuclei and mamillothalamic tracts appears to cause primarily a memory disorder and frontal-limbic behavioral changes, the severity and profile of deficits depending on lesion extent and location. Both anterograde and remote memory loss may be present. Asymmetry in memory at the level of the thalamus was observed, following the left-verbal, right-nonverbal dichotomy. 1988 Academic Press, Inc. Two distinct forms of human amnesia have been distinguished in the last 15 years (Huppert & Piercy, 1978, 1979; Lhermitte & Signoret, 1972; Mattis, Kovner, & Goldmeier, 1978; Signoret, 1983; Squire, 1980, 1981, 1982; Squire & Cohen, 1982; Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1983) : diencephalic and bitemporal amnesia. Diencephalic amnesia is typified by Korsakoff patients (Victor, Adams, & Collins, 1971) and by cases of trauma or infarction such as NA (Squire & Moore, 1979; Teuber, Milner, & Vaughan, 1968) .

In addition to further characterizing diencephalic memory problems, other issues concerning neuropsychological changes after pathology in this region are relevant. If the lesion is unilateral, will asymmetrical memory deficits be confirmed (verbal-nonverbal) ? Are other functions disturbed: language, visual-spatial abilities, attention, etc. ? Do lesions in the diencephalic area result in a dementia and, if so, can this more general disorder be characterized according to common typologies such as cortical or subcortical dementia? Because of the intimate intercon- nections of the dorsomedial nucleus with the frontal lobes, are there parallels with frontal lobe disturbance? There remains a need for assessment of patients with well-defined focal diencephalic lesions to elucidate further the specific role of lesions 350 STUSS ET AL. in this region in producing specific behavioral abnormalities (Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983; Markowitsch, 1982, 1984; Zola-Morgan & Squire, 1985) . Computed tomographic scanning (CT) has allowed more precise localization of focal brain pathology and has led to progress in the delineation of brain behavior relations. We have studied three patients with isolated vascular infarcts in the paramedian thalamic areas: one with bilateral lesions, one with maximal right-sided involvement and one with only left-sided damage. These cases provided an opportunity to investigate the effects of specific subcortical lesions and to assess possible clinical differences arising from lesions of left versus right thalamic areas. We also studied specific characteristics of the memory process, including memory encoding and retrieval, and remote memory. Finally, repeated assessments yielded information on the prognosis of acute paramedian thalamic infarction. METHOD Subjects Table 1 outlines the demographic characteristics of the three patients. Details of cases 1 and 2 were originally presented previously (Guberman & Stuss, 1983) and are only summarized here. In the chronic state, all three patients were fully alert and cooperative for neuropsychological assessment. Case 1. This 54-year-old man (R. C. ) was in excellent health except for long-standing mild untreated hypertension until one morning he was found unarousable in bed. On admission, he was deeply stuporous but arousable with vigorous stimulation. The following day, the level of consciousness fluctuated. Vertical (especially saccadic) gaze was impaired. For 2 to 3 weeks he was disoriented, hypokinetic, apathetic, and hypersomnolent. CT (see Fig. 1) at that time showed small ill-defined hypodense areas in both medial thalami. He was eventually discharged home, where he remains apathetic and unconcerned, under the care of his wife. Case 2. This 51-yr-old gentleman (R. M. ) with mild untreated hypertension presented with coma, resolving into hypersomnolence, disorientation, inappropriate behavior, and both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Within 2 days, he was alert and oriented, but slow to respond, with an obvious memory deficit. He eventually returned to work. A CT scan (see Fig. 1) done 19 months after admission revealed a discrete low density lesion in the right paramedian thalamus. A coronal view suggested a barely discernible hypodense area in the left thalamus. Case 3. This 70-yr-old right-handed female (I. G. ) was in good health until] December 5, 1981. She had had one episode of vertigo a year previously for which she saw a neurologist. A CT scan at that time was normal. On the day of the present admission, she felt unwell. She was unable to follow a recipe to bake a cake. Later her husband noted that she had trouble finding words and was using inappropriate words. On admission to hospital, her blood pressure was 170/90, but later 130/60. Heart rate and rhythm were normal but she had an early systolic click. No bruits were heard in the neck. She appeared confused, said she was in a hospital in another city and gave the year initially as 1941 but later corrected herself. The neurological examination was otherwise normal. A CT scan completed 48 hr after the onset of symptoms revealed a low density lesion in the left thalamus adjacent to the genu of the internal capsule. Four days later, the lesion was not seen on a contrast enhanced study but reappeared on a subsequent scan and was still noted 1 year later (see Fig. 1) . The EEG was normal and cerebral angiography did 351 NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS syuow 6 / 19am 1-0 [edisursd jooyss pansy vd a OL d D1 ' syjuow LZ OL SS 9OM 7-0 J9ALIp YOnIL, JSAP YOnIL, u 1s Ww waz syjuow WURAIaS [LAID Ayissoatun PT SI 9 csyoOM C=O cysAyeue ssouisng Aypiqesiq, BIA | Ww PS W Dal soyep quowAo}dwa yuawAojdua uoreonpy ssoupopueyy aay xag quoneg quouissassy SNOIADIg Wasa SNOLLOUVIN] OINVIVH], NVIGIWVaYd HLIM SLNJILVg 3aYH] JO VIVQ OlhdvYooWaq: 1 aTavi STUSS ET AL. 352 NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 353 not show any occlusive disease. Both posterior cerebral arteries were noted to arise mainly from the posterior communicating arteries. Echocardiogram demonstrated no mitral valve prolapse. On discharge from hospital, she returned to her regular schedule. Neurological Investigations The neurological symptoms and investigations are summarized in Table 2. Part A (top) outlines the presenting and early states; Part B (bottom) summarizes the chronic stage. The CT scans (top) and the schematic localizations (bottom) are presented in Fig. 1. For each patient, the level best demonstrating the lesion was selected. For purposes of localization, a horizontal brain section from a CT scan atlas (DeArmond, Fusco, & Dewey, 1976, p. 28) was selected as the diagram most representative of all three scans. For patient 2 (R. M. ) , an additional coronal cut was used to approximate the left thalamic lesion. For each CT scan, two neurologists (A. G. , R. N. ) independently outlined the lesion on a schematic drawing. These two independent approximations were then overlapped (darker area) to yield the composite schematic localization on the bottom of Fig. 1, and indicate close agreement in localization. In Fig. 2, the level of the horizontal view and the thalamic area, in enlarged format without lesion demarcation, are presented to facilitate localization in Fig. 1. The schematic diagram based on analysis of the CT scans suggests the following localized maximum thalamic involvement. Involvement of other proximal areas, such as the internal medullary lamina and thalamic inflow and outflow pathways cannot be definitely ruled out due to the limitations of volumetric analyses of CT scan, especially for subcortical structures. 1. Dorsomedial nucleus: This nucleus is damaged in all three patients. In patient R. C. . there is maximum left DM involvement, and apparently only minimal right DM nucleus damage. In patient R. M. , the dorsomedial pathology appears more bilateral, with maximum involvement on the right. Patient I. G, has unilateral left damage. the DM involvement apparent only at the rostral tip of the nucleus. 2. Mamillothalamic tracts: In all three patients, the mamillothalamic tract, coursing between three thalamic regions (dorsomedial, ventral anterior, and ventral lateral) en route from the mamillary bodies to the thalamus appears to be involved, either bilaterally (R. C. ) . or unilaterally (R. M. on the right; I. G. on the left) . 3, Ventral anterior thalamic nucleus: The ventral anterior thalamic nucleus appears to be involved bilaterally in patient R. C. and unilaterally on the left for patient I. G. Patient R. M. has no evidence of ventral anterior involvement. 4. Ventral lateral thalamic nucleus: The involvement of this nucleus is variable. In all patients, there is some involvement. For example, in patient R. C. there is minimal bilateral involvement. In patient R. M. there is minimal suggestion of involvement of this nucleus. In patient 1. G. , there is evidence of some unilateral left ventral lateral involvement. 5. Centromedian, ventral posterolateral, and pulvinar have little if any evidence of pathology. There is a suggestion of minimal involvement of the centromedian nucleus in patients R. C. and R. M. Involvement of each of these brain areas, in each of the three patients, is schematically represented in Table 3, using a rating of 0 to 5 to provide an approximation of zero to maximum involvement.

The top half illustrates the actual CT scan results; the lower half depicts the location of the lesion according to a CT scan atlas. The procedure is described in the text. The left thalamic lesion in patient R. M. is a barely discernible hypodense area seen only on a coronal cut, suggesting that there is primarily tight paramedian thalamic involvement in this patient.

On the right, a schematic blowup of the paramedian thalamic area is illustrated, for more precise lesion localization of the areas depicted in Fig. 1. See Table 3. Neuropsychological Investigations Commonly used clinical tests are summarized in Table 4. Experimenter-devised procedures are described below. The latter were all administered after the patient had stabilized (after 6 months) . Learning of Spatial Mazes Following Milner (1964) , two simplified manual forms were devised (see Fig. 3) . For each, holes were drilled in a wooden board at equal intervals for either a 10 x 10 or 4 x 4 grid. The subject was told that there was one correct path leading from the bottom left to the top right. The subject had to learn the path by trial and error by placing pegs in the holes. Feedback was given for each response. If an error was made, all pegs were removed, and the patient restarted the test. Because of the patients difficulty (particularly R. C. ) in successfully completing the 10 x 10 grid, the 4 x 4 grid was used for comparison across all three patients. Thirteen trials were administered to each patient; the score was the number of correct pegs placed in each trial. The patients were compared to three normal control subjects of the same mean age and educational level. Memory Encoding and Retrieval Two different conditions were used. In the free encoding condition, a list of 12 words, 3 words from four different semantic categories, were presented at a rate of 1 every 2 sec TABLE 3 LOCALIZATION OF LESION IN THE THREE SuBsECTS ACCORDING TO BRAIN STRUCTURE R.

The patient was then told what the four categories were, and recall was again requested (category recall) . In condition two, the two types of recall were identical. Before the presentation of the list of 12 different words from four other semantic categories, however, the patient was informed what the four categories were (category encoding) . Comparisons were possible between type of recall within and across the two acquisition conditions. On this test, the three patients were compared to 12 normal subjects (age = 58. 9 (6. 9) ; education = 14. 3 years (2. 3) ) . Retrograde Amnesia One patient (R. C. ) was administered a series of measures of retrograde amnesia. All tests were devised, since no valid test existed for a French Canadian population. Twenty- two items constituted a measure of autobiographical remote memory covering work, school history, family history, and personal preferences. Knowledge of generic facts was assessed by the WAIS-R information subtest, and 10 additional questions (where does the sun rise? what is the color of snow?) . Ten questions addressed memory of singular facts (who sculpted the Pieta and painted the Sistene chapel?; who invented the airplane?) . Finally, 50 questions spanning five decades from 1930 to 1980 were presented, based on expected knowledge for an educated individual with a French-Canadian background. Spontaneous recall and multiple choice responses were requested.

RESULTS General Neuropsychological Tests Data gathered are described below, and summarized in Table 5. General Observations, Arousal, Attention Two (R. C. , R. M. ) of the three patients presented with coma, evolving into hypersomnolence and fluctuating levels of consciousness. Patient I. G. presented with confusion, evolving into an unconcerned state, with elements of denial. In the chronic (see Table 5 for definition) state, all three were alert, pleasant, and cooperative. R. M. had returned to work, with some lack of insight. I. G. was somewhat distractible, anxious, with a tendency to minimize any residual deficits. R. C. remained at home, apathetic, unaware, unconcerned, distractible, slow in response, with flat affect, good humor, occasionally aggressive outbursts, and little spon- taneous initiation. His wife, however, noted improvement in daily activities 3 years postonset. The patient took limited walks by himself and became involved in at least minimal social interaction. Attentional capabilities as measured by digit span (see Table 5) , remained relatively stable after the acute period. In the early stage, other clinical tests used to measure attention capabilities revealed a tendency for errors and slowness in response. All patients, particularly R. C. , continued to have extreme difficulty with the Trail Making Test, particularly in Part B, which requires alternating between numbers and letters (1-A-2- 6 0A z 9 9 g ia ueds -q ral 6 l 9 [rug rai L if) Ol 8 uy it s or 9 s duo $I ol 1 9 Opul tt or 68 8 OIA SIVA 220UdTTOIUI PeraUaH int Zz L 0 vonesques pion, 8/89 0b/6z 8I/ol 8/8 ov /0z 8i/s aLNd 01/ot 01/01 O1/L'6 01/ 6 OW/se uorsusyoiduo} Ol/ol 01/01 O1/or o1/ol O1/0I o1/8'8 uonnadoy Bissumeied eisoumeed eisouurered 3 dinpas *jdnpas *|dnpai < yeuON yEWION Qqeyuod pliy Aasiod *qejyuod agsiod geyuog aasiod qeyuoD Wws3}U0D i yndjno indjno Leal paseasout snoauejuods g fRULION [RWwi0N OA moy yBuULON] [BWIOU **]OA MOT] ou \"[oA MOT yoaedg e aSendue] a 91 S87 +A0E 00 AOE a off mS) wbPZ ss +00 v Supqew jes I abe 6 (V) . 2% (9S Let ral ST Al wll ALE 1-02 NO fewsap S v dad s L Ss .

B-3-. . . ) , Patient R. C. could never successfully complete this task. Despite continuing impairment, the overall results indicate an evolving improvement in the attentive abilities required by this task. Speech and Language Two of the three (R. C. , R. M. ) had diminished voice volume in the acute stages, which remained permanent for R. C. Neither had had laryngeal intubation. None revealed dysarthria or stuttering. Perseveration was common. Although all had language disturbance, it is uncertain whether they can be called aphasic. Repetition in the acute period was impaired only with longer phrases, and might be attributed to attentional or memory problems. There was no repetition deficit in the chronic stage. Compre- hension was impaired only for sequences or complex ideational questions. Naming was essentially perfect on the simpler Western Aphasia Battery subtest for all three patients. However, a naming deficit was identified by the Boston Naming Test. Patient R. M. s performance was primarily characterized by perceptual errors and educational deficiencies ( I don t know ) . In the chronic stage, a mild to moderate naming deficit remained, patient R. C. being more severely impaired. His performance significantly improved with phonetic cues. Except for R. M. , errors were not easily classifiable. Some were perseveration, others nonaphasic misnaming, and others paraphasias. Word list generation (number of words generated in 1 min beginning with a specific letter) was impaired for R. C. and R. M. in the chronic stage. The patient with unilateral left pathology did not reveal persistent impairment on this test. General Intelligence Although the cognitive assessment was not equivalent for all three patients, there was a consistent trend for impaired functioning soon after onset, with improvement over time. Patient R. M. , with a Grade 5 education, appeared to have premorbid limited intellectual abilities. Patient 1. G. , the retired school principal, had a definite improvement from low average to high average functioning. While overall verbal I. Q. abilities increased from 83 to 103 for patient R. C. , suggesting normal functioning in the chronic state, this likely does not reflect his premorbid abilities. This conclusion is based on the intertest scatter, superior score (13) on the test with the highest correlation with overall I. Q. (vocabulary) , and knowledge of his previous occupation. In summary, however, verbal cognitive abilities, even with bilateral paramedian infarct, recovered to at least normal levels. NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 361 Planning and Executive Abilities In the early stage, all three revealed confabulation and reduplicative paramnesia of place. Because of overall differences in /evel of functioning, examination of planning and executive abilities was completed at different levels for each patient. Patient. I. G. , at both the acute and chronic stages, despite her high I. Q. , had severely impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (only two sorting categories) , and the Porteus Maze (test age of 10/17) . R. C. and R. M. were administered the simple color- form sorting task, requiring one shift of concept: R. M. , despite his lower 1. Q. , completed the task successfully, while R. C. formed one concept, and continued to perseverate this. He was unable to shift. Visual Spatial Functions Visual -spatial functions were assessed by the Performance subtests of the WAIS (particularly Block Design) , related drawings from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) Parietal Lobe Battery (performed to command and copy) , and the copy of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) figures. Patient I. G. , with the unilateral left lesion, was only minimally deficient on simple drawings in the acute stage. While her WAIS performance I. Q. was 102 at this time, results were mildly beneath expected levels. This was confirmed by her above-average results once recovered. The other two patients, with documented right thalamic infarcts, had more severe deficits, never recovering to expected levels. Impairment was most striking in complex tasks and in the spontaneous reproduction of houses, cubes, etc. Copy of simple designs (WMS) was the least affected, suggesting that elementary visual-perceptual functions were reasonably intact in all three patients. Memory Functioning was impaired in all three patients, particularly in the acute stages. While recovery did occur, two facts were evident in the chronic stage. First, the patient with bilateral damage had persistent amnesia for both verbal and nonverbal material. Tactile memory was also severely impaired. Despite repeated assessments, he never remembered having seen the examiner before, or having undergone any tests. Even after 3 years, he was disoriented for time, indicating he could never learn the day, date, or year. Second, there appeared to be hemispheric asymmetry of memory functions in the two patients who had predominantly left or right unilateral pathology: R. M. , with the predominant right thalamic lesion, was relatively impaired with nonverbal material; 1. G. , with the left thalamic lesion, had pronounced difficulty with verbal information (see Fig. 4) . The results of the 4 x 4 maze learning test for the two separate testing sessions are illustrated in Fig. 5. Two observations are readily made. 362 STUSS ET AL. a BILATERAL (RC) STORIES PAIRED THREE VISUAL BvRT ASSOCIATES WORD REPRODUCTIONS. VERBAL NONVERBAL Fic. 4. Delayed recall on verbal and nonverbal measures of memory for all three patients with thalamic lesions (bilateral, primarily right, and unilateral left) during the chronic testing stage. Stories, paired associates, and visual reproductions are derived from the Wechsler Memory Scale. BVRT refers to the Benton Visual Retention Test, multiple choice format. For the three-word test, the patient is asked to recall three words after a 5-min delay. First, the two patients with unilateral (unilateral left; primarily right) lesions both eventually learned the task on the first session, with greater success on the second testing session. Patient R. C. , on the other hand, never learned the task. His performance deteriorated over time, his best results generally occurring on the earlier trials during both the first and second visits. Second, the learning (or forgetting ) curve for each patient frequently showed to a greater or lesser degree a scalloping effect, with good performance on one trial altering with poor performance on a subsequent trial. On the memory encoding test, all three patients were inferior to the normal control subjects under all conditions (see Fig. 6) . There was little evidence of consistent differences among the three patients in their ability to use category cues for either recall or encoding. All patients not only failed to benefit from category recall, but deteriorated in the number of words recalled. The two patients with more prominent left thalamic damage benefited at least slightly from category encoding, while the patient with primarily right thalamic infarction did not improve. Retrograde amnesia tests were completed only for subject R. C. , ap- proximately 3 years postonset. Knowledge of generic facts was 100%. Knowledge of singular facts was at the 50th percentile for the WAIS information subtest (scale score of 10; equivalent to I.

He was unable to indicate who painted the Sistine chapel (although he knew what it was) , who invented the airplane, or what kind of artist Rembrandt was. Twenty-two questions of autobiographical remote memory (verified by his wife) were 55% correct. There therefore appears to be a personal remote memory loss. A temporal gradient cannot be claimed, although descriptively the deficit appears more severe in the years proximal to the injury, with at least a patchy loss extending for many years prior. The results for the verbal retrograde amnesia test for both spontaneous recall and recognition are illustrated in Fig. 7. Spontaneously, R. C. could recall only such information as the Prime Minister of England (Thatcher) , the birth place of a Prime Minister of Quebec in the 1950s, Jesse Owens, and the name of the Dionne quintuplets.

However, there obviously remains a re- trograde amnesia in comparison to the recognition results for the normal control subjects. With the exception of the improved performance in the 1940s, R.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 365 DISCUSSION General Discussion Our results confirm that midline thalamic infarcts, especially when bilateral, cause a memory impairment. Our patients were ideal for study of clinico-anatomical correlations since they showed no clinical or CT evidence for brain lesions outside the thalamus. Whether the amnesia occurs as an isolated disorder or part of a more global dementia associated with thalamic pathology is open to question (Castaigne et al. , 1966, 1981; Chassagnon, Boucher, Tommasi, Bianchi, & Moene, 1969; Cheek & Taveras, 1966; Smyth & Stern, 1938; Stern, 1939) . Changes in higher mental functions other than amnesia were noted in our patients. A disorder in arousal and consciousness was prominent, particularly in the early stages. This observation has been reported previously in patients with thalamic lesions, with suggestions of disruption in subthalamic areas, ascending noradrenergic pathways, and/or the mesencephalic diencephalic junction associated with the reticular activating system (Castaigne et al. , 1981; Cox, 1937; Graff-Radford, Eslinger, Damasio, & Yamada, 1984; Graff-Radford, Damasio, Yamada, Eslinger, & Damasio, 1985; Magoun, 1958; Mills & Swanson, 1978; Teuber et al. , 1968; Von Cramon, Hebel, & Schuri, 1985) . In the chronic stage, this is frequently manifested as a lethargic, apathetic state, possibly with excessive sleepiness. Closely allied with the disorder in arousal is the reported attentional impairment (Archer, [linsky, Goldfader, & Smith, 1981; Schott et al. , 1980) . This may not be evident on simple tests such as digit span, or mental control tasks. Certain characteristics appear similar to the selective attention or executive control disorder of frontal lobe patients (Lezak, 1983; Luria, 1980, 1973; Stuss & Benson, 1984, 1986) . In the acute stage, all three had alterations in personality, mood, and awareness, including confabulation, reduplicative paramnesia, apathy, and unconcern. The personality change appears to be permanent only in patient R. C. Several years postonset, he remains unconcerned, unaware, jovial, and tacking any spontaneous drive or initiation. This apathy extends to activities of daily living. Other studies have reported similar findings in the acute or chronic stages (Graff-Radford et al. , 1984; Mills & Swanson, 1978; Swanson & Schmidley, 1985; Teuber et al. , 1968) . Many of the personality characteristics resemble those described after focal frontal or frontal-limbic system damage (Damasio, 1979; Eslinger & Damasio, 1985; Stuss & Benson, 1984, 1986) . The type of personality change after thalamic damage may be dependent on lesion location (Graff-Radford et al. , 1984) : anterior thalamic lesions, interrupting connections to the cingulate gyrus, could result in withdrawal and akinesia; DM lesions, affecting projections to the frontal (orbitofrontal) cortex, may cause euphoria and lack of insight. 366 STUSS ET AL. Visual perceptual and visual constructive disorders were found in all three patients in the early stages. The relatively intact abilities for our patient with unilateral left pathology in the chronic stage replicates previous reports (Speedie & Heilman, 1982; Squire & Moore, 1979; Teuber et al. , 1968) . In contrast, Graff-Radford et al. (1984) reported visual spatial impairment in 4/5 thalamic patients, including those with apparent unilateral left thalamic lesions. Only R. C. (bilateral) and R. M. (primarily right) revealed persistent problems, but only with more complex tasks such as block design. Whether the deficit was a premorbid limitation, as appears likely in part in the case of R. M. , a reflection of lack of initiation, an impairment in attention (Graff-Radford et al. , 1985; Henderson, Alexander, & Naeser, 1982) , or an organizational, conceptual deficit similar to those found in patients with focal frontal pathology (Luria, 1980, 1973; Stuss & Benson, 1986) cannot be readily determined. All three patients had a language disturbance that was difficult to characterize. The language functioning in our patients, typified by our patient with bilateral lesions, may be summarized as follows: poor initiation of speech with a general poverty of output that occasionally was con- taminated by confabulation and lack of monitoring of output; fluctuation and variability in performance; relatively intact repetition and compre- hension; and naming problems, apparently characterized more by per- ceptual errors, nonaphasic misnaming, intrusions, perseverations, and confabulation than by phonemic and semantic paraphasias. A deficit in word list generation has been considered a generic sign of aphasia, diffuse brain dysfunction (Benson, 1979) , and focal frontal system lesions (Milner, 1964) including frontal white matter, supplementary motor area, or cingulate gyrus pathology (Damasio & Van Hoesen, 1980; Freedman, Alexander, & Naeser, 1984; Kertesz, 1979; Sanides, 1970; Stuss & Benson, 1986) . In most of these cases, the deficit is one of initiation of speech rather than a true language impairment. It is noteworthy that the patient with the unilateral left thalamic lesion does not have significantly deficient verbal fluency. Although language deficits have been reported after focal thalamic lesions (Archer et al. , 1981; Bell, 1968; Barraquer-Bordas, Illa, Escartin, Ruscalleda, & Marti-Vilalta, 1981; Mohr, Watters, & Duncan, 1975; Walshe, Davis, & Fisher, 1977) , there appears to be lesion specificity, with more deficits reported after pulvinar, posterolateral, and ventrolateral thalamic nuclear damage (Brown, Riklin, & Waltz, 1971; Crosson, 1984; Davous et al. , 1984; Eidelberg & Galaburda, 1982; Graff-Radford & Damasio, 1984; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984, 1985; Ojemann, 1977; Ojemann, Fedio, & Van Buren, 1968; Van Buren & Burke, 1969; Vilkki & Laitinen, 1976) . In general, these are areas that have reciprocal involvement with a cortical language area (Crosson, 1984; Eidelberg & Galaburda, 1982; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984) . In other patients with thalamic lesions, the disturbances in NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 367 language (similar to our patients) have been ascribed to alterations in alerting or in a gate controlling access (Fedio & Van Buren, 1975; Mateer & Ojemann, 1983; Ojemann, 1977) ; a deficit in the integration and mon- itoring of language (Penfield & Roberts, 1959) ; impaired arousal and vigilance in a system closely allied with the dominant hemisphere language system (Luria, 1977) ; and interaction with other functions such as attention, concentration, and memory (Castaigne et al. , 1981; Choi, Sudarsky, Schachter, Biber, & Burke, 1983; Reynolds, Turner, Harris, Ojemann, & Davis, 1979; Speedie & Heilman, 1982) , at least in the early stages (Graff-Radford & Damasio, 1984; Graff-Radford et al. , 1984) . The language impairment in our patients may be attributed to multiple dysfunctions including alteration in alerting, arousal, and monitoring. While the diencephalic lesions temporarily disrupt performance on I. Q. tests (WAIS) , there is a recovery to average or premorbid levels (Mills & Swanson, 1978; Squire & Moore, 1979; Teuber et al. , 1968; Winocur, Oxbury, Roberts, Agnetti, & Davis, 1984) . In particular, verbal I. Q. skills are within the normal range in the chronic stage, even for the patient with bilateral DM damage. It is likely that this does not reflect this patient s premorbid abilities. It is uncertain if the deficits that are observed are primarily cognitive in nature or reflect indirect effects on behavior due to apathy or lack of organization. Lesion localization may also play a role, with greater cognitive impairment with damage in caudal and/or lateral areas (Graff-Radford et al. , 1985; Jurko & Andy, 1973; Wallesch, Kornhuber, Kunz, & Brunner, 1983) . It has been proposed that thalamic lesions may cause dementia (e. g. , Castaigne et al. , 1966; Chassagnon et al. , 1969) . In some cases small unilateral lesions result in general but not severe impairment of cognitive functions (Wallesch et al. , 1983) . Graff-Radford and colleagues (1984) proposed that patients with left but not right thalamic lesions meet the DSM criteria for dementia. Our unilateral patients had impairments other than memory, but these were not severe, and the disorder is con- sidered limited to memory. Considering as well their return to a relatively normal life, we conclude that unilateral focal diencephalic lesions do not result in dementia (Speedie & Heilman, 1982, 1983; Squire & Moore, 1979) . Patient R. C. meets the criteria for dementia, in that he has impaired functioning in several higher mental functions. Just as clearly, his dementia has characteristics unlike those described for patients with Alzheimer s disease (Cummings & Benson, 1983) . With the exception of the amnesia, the striking slowness in rate of information processing; the absence of apraxia, agnosia, or a true aphasia; the average I. Q. with impairment in using his acquired knowledge; the breakdown in organization of new or complex material; the striking inertia and apathy coupled with unconcern and a jovial attitude have all been described as characteristics of sub- 368 STUSS ET AL. cortical dementia (Albert, 1978; Albert, Feldman, & Willis, 1974; Benson, 1983; McHugh & Folstein, 1975) . Many of the symptoms described in our patient (s) are those reported after frontal and/or anterior limbic damage (Damasio, 1979; Poirier, Barbizet, Gaston, & Meyrignac, 1983; Stuss & Benson, 1986) . In this respect, the proposed terms fronto-sub- cortical, frontal system, or frontal-limbic syndrome appear more appropriate (Albert, 1978; Freedman & Albert, 1985) . The severe memory impairment, however, is unlike that described under the generic heading of subcortical dementia. The syndrome of paramedian thalamic infarct in our patients has its own symptom complex, characterized by a severe memory disorder and frontal-limbic behavioral changes. These deficits may occur with either unilateral or bilateral lesions depending on the size and location of the damage. Memory We have no ready explanation for the deterioration in performance on the memory encoding test when given category names. A lack of ac- cessibility to the stored information (Tulving & Madigan, 1970) does not seem feasible to explain the rapid loss of information that had already been recailed. Not only is the effectiveness of cueing related to the memory capacity of the subject tested (Tulving & Pearlstone, 1966) , but additional influences such as inability to maintain working memory in the face of interference may be a factor. Laterality Studies of patients with unilateral thalamic infarction have led to the proposal that hemispheric specialization extends to the thalamus (Squire & Moore, 1979; Teuber et al. , 1968) . In general, left unilateral lesions resulted in verbal memory problems, while right led to nonverbal memory deficits (Cappa & Vignolo, 1979; Choi et al. , 1983; Jurko & Andy, 1973; Michel, Laurent, Foyatier, Blanc, & Portafaix, 1982; Reynolds et al. , 1979; Speedie & Heilman, 1982, 1983; Squire, 1982; Squire & Moore, 1979; Squire & Slater, 1978; Vilkki, 1978) . In some cases, unilateral left thalamic dysfunction has been reported as causing verbal memory deficit or disorientation, with right-sided lesions showing little evidence of any deficit (Choi et al. , 1983; Graff-Radford et al. , 1985) . Others report that left-sided thalamic lesions appear to have a more devastating result, affecting both verbal and nonverbal memory and/or causing dementia, while unilateral right damage causes only a questionable nonverbal deficit (Alexander & LoVerme, 1980; Graff-Radford et al, 1984, 1985; Squire, 1982; Squire & Slater, 1978) . Finally, Wallesch et al. (1983) did not demonstrate a laterality effect for patients with Icng-standing unilateral thalamic lesions, suggesting that differences in the time of assessment was relevant. NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 369 Our results indicate right-left asymmetries at the level of the thalamus (see Fig. 4) . Testing completed | to 2 years following the acute event suggested a continuing asymmetry. Hemispheric differences were most apparent only with relatively simple tests; with increasing complexity, the deficit became more general. At a certain level of complexity, non- specific functions of the thalamus, such as alerting, vigilance, or directed attention (Brown, 1974; Luria, 1977; Riklan & Levita, 1969, 1970; Wallesch et al. , 1983) , may obscure hemispheric differences. Patient R. M. , with the predominant right thalamic involvement, did have difficulty on verbal tests such as the paired associates. His minimal left thalamic involvement may be a factor, as may be his lower intellectual abilities. The Neuroanatomy of Memory Anterograde vs. retrograde memory disorders in diencephalic amnesia. Separate roles have been proposed for bitemporal and diencephalic regions in memory functions (Huppert & Piercy, 1978; Squire, 1981) . In these claims, the bitemporal region has been suggested as being involved in faulty information storage, while diencephalic zones are hypothesized as being involved in the encoding operations, the acquisition of information. Most reports indicate good to normal memory for remote events after acute diencephalic dysfunction (as opposed to Korsakoff s disease in which a notable retrograde amnesia is demonstrated) (Michel et al. , 1982; Schott et al. , 1980; Von Cramon & Eilert, 1979; Winocur et al. , 1984) , with anterograde memory primarily or exclusively affected. The pre- dominance of anterograde over retrograde amnesia has been interpreted as lending support to the idea that diencephalic amnesia is mainly a learning deficit, a failure in the initial stages of information processing, rather than a retrieval deficit (Winocur et al. , 1984) . In contrast, two patients with lesions apparently limited to the dien- cephalic regions appear to have a severe and extensive remote memory loss in addition to the anterograde amnesia. Patient A. V. (Butters, 1984) , with a paramedian glioma, had a severe and extensive retrograde amnesia, with no temporal gradient; our patient R. C. has a pronounced remote memory loss, again with no apparent temporal gradient for historical facts, but a possible gradient for personal events. Our patient R. C. had isolated bilateral diencephalic damage secondary to infarction and dem- onstrated a moderately severe retrograde amnesia. Diencephalic pathology can cause both an impairment in acquisition as well as a remote memory deficit. Both of these paramedian thalamic patients (A. V. , R. C. ) appear similar in their memory functions to patient DRB (Damasio, Eslinger, Damasio, Van Hoesen, & Cornell, 1985) , who had herpes simplex encephalitis. Damasio and colleagues argued that a combination of basal forebrain, lateral temporal, and insular damage were necessary for major retrograde amnesia. Our findings suggest that, while 370 STUSS ET AL. focal limited DM damage may not cause severe retrograde amnesia, extension into very proximal corresponding regions or systems may result in severe remote memory loss in addition to anterograde amnesia. Our patient had bilateral mamillothalamic tract, dorsomedial nucleus, and anterior nucleus damage. Additional influences on memory functioning. To establish primacy of one brain region for memory, it is necessary to demonstrate amnesia with lesions limited to that area (Butters, 1984) . With this precondition, it is doubtful that human research will unequivocally unravel the role of different diencephalic areas in memory. In addition to limitations of in vivo analysis of structural pathology, the two diencephalic systems involved in memory are intimately linked. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, DM nucleus is immediately adjacent to the anterior nucleus and well as its connections with more anterior brain regions. Involvement of the DM nucleus may be responsible for the frontal lobe component observed in the behavior. Much of the prefrontal cortex is defined by projections from DM (Goldman, 1979; Nauta, 1971) . Many prefrontal signs can be replicated with focal DM pathology (Alexander & Fuster, 1973; Fuster & Alexander, 1973; Kolb, 1977; Schulman, 1964; Speedie & Heilman, 1982, 1983) . This concept would also be compatible with the suggested frontal lobe or frontal system dysfunction (among other problems) observed in Korsakoff patients (Butters, 1984; Moscovitch, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTS 371 1982; Oscar-Berman, 1980) . The ventral-anterior, and the surrounding reticular nuclei, also have important frontal and limbic connections (Akert, 1964; Goldman, 1979; Nauta, 1971) , possibly contributing to the arousal, mood, motivational, and attentional characteristics of behavior (Cummings & Benson, 1984; Scheibel, 1980; Scheibel & Scheibel, 1967) . The medial limbic circuit, including the mamillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, frontal connections, and linkage with the brain stem reticular core (Nauta, 1958) , is theoretically implicated in activating and feedback control mech- anisms (Livingston & Escobar, 1973) . Both the DM nucleus and MB appear to be involved in memory as well as other functions associated with the frontal-subcortical executive and arousal systems and limbic motivational/emotional activities. It may be hypothesized that impairment of these supplementary functions is sufficient to explain the memory deficit. Our results on the maze test (a scalloping effect, with an error occurring most often on the very first trial) suggested that motivational and/or attentional problems influenced the learning process. However, a true memory deficit, including left right asymmetry, was revealed on memory tasks that were relatively simple and/or on tasks that required immediate recall without additional attentional demands. Prognosis We have had the opportunity to follow our three patients for varying durations up to 3 years. Previous reports have been conflicting, with evidence of persistent deficits, full recovery, and partial recovery (Mills & Swanson, 1978; Schott et al. , 1980; Swanson & Schmidley, 1985) . In our cases there was a progressive and rapid improvement in the first 6 months, with some stabilization of performance between 6 and 12 months. Deficits demonstrated at this time appear to be relatively permanent (Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983; Castaigne et al. , 1981; Michel et al. , 1982; Zola-Morgan & Squire, 1985) . In the case of R. C. , the persistent impairment includes both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Summary Even small infarcts in the paramedian thalamic area can cause devastating neurobehavioral results. Although the primary deficit is in memory, these patients have serious problems with motivation, arousal, initiation, at- tention, and executive functions. The memory deficits reflect hemispheric specialization. Damage to the thalamus can cause persistent impairment in a number of higher mental functions. REFERENCES Aggleton, J. P. , & Mishkin, M. 1983.

Anatomical investigations have probed the role of damage to various brain areas in the two clinical types of amnesia. In bitemporal amnesia, lesions in both the amygdala and hippocampus appear necessary to produce an obvious memory deficit (Andersen, 1978; Andy, Jurko, & Hughes, 1975; Duyckaerts et al. , 1985; Halgren, 1981; Milner, 1966; Mishkin, 1978; Sarter & Markowitsch, 1985; Saunders, Murray, & Mishkin, 1984; Scoville & Milner, 1957; Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1983; Woods, Schoene, & Kneisley, 1982; Zola-Morgan, Squire, & Mishkin, 1982) . Controversy surrounds the role of various diencephalic regions in memory, in particular the dorsomedial (DM) nucleus and the mamillary bodies (MB) . Many publications emphasize the role of the MB or mamillothalamic tract (bundle of vicq d Azyr which runs from the MB to the anterior thalamic nuclei) , particularly in patients with Korsakoff s disease (e. g. , Brierly, 1977; Brion & Mikol, 1978; Brion, Mikol, & Plas, 1983; Castaigne et al. , 1966, 1981; Delay & Brion, 1954; Delay, Brion, & Elissalde, 1958, a, b; Gruner, 1956; Grunthal, 1939; Jarho, 1973; Mair, Warrington, & Weis- krantz, 1979; Pierrot-Deseilligny, Chain, & Lhermitte, 1982; Swanson & Schmidley, 1985) . The anterior thalamic nuclei themselves have also been implicated in memory functioning (Barbizet, Degos, Louarn, Nguyen, & Mas, 1981; Hassler, 1962; Mark, Barry, McLardy, & Ervin, 1970) . The DM nucleus, however, has been suggested most frequently as the diencephalic area most related to memory (Ignelzi & Squire, 1976; McEntee, Biber, Perl, & Benson, 1976; Mills & Swanson, 1978; Schott, Maugiere, Laurent, Serclerat, & Fischer, 1980; Smyth & Stern, 1938; Squire, 1980; Squire & Moore, 1979; Victor et al. , 1971; Williams & Pennybacker, 1954) . It has been proposed that lesions of the MB and DM nucleus may individually cause some amnesia but that damage to both are necessary for more profound deficits, the severity correlating with the degree of involvement (Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983; Riggs & Boles, 1944; Schott et al. , 1980; Speedie mamillothalamic tract, the outflow of the MB. Involvement of fibers of passage surrounding the lesion site must be considered (Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983) . In addition to physical proximity, they are usually fed by the same vascular system (Castaigne et al. , 1981) . Finally, Speedie & Heilman (1982, 1983) , based on Valenstein and Nauta (1959) and Meibach and Siegel (1977) , suggest that the DM receives input from the MB medial limbic system. While our quantitive structural analysis would appear to implicate the mamil- lothalamic tract to a greater extent (Von Cramon et al. , 1985) , it appears extremely difficult to selectively damage either the DM nucleus or the mamillothalamic tract output. of the MB. Moreover, we are unable to negate possible involvement of other adjoining regions such as the sub- thalamic zones. We propose that different brain regions in each of the two systems contribute to overall memory functioning in a specific way (Aggleton & Mishkin, 1983; Huppert & Piercy, 1979; Squire, 1981) . First, based on previous animal and human research, both the DM nucleus and MB systems (including the mamillothalamic tract and anterior nuclei) contribute to memory, the severity of the disorder depending on the amount of damage, with maximum impairment if both systems are implicated (Ag- gleton & Mishkin, 1983; Thomas & Gash, 1985; Zola-Morgan & Squire, 1985) . Second, in addition to the memory functions, each of these systems likely adds a unique contribution, based on its own role in behavior as thalamofrontal connections. In J. M. Warren, & K.

        "case_report": "Article abstract. Bilateral anterior paramedian thalamic infarction resulting from occlusion of a bilaterally distributed thalamosubthalamic paramedian artery was demonstrated on CT in two patients. Patient 1 presented with a transient coma followed by asterixis, hypersomnia, vertical gaze disturbances, profound Korsakoff amnesic syndrome, and a subcortical dementia. Patient 2, with a predominantly right-sided thalamic infarct, showed good recovery from amnesia and vertical gaze disturbances. However, patient 1 remained with severe amnesia and mild subcortical dementia at follow-up 1 year later. These and similar reported cases constitute a lacunar syndrome with characteristic clinical and CT features. NEUROLOGY (Cleveland) 1983; 33: 540-6 The syndrome of bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction Alan Guberman, MD, FRCP (C) , and Donald Stuss, PhD An acutely appearing persistent amnesic syndrome is usually attributable to alcoholism with thiamine deficiency, head trauma, cerebral anoxia, or bilateral medial hippocampal lesions. ' Bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction resulting from occlusion of a thalamosubthalamic perforating artery supplying both medial thalami? is a less-recognized cause of amnesia with abrupt onset. These cases have usually presented with transient coma, followed by an ap- athetic, hypersomnolent state that is accompanied by severe amnesia and vertical gaze abnormali- ties. 8-!2 The two cases reported here illustrate the clinical features and the role of CT in diagnosis. Detailed neuropsychological testing was done in one patient to delineate the nature and evolution of the behavioral features. Case reports. Patient 1. A 54-year-old right-handed university-educated business analyst was brought to the emergency room after being found unarousable in bed that morning. He had been well the previous evening, and his past health was excellent apart from long- standing mild untreated hypertension. On admission, pulse was 72 and regular, he was afe- brile, blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg, and there was Cheyne-Stokes respiration. General examination revealed only mild obesity. Although deeply stuporous, with vigorous stimulation he was able to follow a few verbal commands, and he moaned in response to pinprick. Pupils were 2 mm and reactive bilaterally; the eyes were in midposition, and horizontal oculocephalic movements were full (vertical not tested) . The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable. The following laboratory investigations were normal: CBC, routine blood chemistry, antinuclear antibody (ANA) , VDRL, triglycerides, cholesterol, folate, vitamin B12, T, , T, resin uptake, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) , 8: 00 AM and 4: 00 pM cortisol, alcohol level and drug screen, CSF pressure, protein, sugar, cells, and gamma globulin. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 46 mm per hour. Arterial blood gases: PO, , 58; PCO. , , 33; bicarbonate, 24; and O, saturation, 92%. ECG and echocardiogram were normal. An unenhanced CT on admission showed small ill-defined hypodense areas in both medial thalami. A four-vesse!l angiogram done later was normal. The next day, the level of consciousness fluctuated throughout the day. The Cheyne-Stokes respiration had disappeared. There was little facial expressiveness. As- terixis was noted in the arms. Pupils were 2 to 3 mm and reacted only slightly to light bilaterally. Horizontal eye movements were full, but vertical voluntary gaze and oculocephalic movements were completely absent. Bell s phenomenon was weakly present. Strong bilateral corneomandibular reflexes were present. EEG showed diffuse slowing in the theta and delta range, with a minimal amount of alpha during arousal. Occasional bursts of high-amplitude bifrontal delta were present. During the next 2 to 3 weeks, he remained disoriented, hypokinetic, and apathetic and tended to sleep up to 16 hours per day. Verbal and motor spontaneity were re- duced, he was incontinent of urine, and he had to be fed. CT 10 days after admission showed enhancement of both medial thalamic areas (figure 1, A) compatible with ischemic lesions. Three weeks after admission, a full reassessment was done. Neuropsychological findings. The patient tended to fall asleep as soon as external stimulation ceased, and when awake his attention would wander to distracting stimuli. There was virtually no insight into his condition. Emotional] responses were gen- erally impoverished and flat. There was a general slowness of mental activity, and response time varied according to task diffi- From the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa and Ottawa Generai Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Speech was of low volume and monotonous but fluent, with full syntactic structure. There was a great deal of perseveration and confabulation. Repetition problems occurred only with long phrases. Comprehension was intact except for the most difficult material, and he followed verbal commands well. Reading and writing were slow but well performed, and he was able to copy a complex sentence without error. When asked to sign his name, he signed his son s name. Color naming and identification were normal]. Object naming was well done for common items. More extended assessment (Boston Naming Test) re- vealed many errors of different types: descriptions, misperceptions, perseverations, don t know, oc- casional paraphasias, and delays. Word and cat- egory list generation were markedly reduced. There was no hemispatial inattention, extinction to double simultaneous stimulation, astereognosis, right-left disorientation, or apraxia. Recognition of faces was variable with some confabulation. When asked the place, he gave the city correctly but required repeated questioning and cueing to identify hospital center. He gave the year and month incorrectly. He was unable to successfully complete any of the items on any nonverbal subtest. Simple oral calculations were variable. Copies of various drawings, including the Rey-Osterreith figure, revealed extensive perseveration and over- drawing. Both anterograde and retrograde memory were severely impaired. Neuro-ophthalmologic findings. Horizontal sac- cadic and pursuit gaze were normal. Vertical gaze was limited to about 45 degrees in the upward direction and 15 degrees in the downward direction, and vertical saccades were virtually absent even when testing for optokinetic nystagmus. With fix- ation on a point, passive head movements elicited a full horizontal and upward gaze but only a very minimal downward excursion. Bell s phenomenon was present and full. Convergence was mildly im- paired. Irrigation of both ears simultaneously with 5 ec of ice water in the head-hanging position pro- duced some horizontal nystagmus to the right, after a delay of 1 minute, lasting 80 seconds. The pupils were equal, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, and irregular in outline and reacted briskly but incompletely to light and slightly so to accommodation. Subsequent course. Six weeks after admission, his remote memory had improved but was still severely impaired. He was unable to remember a number even for 15 seconds. After learning a sequence of three hand movements, he had no recall for the task after 2 minutes. There was a definite tendency toward confabulation. Calculation was intact. He was dis- oriented to place, city, and time and still denied his memory difficulty. Over the subsequent 4 months, he remained hypersomnolent and apathetic and continued to demonstrate a severe memory deficit. He was able to feed and dress himself and carry out simple tasks around the house but demonstrated little initiative or spontaneity. Occasional impulsive aggressive outbursts occurred, and he was often in- appropriate in his conversation and behavior. Vertical saccadic gaze remained impaired. Asterixis was no longer present. Formal neuropsychological testing results at 6 months and 3 weeks after his stroke are shown in table 1. Although abilities generally appear to be somewhat inferior to estimated pre- morbid levels, three areas memory, attention and monitoring, and visual-spatial abilities stand out as severely impaired. Results are unchanged on fol- low-up at 1 year. Other test results. CT on follow-up (8 weeks after admission) showed hypodense areas in both medial thalami (figure 1, B) . Visual, somatosensory, and auditory evoked potentials were normal. An 8- hour overnight sleep EEG done 2 weeks after ad- mission was essentially normal. Patient 2. A 51-year-old right-handed truck driver with a grade V education, known to have mild untreated hypertension, was brought to the emergency room after experiencing a 15-minute period of horizontal diplopia followed by unresponsiveness and urinary incontinence but no shaking movements. Upon awakening 3 hours later, he displayed hypersomnolence, inappropriate be- havior, disorientation, and anterograde and retrograde amnesia. When tested 2 days later, he was alert and oriented but slow to respond, and his facial expression was somewhat vacant. Only one of three objects could be recalled after 5 minutes. Saccadic eye movements were jerky and limited in the horizontal plane, and there was a moderate limitation of both upward and downward pursuit and saccadic gaze. Pupils were small and reacted to light. EEG revealed some diffuse slowing. More formal psychological testing was done 2 weeks after admission. At that time, there was no evidence of aphasia, although he was slow to comprehend complex material. Naming was accurate but hesitant, and there were some perceptual errors. Some perseveration was apparent in writing. No apraxia was seen. Calculations were done well for addition but poorly for more difficult material. Digit span was five forward and three back- ward. His ability to remember paired word associates was severely impaired. There were visual-spatial prob- May 1983 NEUROLOGY 33 541 Table 1.

Four months later, the patient was back to work, and his wife felt that he had returned to normal. Vertical gaze, especially saccades, was still mildly limited. Retesting was done 10 months after his initial pre- sentation. Ability to track consecutive numbers or alternate between consecutive numbers and letters was severely impaired, and color naming was impaired under conditions of interference. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) , he functioned within the mentally defective range on most subtests. Naming to visual confrontation was impaired, and word generation was severely limited. He was now able to recall three words after delays of 15 and 25 minutes. His recall of stories was in the low-normal range. Learning paired word associates and reproducing complex designs after a delay were impaired. The Benton visual retention score was 3/10. The Wechsler Memory Quotient was 84.

CT done 19 months after admission showed adiscrete low-density lesion in the right paramedian thal- amus and a barely discernible hypodense area in the cor- responding area of the left thalamus (figure 2, A and B) , Vertebral angiography showed some tortuosity of vessels but was otherwise normal. Discussion. Discrete vascular lesions and at times neoplasms involving the anterior paramedian thalamic regions bilaterally can cause an acute Korsakoff s syndrome (usually preceded by tran- sient coma) accompanied by hypersomnia, sub- cortical dementia, and vertical gaze disorders (table 2) . The paramedian thalamic areas are supplied by perforating branches (anterior thalamosub- thalamic paramedian arteries) that arise from the Figure 2. (A) Unenhanced CT done 19 months after admission in patient 2, showing right paramedian low-density area. (B) Same scan as in (A) , coronal views showing right and small left paramedian thalamic low-density lesions (infarcts) . posterior cerebral artery between the basilar bi- furcation and the origin of the posterior commu- nicating artery. ? Occasionally both paramedian thalamic regions are supplied from a common trunk on one side; this variation accounts for the si- multaneous appearance of bilateral infarctions in this vascular territory. Other anatomic variations (including a common origin of the thalamosub- thalamic paramedian artery and the superior para- median mesencephalic artery) ! account for dif- ferent clinical manifestations such as persistent akinetic mutism with a more posterior and caudally placed lesion. Our patient 1 showed many of the typical features seen in previously reported cases (table 2) . The onset was acute with deep stupor or coma, evolving in hours or days into a lethargic, apathetic state with hypersomnia. In our patient 2, and in the patient of Barbizet et al, there was transient diplopia at the onset, before consciousness was lost. CT lesions were uniform in location in the eight reported cases so studied (table 2) . Barbizet et al applied a stereotaxic CT method to localize the thalamic lesions that affected ventral anterior nuclei, dorsal median nuclei, intralaminar nuclei, and mamillothalamic tracts, corresponding closely to autopsy findings. *!! The most consistent and striking feature has been a Korsakoff amnesic syndrome. There is an anterograde and retrograde deficit with both verbal and nonverbal memory impairment. In our patient 2 with mainly a nondominant thalamic infarct, nonverbal memory was more severely affected. The visual perceptual deficits in our patients have also been found in classical alcoholic Korsakoff pa- tients. '* Apathy and lack of insight are other fea- tures typical of Korsakoff s syndrome. '* Confab- ulation was documented only in our patient 2 and in the patient of Barbizet et al. There is often improvement in the amnesia over a period of months in these patients and also in about 50% of patients with alcoholic Korsakoff s syndrome. !* Destruction of the dorsal median nuclei is the likely explanation of the amnesic syndrome, be- cause Victor et al! found these nuclei most con- sistently involved in patients with Korsakoff s syndrome resulting from thiamine deficiency. However, others! disagreed with the conclusions of Victor et al, ! and the lesions in our patient also involved adjacent thalamic areas. Our patients had no previous neurologic problems, only mild hypertension, and the lesions were restricted to the territory of a single vessel, supporting the role of the dorsal median nuclei or surrounding areas (such as the mamillothalamic tracts) in causing the amnesia. The initial stupor and subsequent hypersomnia could be attributed to bilateral lesions in the intralaminar nuclei, which are part of the rostral extension of the midbrain reticular acti- vating system. In addition to amnesia, subcortical dementia! has generally been found in these cases, as indicated by apathy and lack of spontaneity, slowness of thought and response, diminished facial expression, lack of aphasia and apraxia, and relatively pre- served IQ. The appearance of subcortical dementia with restricted thalamic lesions points to the pos- sible importance of thalamic involvement in caus- ing the mental changes of progressive supranuclear palsy and similar disorders. Other coexisting lesions cannot be ruled out in our patients, but the negative CT, apart from the thalamic lesions, the lack of a previous history of neurologic problems, the cor- respondence of the lesions to a particular vascular territory, and the restricted lesions at autopsy*!! suggest that the thalamic lesions (perhaps with some extension toward the midbrain) account for the clinical findings. Subcortical dementia has been recognized in slowly evolving neoplastic or degen- erative lesions affecting the thalamus bilater- ally. '*! These lesions usually affect the thalamus diffusely and often extend into extrathalamice re- gions such as both medial temporal areas and the mamillary bodies, making precise anatomoclinical correlations difficult. The transient asterixis in our patient 1 suggested impingement of the lesions initially on the internal capsule. Signs of corticospinal tract involvement were reported at the onset in two other cases. *> Uni- lateral asterixis has also been reported with midbrain infarction ! and thalamic hemorrhage with secondary mesencephalic involvement, suggesting that the upper mesencephalon may have been involved. The eye movement abnormalities, mainly re- stricted to vertical gaze and convergence impair- ment, have been seen in every case except that of Barbizet et al. ! However, as shown in one case, the vertical gaze abnormalities may be detected only by electro-oculography, which was not per- formed on the patient in Barbizet et al. ! In four cases, including our patient 1, vertical saccades were selectively impaired. Mills and Swanson used the term vertical oculomotor apraxia, because random involuntary vertical saccades were doc- May 1983 NEUROLOGY 33 543 Table 2.

As in our patient 1, downgaze has usually been more involved than upgaze. In anatomically documented cases of selective downgaze paralysis, the prerubral region has been involved at the me- sodiencephalic junction, **> and bilateral lesions of the interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus have been implicated. With occlusion of the anterior paramedian thalamosubthalamic artery, these centers are probably more affected than the more dorsally located centers for upgaze in the region of the pretectum and posterior com- misure. It is not known whether the impairment of vertical gaze can be attributed to the thalamic lesions per se (without mesencephalic involvement) , but the supranuclear fibers mediating vertical gaze may traverse the mesial thalamus, the most direct route to the pretectum and prerubral area. The mild aphasic disturbances seen in our patient 1, whose lesion was more extensive in the left thalamus, are similar to the speech deficits de- scribed in patients with left thalamic or putaminal hemorrhages. The patients described by Alexander and LoVerme2 showed diminished volume, im- paired naming, paraphasias, perseverations, and reduced spontaneous speech and word generation as well as attention and memory problems. This disorder can be considered a lacunar syn- drome in the distribution of the anterior para- median thalamosubthalamic arteries. Hyperten- sion was an antecedent in six reported cases, but embolization may sometimes be responsible, be- cause atrial fibrillation was present in one patient. When the patient presents in coma, diagnosis may be difficult, but evidence of asterixis and limitation of vertical gaze on oculocephalic and oculovestibular tests suggest bilateral paramedian thalamic in- farction. Once the patient regains consciousness, the combination of a hypersomnolent apathetic state, severe amnesia, and vertical saccadic ab- normalities are virtually diagnostic. Confirmatory evidence is provided by a CT showing enhancement, of both mesial thalami toward the end of the first week and, later, low-density lesions in the same areas.

D. , Christina R hrenbach, Ph. D. , and Marianne Regard, Ph. D. Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Ziirich, Switzerland Objective: To describe a patient who exhibited a partial Kliiver-Bucy syndrome after small bilateral ischemic lesions in the thalami. Background: Previously reported patients with Kliiver- Bucy syndrome had very large, mostly bilateral lesions in the limbic system and could not provide sufficient information about its anatomo-functional correlate. Method: Behavioral as- sessments and clinical examinations, including magnetic resonance imaging and positron emis- sion tomography, were conducted. Results: The patient was severely amnestic, distractible, hyperoral, and affectively dyscontrolled, and she behaved socially inappropriately. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral infarctions in the territories of both thalamoperforating arteries, and positron emission tomography revealed bilaterally decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the anterior parts of the ventral thalami and, to a lesser extent, in the fronto-temporal cortices. Conclusions: This behavioral syndrome has not yet been reported with isolated dien- cephalic lesions, but it has been observed after bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The authors conjecture that this syndrome resulted from a disruption of the pathways connecting the dorso- medial thalami with the prefrontal cortices and with other limbic areas, systems essential for memory and the regulation of impulses and emotions. (NNBN 1999; 12: 136-139) Kliiver and Bucy (1) described behavioral abnormali- ties after bilateral temporal lobe resection in monkeys that consisted of psychic blindness, oral tendencies, hyper- metamorphosis, emotional changes, and changes in sexual behavior, In humans, symptoms resembling the original description are observed after bilateral lesions of the lim- bic structures (2) . Although the full syndrome has never been reported, the main components of the Kltiver-Bucy syndrome are overattention to external stimuli or distract- ibility (hypermetamorphosis) , hyperorality with oral ex- ploration of objects, uncontrolled food intake, affective dyscontrol (e. g. , inappropriate social behavior, aggression, and lack of shame) , and severe amnesia (3) . Previous re- ports indicated a variety of possible causes, mostly en- cephalitis and degenerative and metabolic diseases (2, 4) .

Moreover, the only patient whose disease was reportedly caused by vascular insufficiency had large bitemporal lobe infarcts (5) . We present a patient with persistent symptoms of Kliiver-Bucy syndrome after an infarction in the terri- tory of both paramedian thalamic arteries. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old, right-handed woman was referred to the neurology clinic for her somnolent state. Before the isch- emic event, the patient was a healthy housewife and hobby painter with an active social and intellectual life. Her medical history was remarkable for chronic atrial fibrilla- tion treated with warfarin, arterial hypertension treated with enalapril and hydrochlorthiazide, and smoking (80 packs/year) . A neurologic examination revealed that the patient was somnolent and confused and had a complete vertical gaze palsy and severe memory problems. Mag- netic resonance imaging showed bilateral infarctions in the territory of both thalamoperforating arteries (Fig. 1) . The infarcted thalamic nuclei were identified using the co-planar stereotaxic atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (6) . PERSISTENT KLUVER-BUCY SYNDROME. 147 FIG. 1.

Extracranial color duplex and transcranial pulsed-wave Doppler studies showed turbu- lent flow in the precommunicating (P1) segment of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and hyperechogenic plaques in the left carotid bifurcation. Electrocardiography revealed atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rate. Find- ings of chest x-rays, transthoracal and transesophageal echocardiograms, and cerebrospinal fluid and extensive blood analyses were normal. The prothrombine time cor- responded to the international normalized ratio of 3. 5. An- ticoagulation was continued, and sotalol was adminis- tered. A mental status examination | month after the inci- dent revealed that the patient was still amnestic. When asked about the reason for her hospitalization, she indi- cated pain in her back and right hand. Her sense of time was lost. She had a number of severe behavioral abnormalities. She switched between lack of initiative and overactivity. She ate and smoked compulsively and stopped only when food or cigarettes were out of sight. She was highly distractable and reacted to every auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile cue. Objects with- in reaching distance were carefully explored by touching, twisting. and smelling them. Her spontaneous comments to stimuli were marked with personal and affective asso- ciations, A dialogue was not possible because she lost track of the theme and forgot what she was about to say or ask. Her social behavior was highly emotional: she touched strangers as if they were close friends and ex- pressed the desire to be touched affectionately. The patient also expressed a lack of shame: She walked about her room undressed, flirted, joked. and spontaneously ex- pressed her likes and dislikes. Although she was con- cerned about her appearance and liked to wear nice Vol. 12. No. 2, 1999 138 A. MULLER ET AL. clothes, she made no attempt to groom herself, nor did she ask for such help. The patient s amnesia was severe; she only recognized her closest family members (but not her caretakers) . How- ever, she made appropriate guesses of persons roles, in- dicating that she used some implicit cues. Her retrograde amnesia reached back decades. When asked her age, she at times responded that she was 35 years old, but she cor- rected this answer when subsequently asked and recalled the profession of her adult child. She recalled the places where she had lived but had no conception of time or chronologic order. She knew her birthday and present ad- dress (where she had been living for 4 years) , but she could not recall the brand name of her car or of her ciga- rettes (which she had been smoking for 25 years) . She could not recall public events or persons in the immediate or late past. Multiple-choice recognition revealed some preserved knowledge. Her anterograde amnesia was se- vere: She learned only three words from a 10-item list read to her three times and, 10 minutes later, was neither able to recall the task nor the stimuli. She could not learn the examiners names or the way back to her room. Her speech was fluent, but there was frequent echolalia and repetitive content. She could easily name objects, draw- ings, and colors. Comprehension, repetition, writing, and reading were normal and she had neither apraxia nor ag- nosia. She could not copy a simple figure because her movements were perseverative (overwriting) , and she lost track of the task and would begin to confabulate. Simi- larly, drawing to dictation was defective, e. g. , the drawing of a flower ended up as a girl. However, she was able to perform well-structured, 1-minute tasks (e. g. , category fluency, color -word interference task, and manual alter- nation) . The patient obtained occupational therapy for several weeks and was reexamined in our department 13 months after the onset of stroke. The vertical range of eye move- ments showed incomplete recovery, and downward gaze was less restricted (about 10 ) than upward gaze (about 5 ) . The amnestic syndrome was unchanged. Her behav- ioral alterations also persisted: She was too distractible to follow task instructions and commented on every present thing or person with blunt remarks of like or dislike. There were no new deficits, however, though she appeared more dysphoric and confused, especially when visually sepa- rated from her daughter. DISCUSSION Our patient developed marked behavioral alterations as a consequence of an ischemic stroke in the territory of both paramedian thalamic arteries. The term thalamic de- mentia (6) refers to behavioral changes and cognitive im- Neuropsychiatry, Neuropsychology, and Behavioral Neurology pairments, especially amnesia associated with thalamic le- sions, which fit the description of our patient. However, the specific behavioral abnormalities we observed are more precisely consistent with the syndrome described by Kliver and Bucy and consisting of hypermetamorphosis, placidity, hyperorality, and changes in emotional and sex- ual behavior. The lesions revealed by magnetic resonance imaging essentially involved bilateral dorsa] median and intralaminar nuclei as assessed by the stereotaxic atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (7) . These nuclei are irrigated by the paramedian thalamic arteries originating in the P1I- PCA. According to Percheron (8) , paramedian thalamic arteries arise on each side from the corresponding PCA or from a common trunk originating from one PCA. Conse- quently, the occlusion of one P1-PCA may cause infarcts in the territory of both paramedian thalamic arteries. The terrain supplied by the paramedian thalamic arteries also varies according to the region supplied by the posterior choroidal arteries and other branches of the PCA (9) . This explains the different anatomic extensions of both tha- lamic infarcts in our patient. The results of ancillary in- vestigations indicate that cardiac embolism to P1-PCA in the presence of suboptimal oral anticoagulation and chronic atrial fibriJlation was the most likely cause of our patient s thalamic stroke. Vertical gaze palsy probably resulted from extension of the infarct to midbrain structures, such as the rostral in- terstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the posterior commissure. As in our patient, such lesions are rarely detected with magnetic resonance imaging (10) . Amnesia is best explained by the interruption of pathways connecting the dorsomedial thalamus with limbic struc- tures of the temporal lobe, especially the amygdala and hippocampus (11) , and the behavioral alterations by dis- tuption of circuits connecting prefrontal areas with the thalamus, as shown with positron emission tomography. The persistence of the symptoms is in accordance with the lack of recovery of neuropsychologic deficits, such as am- nesia, in some patients with paramedian thalamic infarcts (12) .

MRI showed damage of both temporal poles and the lateral portion of the right prefrontal cortex. The pre- frontal and temporal cortical damage on the right side extended deeply into the white matter while the temporal cortical damage on the left side was much smaller. There was an additional left temporo-parietal lesion. The patient was of average intelligence. His attention, short term memory and learning ability were average or somewhat below aver- age. His old memories were severely affected for the personal-episodic domain and less so for semantic remote memory abilities. Therefore an anatomi- cal dissociation between anterograde and retrograde amnesia is possible at the anterior temporal regions, possibly interacting with the prefrontal cortex; these regions seem necessary for the retrieval of old episodic memories. (F Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1993: 56: 988-992) There are now descriptions of several cases of dissociation of anterograde and retrograde amnesia. '\"! In most of these cases the dam- age to the brain was the result of traumatic injury and can therefore be seen as resem- bling that described in several earlier reports in which concussions of the brain were fol- lowed by severe old memory disturbances. !??! Last century a number of reports already dealt with the phenomenon of retrograde amnesia. ? 4 Characteristic for most of the recent cases with dominant retrograde amnesia is the vari- ability of their brain damage and the relatively better preserved semantic or priming-related remote memory compared with the severely affected episodic old memories. (Semantic memory refers to general knowledge about the world, for example, grammar, mathematical relations, chemical formulas; priming to sub- conscious knowledge or facilitated identifi- cation of information previously exposed to, and episodic memory to personal, temporally dated events. ) In some case descriptions the retrograde amnesia related brain damage was identified in the junction zone of pons and mesencephalon, ? in the temporal, including the entorhinal cortex, in the temporo-parietal cortex, ! !!25 in the temporo-polar cortex, and Kopelman*? favoured the prefrontal cortex as the principal target region impli- cated in the retrieval of remote memories. In his 1991 article, Kopelman specifically sug- gested that dorsolateral frontal lesions (occurring in combination with limbic-dien- cephalic pathology) may account for an im- poverished retrieval of retrograde memories. Case report A 45 year old male patient had had a severe traumatic brain injury four years earlier, caused by falling off a horse. He had been comatose for about six weeks. Before his acci- dent the patient had been employed as a manager in a big company. He had been referred to us because of his persistent retro- grade memory deficits. His present neuro- logical status was examined with MRI and his neuropsychological status was tested during several sessions, over three days. Most of the behavioural findings of the patient are compared with those of a normal subject of an age of 52 years, comparable intelligence, and a similar occupational posi- tion as the patient. For the retrograde mem- ory tests additional comparisons were used. For the Autobiographical Memory Interview reference is made to the cut-off scores pro- vided in that test. Results in the Famous Faces Test ? are compared with those of a sample of control subjects tested by U Schuri (City Hospital Munich-Bogenhausen) , and for the Famous names test we collected our own data by testing five normal subjects of comparable or lower educational background and age. NEURORADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION MRI of his brain was performed using serial Tl and T2-weighted coronal and axial images (6 and 7 mm slices) . Both temporal poles, with preference to the right hemi- sphere, were severely affected. Furthermore, the basal and lateral part of the right temporal lobe was damaged, sparing, however, the medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampal formation, on both sides (fig) . Major brain damage was found in the fronto-basal cortex with preference to the right side. Additionally, an extensive cortico- subcortical lesion was situated in the left tem- poro-parietal transition zone.

They included tests of intelligence, attention, con- centration, sensory and language functions, and various forms of memory tests. A number of these tests had been used and described in detail in a previous publication of a case with bilateral thalamic damage. The patient appeared to be alert, and inter- ested. He made suggestions, was socially well-adjusted, and was able to interact in vari- ous ways with his environment. When instructed, he could remember to do some- thing or to go to a certain place. In formal testing, he gained an IQ of 100 points, his attention, measured by three tests, was slightly below average. In the Wechsler- Memory-Scale-R he received 85 points for the General-Memory-Index.

In the German version of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) he was below average, gaining 76 of 150 possible points. His short term memory was average. In tests measuring cognitive flexibility and concept formation ability, the patient s behaviour varied greatly. In the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test he was poor, in the Tower of Hanoi Test below average, and in concept formation and mathematical abilities he was average (see table 1) . Both verbal and non- verbal priming tasks gave evidence for gener- ally normal learning abilities under the tested conditions. RETROGRADE MEMORY As the main complaint of the patient s wife was that her husband is unable to remember nearly anything from his life before his acci- dent , we put particular emphasis on testing his retrograde memory abilities. We found that he had major memory disturbances which were most noticeable for personal memory, but also extended to his general knowledge. (table 2) . For testing general knowledge, we used a German version of the Warrington Famous Faces Test ? (provided by U Schuri) . In this test the patient is given portraits of a number Markowitsch, Calabrese, Liess, Haupts, Durwen, Gehlen Table 2 Performance (points) of the patient and the control subject in the Autobiographical Memory Test Control Cut-off Personal semantic events Patient subject scores [31]* Childhood 6 18 <1l Early adulthood 12 19-5 <14 Actual life 13-5 21 <17 Sum (max. : 63 points) 315 58-5 <47 Autobiographical incidents ildhood 0 9 <3 Early adulthood 0 9 <3 Actual life 6 9 <5 Sum (max. : 27 points) 6 27 <12 *The cut-off scores refer to definitely abnormal values; this means that the only not definitely abnormal (but border- line ) value was seen for the patient s recent autobiographical incidents, that is, for the current (post-injury) time period. of people (actors, politicians, sportsmen, etc) from different time periods, and he or she has to produce the name of the respective subject. In scoring his (and the control subject s) per- formance, we also gave points when a correct answer was given after helping the subject by presenting initials or first names. The patient was rated poor for the intermediate time peri- ods, but showed a gradient for remembering of famous faces from different decades (table 1) . Compared with a sample of control sub- jects that were tested, the only values in a normal range were found for the first and the last time period tested. We attributed the normal remembrance for the last time period to his less affected anterograde memory abili- ties, as his injury occurred in 1987. A similar performance was found for the Famous Names Test in which blocks of sev- eral names were given and the subject had to identify that of a person who was famous dur- ing a given epoch (multiple choice) . In a third measure, the Semantic General Knowledge Test (names of countries, curren- cies, cities, famous subjects, etc) , the patient gained 70 out of 100 possible points which reflected an existing semantic or even priming memory, similar to the patient described by Damasio et al. ?! Fourthly, the German language adaptation of the Autobiographical Memory Interview was given. The patient was clearly impaired in this test, but knew several overlearned per- sonal and a few autobiographical facts. The only score that was better than definitely abnormal (according to the score by Kopelman et al?*) was shown for his recent past, that is, the post-injury time period. For the last test we collected from the patient s wife a number of personal objects which the patient had used during different time stages before and after his accident (Personal Objects Test) . Of these we took five appropriate objects. For each of these five objects, verifiable and unequivocally dissocia- tive events were expected. Scoring was car- ried out as follows: The first point was given when the object was correctly recognised as a personal belonging. Each further detail was given a point. For example, the patient had bought a pocket watch (lst point) for Christmas 1982 (2nd point) for a horrendous price (3rd point) at an exceptional hour of the day (4th point) , and had later given it to his Retrograde amnesia after traumatic injury of the fronto-temporal cortex wife as a Christmas gift (5th point) . Though there were some favoured objects among this collection, the patient recognised only those from the earliest (1956-65) and half of the second time period (1966-75) as belonging to him; for the last term before his brain dam- age (1975-86) he recognised only one object. For reported details, he gave four altogether, three, and one for the three time periods. In the period between his injury and the present he again recognised four objects; all the four he recognised were from the period after his brain damage, while the fifth, unrecognised, was from the epoch before his accident. As an example of a possible dissociation between semantic and episodic memory, our patient when questioned about the location of Mount Kilimanjaro answered that it was situ- ated in Tanzania. He did not remember that he had climbed its peak shortly before his accident. (This fact is particularly interesting as most people would be unable to name the country, and of the few who could, most would probably think of Kenya instead. In fact, it is situated in both countries, but the peak can only be reached from the Tanzanian side. ) Another example is that he had been able to understand and to speak Italian on an advanced level before the trauma, but denied having any significant knowledge of the Italian language. As the principal examiner (PC) is a native Italian speaker, it was possi- ble to test this statement by requesting the patient to follow some instructions given in Italian. The patient executed all verbal instructions correctly so that at least he understood this foreign language and could therefore respond to it at the level of priming. Also his procedural memory remained largely intact giving a further example for dis- sociations among memory systems. The patient had been an avid car-driver since his youth and was able to drive before he was old enough to apply for a licence. After his acci- dent he took some driving lessons and was still considered capable of managing a car. Discussion Our patient can be considered a typical example of a case with dominant, but not exclusive, retrograde amnesia. Furthermore, his retrograde memory disturbances are un- equal with respect to true autobiographical and more impersonal, or semantic memory related knowledge. The formal test results on retrograde memory provide some support for this distinction (for example, considerable knowledge in the Semantic Knowledge Test, much better performance in the Auto- biographical incidents as opposed to the Personal semantic events part of the Autobiographical Memory Interview) , though not all results were clear-cut in this direction (for example, Famous Faces Test) . Clear evi- dence for this dissociation comes from the everyday life examples (such as, knowledge of the geographical locus of Mount Kilimanjaro, no remembrance of having climbed it him- self) . The patient s mnestic functions were 991 remarkably similar to those of Tulving s patient. Our patient showed the possible relations between retrograde memory disturbances and certain brain foci. It is very unlikely that any medial temporal lobe damage existed which could have contributed to his deficits. His damage nevertheless was not restricted to one focus, but included a combination of bilateral temporal and right-sided frontal damage. Very similar to the case given by Kapur et al* the temporal damage had its focus in the polar region and included some further, partly frontal, damage. We conclude from the overall picture of his anatomical damage and from comparing his case with those described previously that the typical case with dominant retrograde amne- sia can be characterised by a dominant (bilat- eral) temporo-polar focus with some adjacent, usually frontal-lobe, damage. This implies that the pathways interconnecting the anterior temporal cortex with the rest of the (association) cortex are severely disrupted. This may hold particularly to the uncinate fascicule, but also to pathways interconnect- ing the cingulate, retrosplenial, posterior tem- poral, and parietal cortex with the anterior temporal cortex. We cannot decide, to what degree the interruption of fibres relating the anterior temporal cortex to regions of amyg- dala and hippocampus and to thalamic nuclei are of importance. However, the findings by Iwai and Mishkin that the more anterior the temporal cortex is lesioned the more it affects memory, seems to receive new relevance, as do the recent findings by Sakai and Miyashita** who suggested from their electro- physiological recordings in the anterior tem- poral cortex of monkeys that this region might be activated in the retrieval process of memorised events. We also cannot specify the role of the frontal cortex in the context of retrograde amnesia. The role of this structure in time- sequencing behaviour and in the ordering of information and therefore in relating it to context and to order information along the dimension time, seem mechanisms which will very likely contribute to a proper memorising of remote information. ?>* In most of the cases described as having dominant retrograde amnesia, the aetiology of the brain damage is a traumatic one, involving a severe, sudden concussion which affects the brain along its anterior-posterior axis. '*1 19 Cases of amnesia pugilistica and amnesia after playing football may be simi- larly affected. !? 13 15 20 21 38 Descriptions of patients with totally intact anterograde amnesia, but severe retrograde amnesia are very rare and to date are not well documented. It therefore may be assumed that there is an interaction between both forms of amnesia, with the condition of more severe anterograde than retrograde memory defects being the most frequent, but not a necessary one. Especially under conditions of concussion- and coma-accompanied trau- matic brain injury with an involvement of the 992 temporal cortex (including its antero-lateral portion) , the reverse deficit pattern, namely a severe retrograde and a mild anterograde memory impairment, may occur. It seems to be characteristic for these cases that the con- dition is stable so that there is little hope of (insight-related) improvement of remote memories. We conclude from our present results and from those of previous studies that a severe interruption of the cortical fibre network interconnecting the anterior and posterior association areas of the cerebral cortex is a likely basis for remote memory impairments. A principal dissociation of anterograde and retrograde memory processing may therefore be possible on the neuroanatomical level. The medial portions of the temporal lobe includ- ing and surrounding the hippocampus may be necessary (though not sufficient) for the correct processing of new information, while the more lateral and anterior, largely neocor- tical portions may be necessary for the retrieval of memories.

The Role of the Mammillary Bodies in Memory: A Case of Amnesia Following Bilateral Resection Leigh J. Beglinger* Marc W. Haut** Michael W. Parsons** * Department of Psychiatry, University of lowa Carver College of Medicine ** Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, Department of Neurology, and Department of Radiology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, West Virginia USA ABSTRACT - Background and Objectives: Craniopharyngioma (CP) patients typically show good neuropsychiatric outcome following tumor resection. We present the case of a 51-year old woman who sustained damage to white matter pathways during surgery resulting in a disconnection of the Papez circuit (loss of bilateral mammillary bodies, columns of the fornix and mammillothalamic tracts) . Methods and Results: Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at 10 and 30 weeks post-operatively, and indicated both retrograde and severe anterograde amnesia, as well as persistent depression. At the second evaluation, most cognitive deficits had improved, but memory and mood deficits remained. Metamemory and priming remained intact. Conclusions: This case illustrates a profound neuropsychiatric morbidity associated with a surgery that is typically considered benign and confirms the well-known dissocia- tion between explicit recollection of newly learned information and less conscious forms of learning and memory. This rare pathology provides further information regarding the role of the mammillary bodies in memory. Received 10 August 2005 Accepted 3 February 2006 Despite being a histologically benign tumor, the adhesive nature and suprasellar location of craniopharyngiomas (CP) , with proximity to subcortical structures and criti- cal memory pathways, presents cognitive and psychiatric risks for patients undergo- ing surgical resection. As CPs predominate in the first two decades of life, the majority of research has focused on pediatric cogni- tive outcome. Pre- and post-operative exec- utive dysfunction and greater visuospatial than verbal intellectual deficits have been reported in children (Cavazzuti et al. 1983) . Most research on adult patients suggests improved neuropsychological functioning following resection (Honeggar et al. 1998) . While pre-treatment deficits have been observed in memory, verbal fluency, and executive skills (Donnet et al. 1999) , post- operative improvements to normal function- ing are common. Given frontal-subcortical circuitry involvement, patients are also at risk for psychiatric complications, specifi- cally depression (Spence et al. 1995) . Cases of cognitive impairment in CP patients have been correlated with surgical approach and outcome. Despite the need for retraction of the frontal lobes with some approaches, frontal dysfunction remains rela- tively uncommon. Donnet et al. (1999) found post-operative impairment in 5 of 22 CP patients on episodic memory and executive measures. However, poor surgical outcome (e. g. , hematoma and edema) , radiotherapy, and previous alcoholism were present in these 5 cases, confounding the results. There is one reported case of anterograde amnesia in a CP patient who sustained damage to the mammillary bodies (MB) alone (Tanaka et al. 1997) . Following resection, the patient improved on immediate memory, but re- mained amnestic after delays. Executive functions and other skills were largely unim- paired and there was no retrograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia is typically associat- ed with mesial temporal lobe damage, such as in the patient HM (Scoville & Milner 1957) , but has been described in association with other forms of pathology, such as lesions to the thalamus (Malamut ef al. 1992) , transection of the fornix and mammil- lothalamic tracts (Dusoir et al. 1990) , and basal forebrain lesions (Abe er al. 1998) . The capability of discrete MB lesions to produce amnesia is unclear. Certainly, atrophy of the mammillary bodies is a hallmark of Kor- sakoff syndrome (KS) , which produces both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Howev- ROLE OF MAMMILLARY BODIES INMEMORY 89 er, portions of the thalamus and hippocampus are also involved in KS (Aggleton & Brown 1999, Fama et al. 2004) and recent reports have shown both amnesia in the presence of intact MBs and damaged MB in alcoholic patients who did not suffer from amnesia (Sullivan et al. 1999) . Animal studies suggest that selective MB lesions are not sufficient (Zola-Morgan et al. 1989) , but as noted above, Tanaka and colleagues (1997) report- ed a case of persistent anterograde amnesia in a patient with atrophic MB and intact sur- rounding memory structures. Thus the role of the MB in amnesia remains imprecise. Recently, Hildebrandt et al. (2001) pre- sented a case of bilateral MB atrophy with an infarct of the left MB. They evaluated the model proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999) in which a dissociation of free recall (impaired) and recognition (spared) is pro- posed for bilateral damage to structures with- in the Circuit of Papez, such as the MB. According to this model, recognition memo- ry should be relatively spared because feel- ings of familiarity are hypothesized to be supported by perirhinal cortex. Their patient showed impaired anterograde (episodic) memory, poor source and recency memory, and relatively spared learning over repetition. Recognition results were mixed with spared recognition only when distractors were items not previously used (i. e. , the patient was sus- ceptible to interference) . These results sug- gest limited support for the Aggleton & Brown model, due to the fact that both free recall and recognition were impaired in this patient. Further, they suggested that the dien- cephalon is implicated in memory for con- text, a function typically associated with the frontal lobes and thalamus, but not previous- ly with the MB (Dobbins et al. 2002, Smith & Milner 1983) . Thus, the specific role of the MB in human memory remains in question, although there 90 LEIGH J. BEGLINGER ET AL. is accumulating evidence of its importance. To our knowledge, we present the first case of bilateral MB removal in the context of CP resection. We present the case of a 51-year old woman who suffered a disconnection of the hippocampal-limbic system through loss of the MB and columns of the fornix. This unique pathology allows for the exploration of memory functions including 1) recall vs. recognition, 2) learning, 3) implicit memory and priming and 4) contextual memory, as measured by a frequency judgment task (see below) . We anticipated that recognition would be more preserved than recall, that new learning would be severely impaired and that implicit and contextual memory would be spared. Method Case Report BR was a 51-year old, right-handed Cau- casian woman with a GED education and no prior neurologic or psychiatric history (neg- ative for prior depression) , who presented to her physician with a visual field defect and was diagnosed with a CP by MRI 6 months later. Treatment was by surgical resection via right orbitofrontal craniotomy one month post-diagnosis. Surgical notes des- cribed a difficult resection due to adherence of the CP to surrounding structures and dif- ficulty differentiating it from healthy tissue. Her hospital course was complicated by panhypopituitarism, lower extremity deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli. Throughout her hospital stay, the patient was described as disoriented, confused and agitated. She was referred for a neuropsy- chological evaluation approximately 10 weeks after surgery due to persistent memo- ry deficits. Post-Operative Brain Imaging Findings MRI 8 weeks post surgically with diffu- sion-weighted images revealed the absence of the pituitary stalk, mammillary bodies, and columns of the fornix, a small (4 mm) ACoA aneurysm, and small hemorrhage in the right caudate head and anterior putamen. The aneurysm and hemorrhage were new findings not seen on pre-surgical imaging. CT 4 months post surgically showed decreased attenuation surrounding the anteri- or horn of the right lateral ventricle, sugges- tive of surgical trauma or encephalomalacia, and the previous lacune. Repeat MRI 9 months post surgically showed the same findings, with decreased size of the basal ganglia lacune and a small number of punc- tate hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes (Figure 1) . Neuropsychological Test Results The patient completed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination 10 weeks post-surgically. She was grossly disoriented to day and date, stating that she lived in anoth- er state (she had moved 3 years previously) and miscalculating her age by one year. She was unaware of the surgery and had patchy retrograde amnesia for a 5-6 month period preceding the surgery (e. g. she was unable to recall Christmas or that her husband had retired) . Anterograde amnesia was evident in her inability to store new memories for longer than 10 minutes, with only one overnight memory reported. She stated, I don t know what I have done and what I have dreamed. Affect alternated between tearful and restrict- ed, with lack of facial expressiveness and poor eye contact. Reported mood was depressed with associated significant func- tional decline. Spontaneous speech was slow. Sensorimotor testing revealed bilateral lower quadrant visual field defects (presumably the result of the CP and resection in proximity to the optic chiasm and tracts) , bilateral motor slowing and diminished strength, dysdiado- chokinesis, and slow acquisition of a new motor sequence. Although there was no obvi- ous indication of a marked dysexecutive syn- drome (e. g. , difficulty with set shifting, inap- ROLE OF MAMMILLARY BODIES INMEMORY 91 propriate behavior) and she had some aware- ness of her deficits, she displayed some evi- dence of apathy (reduced initiation) and per- severation (echopraxis on a go/no-go task) . Complete results of the formal neuropsy- chological exams are presented in Table I. Although no premorbid cognitive assessment was completed, her word knowledge (Vocab- Figure 1. Shows a: g (left side of image = left side of subject) . The ime agittal, and coronal images of pt. BR (left) and a healthy 44 y. o. female (right) for comparison es clearly demonstrate the absence of the mamillary bodies in the patient, as well as the loss of the columns of the fornix inferiorly. In the coronal montage, the anterior commissure can be visualized. Immediately anterior to this structure is the relatively intact medial septal nucleus. fornix is intact as well. The absence of the mamillary bodies indicates that the mammillothalamic tract must al on of whether a few fibers remain that connect directly from the fornix to the anterior lesioned. The remaining qu ural be uggesting that the precom: nuclear group can not be definitively resolved from these images. Also present, but not visible in these images is a small residual hemorrhage in right caudate head.

Confrontation naming was above average and is correlated with education and intellect. To summarize the exam, performance was grossly normal (within 1. 5 standard deviations of the mean) on most tests of visuomotor skills, language, simple attention, and executive functioning. In contrast, both visual and verbal memory were severely impaired, with flat learning curves, absent recall at delay, and no improve- ment with recognition procedures. Striking perseveration was seen across tasks. She was also impaired on tests of complex attention that required manipulation of information in working memory (Auditory Consonant Tri- grams and Paced Auditory Serial Additions Test) . She returned for follow-up at 30 weeks, at which time an abbreviated battery with repeated tests was given, in addition to sever- al new memory tests. Some improvements in 92 LEIGH J. BEGLINGER ET AL. executive skills were demonstrated (Wiscon- sin Card Sorting Test and verbal fluency) with no significant change in attention or working memory. However, perseveration and lack of inhibition on motor testing remained and per- formance on two executive tests did not improve (Similarities and Trails B) . No func- tional improvement in memory was achieved, with most recall scores at zero after a distrac- tion. However, the patient had stored several memories for 24 hours and could report that she had undergone surgery, although one month of retrograde amnesia and day, date, and time disorientation remained. Depression and functional status improved, but remained abnormal (e. g. , continued flat affect, psy- chomotor retardation and dependency) . To further explore her memory system, two experimental tasks, a word stem priming test (Haut et al. 1995) and a frequency mem- ory measure (i. e. , ability to estimate the num- ber of times a word was read from a long list, without being cued to attend to this) were administered. On the word stem task, B. R. was shown 60 words printed on cards and was asked for each word to answer whether it either rhymed with another word (acoustic processing) or was a member of a category (semantic processing) , thereby assuring some level of processing of each word. Following this presentation, she was asked to complete 3 letter word stems with the first word that came to mind. Half the stems were from the presentation list and half were new. She showed intact priming with a 33% benefit from prior exposure (normal = 40%; Haut et al. 1995) ; recognition of which words were on the list remained at chance. Frequency memory was assessed by presenting a study list of words each between one and six times. B. R. was then asked to estimate how many times she had heard each word on the list. Her judgments were normal at 78% accuracy (controls = 76% +/ - 8%; Haut et al. 2001) , but she showed impaired recognition judg- ment when asked to identify the target words from among distractor words (67% accuracy compared to 98% +/ - 1. 3% in controls) . Discussion We present a case of loss of the bilateral mammillary bodies, columns of the fornix, and mammillothalamic tracts in a patient who underwent a difficult surgical resection of a CP. The case displays a rare and severe mem- ory impairment with comorbid persistent depression. This unique lesion allowed us to explore the memory system and to address questions regarding the role of the MB in recall, recognition, learning, implicit memory and contextual memory. The presence of per- sistent depression may also be related to the subcortical damage sustained by this surgery; similar mood alterations are reported in stroke patients with left hemisphere lesions to the basal ganglia (Robinson & Starkstein 1989) . Neuropsychological testing revealed nor- mal range performance on tests without episodic memory demands at 30 weeks post- operatively; however, retrograde and antero- grade amnesia were present. Importantly, we did not observe a dissociation between free recall and recognition, as proposed by the Aggleton & Brown model (1999) in cases of bilateral damage to the Papez circuit. Overt recognition ranged from low average to severely impaired, consistent with the patient described by Hildebrandt (2001) . Impaired consolidation is suggested by poor free recall with no benefit from recognition cues. In contrast, BR showed spared priming and context memory. Priming is typically pre- served in patients with amnesia and is mediat- ed by a cortical network independent of the mesial temporal structures (e. g. , Schachter ROLE OF MAMMILLARY BODIES INMEMORY 93 Table I Neuropsychological Test Scores at 10 and 30 Weeks Post CP Resection Test 10 Weeks Post-Op 30 Weeks Post-Op) Raw Score Percentile Raw Score Percentile MMSE 22 <l 21 <1 Visuospatial Digit Symbol 50, pairing = 0, free 9, Pairing/ Pairing = 1, Pairing = |, recall = 2 recall = floor recall =6 recall = 27 Judgment Line Orientation 17 9 Block Design 25 16 Span/Working Memory Digit Span 13 (5 forward, 16 13 (6 forward, 16 4 back) 3 back) Auditory Consonant Trigrams 32/60, 27 perseverations 30/60 Trail Making: A & B 46 sec, 78 sec 21, 37 28 sec, 81 sec 79, 32 Paced Auditory Serial Additions Test Unable to complete Unable to complete Language Vocabulary 37 25 Boston Naming Test 57 63 COWAT/Animal 22 (10 animals) 8, 8 33 (14 animals) 39, 30 Memory Logical Memory I & II 1=8, Il=0, 1=2 II = floor I= 16, 1=1, 1=16 recognition = 13/20 recognition = 11/20 II = floor Hopkins VLT (Trials 1-3, 4) 5, 3, 6, Delay = 0 < | (total) 5, 6, 5, < | (total) Delay = floor Delay =0 Delay = floor HVLT Recognition Discrimination 10 16 8 <i Recognition Memory Test 24/50 words, 34/50 faces <1, 1 31 words, 32 faces 1, 1 Visual Reproduction I & II 1=20, 1 =4, recog= 1/5 1=6 I= floor [= 23, 1=0, T=13 recog = 2/5 II = floor Executive Stroop Color and Word 90, 70, 34 19, 25, 14 Similarities 17 16 16 16 Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 42 errors, 14-27 20 errors, 39-58 32 perseverations 3 perseverations Note: percentile scores below 7 are equivalent to 1. 5 standard deviations below the mean and generally represent impairment. 1987, Squire & Graf 1987, Goshen-Gottstein et al. 2000) . Our patient showed intact con- textual memory (e. g. frequency memory, source memory) , which has previously been shown to be preserved in patients with MTL damage and is thought to depend on fronto- parietal networks that mediate working mem- ory and metamemory (e. g. , Haut et al. 2001, Smith & Milner 1988, Jurado et al. 1997 ) . Using the same frequency memory task used with BR, Haut et al. (2001) found fMRI acti- vation during the frequency memory task in healthy controls in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. They further showed a dissociation between frontal and hippocampal activation with frequency versus recognition judgments (no hippocampal activation for frequency) , supporting the role of the frontal lobes in memory for frequency of occurrence. This finding contrasts with the patient described by Hildebrandt (2001) and contradicts their pro- posal of MB involvement in this form of con- textual memory. Instead, the previous litera- ture implicating a network of cortical structures (prefrontal cortex, posterior pari- etal cortex, posterior cingulate, and pre- 94 LEIGH J. BEGLINGER ET AL. cuneus) for contextual memory is supported. Importantly, modification of recognition memory through practice has been more promising than of frequency memory (Zacks et al. 1982) . This may have implications for interventions with patients such as BR, and may offer an explanation for her perceived improvements in memory and functional status. We propose that the amnesia in this patient, whose mesial temporal structures are intact, is due to disruption of the white matter pathways responsible for transmis- sion of information through the limbic sys- tem. This finding is similar to previous cases (e. g. , Dusoir et al. 1990, Abe et al. 1998, Tucker et al. 1988) , in which global amnesia resulted from disconnection of the hip- pocampus from the MB and basal forebrain. The presence of significant temporal disori- entation, which has been associated with the anterior nuclei (Clarke er al. 1994) , and other thalamic and fornix lesions (Shuren et al. 1997, Yasuno et al. 1999) further sup- ports our contention of a functional discon- nection of the hippocampus and thalamus. Brain imaging on BR clearly demon- strates the loss of the MB and the columns of the fornix, but it is unclear whether traces of the postcommissural fornices may have been spared. These fibers synapse directly with the anterior nuclei of the thalamus and may support memory function in the absence of the MB (Carpenter & Sutin 1983) . Connec- tions to the thalamus via the amygdalofugal pathway are another potential route from the limbic structures to the thalamus (Crosson 1992) . BR s ability to recall a few bits of information by 30 weeks post-surgery may be accounted for by the presence of these pathways. Further advances in imaging white matter pathways (i. e. , diffusion tensor imaging) may provide the detail necessary to answer these questions in the future. In summary, this case illustrates three important points: 1. ) given the typical loca- tion of the tumor, CP resection can present significant (albeit rare) neuropsychiatric risks to the patient. 2. ) amnesia can occur in the presence of intact hippocampi, due to disruption of their white matter connections to the diencephalon. 3. ) this case provides new support for a distributed cortical net- work, but not mammillary body, involve- ment in contextual memory.

Whether diencephalic and temporal lobe amnesias are distinct entities is still not clear. We investigated episodic memory for faces using functional MRI (fMRI) in eight controls and in a 34-year- old man with Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome and diencephalic lesions but without medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement at MRI. fMRI was performed with a |. 5 tesla unit. Three dual-choice tasks were employed: (i) face encoding (18 faces were randomly presented three times and subjects were asked to memorize the faces) ; (ii) face perception (subjects indicated which of two faces matched a third face) ; and (iii) face recognition (subjects indicated which of two faces belonged to the group they had been asked to memorize during encod- ing) . All activation was greater in the right hemisphere. In controls both the encoding and recognition tasks activated two hippocampal regions (anterior and posterior) . The anterior hippocampal region was more activated during recognition. Activation in the prefrontal cortex was greater during recognition. In the subject with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, fMRI did not show hippocampal activation during either encoding or recognition. During recognition, although behavioural data showed defective retrieval, the prefrontal regions were activated as in controls, except for the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. fMRI activation of the visual cortices and the behavioural score on the perception task indicated that the subject with Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome perceived the faces, paid attention to the task and demonstrated accurate judgement. In the subject with Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome, although the anatomical damage does not involve the MTL, the hippocampal memory encoding has been lost, possibly as a consequence of the hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis involvement. Anterograde amnesia could therefore be the expression of damage to an extended hippocampal system, and the distinction between temporal lobe and diencephalic amnesia has limited value. In the subject with Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome, the preserved dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during incorrect recognition suggests that this region is more involved in either the orientation or attention at retrieval than in retrieval. The lack of activation of the prefrontal ventrolateral cortex confirms the role of this area in episodic memory formation.

Both disorders are caused by thiamine deficiency and are found mainly in chronic alcoholics but also in cases of persistent vomiting, gastric carcinoma or other disturbances of the alimentary tract (Victor et al. , 1989) . The cardinal feature of the Korsakoff syndrome is severe and disproportionate anterograde memory loss in an other- wise alert and responsive patient. Patients suffering from this amnesic syndrome show degeneration of diencephalic regions: the mammillary bodies and periventricular regions, especially the anterior thalamic nucleus (Harding et al. , 2000) . Anterograde amnesia resulting from diencephalic damage resembles amnesia following medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Whether these two types of amnesia should be considered as independent is still a matter of debate. The extensive ana- tomical connections between the temporal lobe, the mammil- lary bodies and the thalamus on the one hand and the position of the diencephalon connecting the MTL and the frontal lobe on the other suggest a crucial role of the diencephalon in the network underlying memory formation (Vann and Aggleton, 2004) . Both the MTL and the diencephalon could be con- sidered part of a single system for acquiring new declarative memories. Therefore, both amnesic syndromes could be variants of a disorder involving the same cerebral network (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Alternatively, damage to the diencephalic structures could result in widespread dysfunc- tion of cortical regions, disrupting memory formation and retrieval without involvement of the MTL (Mair, 1994) . We used functional MRI (fMRI) to study memory pro- cesses for facial episodic recognition to clarify the relationship between the MTL and diencephalic amnesia in eight healthy volunteers and in a subject with Wernicke-Korsakoff (WK) syndrome with diencephalic damage but without MTL involvement. Material and methods Subjects A 34-year-old, non alcoholic, right-handed man with oesophageal stenosis after surgery for cancer, persistent vomiting and severe mal- nutrition was admitted because of gait unsteadiness and confusional state. Neurological examination performed 3 days later showed a global confusional state and drowsiness, dysarthria, ophthal- moparesis, nystagmus and ataxia. A clinical diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy was made and thiamine treatment (100 mg/day intramuscularly) initiated. After 5 days the patient was alert and attentive but presented retrograde amnesia and severe anterograde amnesia. Five months after onset, ataxia and ophthalmoparesis had disappeared, retrograde amnesia shrank, but dense anterograde amnesia was still present. A neuropsychological examination was performed 4 weeks and 5 months after onset using the following tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) , the Prose Brain (2005) , 128, 1584-1594 1585 Table | Neuropsychological tests and scores 4 weeks and 5 months after onset 4 weeks 5 months MMSE (range 0-30) 22 27 Prose Memory test (range 0-28) 15 4 *Rey Complex Figure (range 0-36) Immediate 29 Immediate 31 Delayed 3 Delayed 4 Gollin Incomplete Pictures 50 55 Test (range 0-60) WAIS-R Digit Symbol 79 82 Subtest (range 0-90) WAIS Information Subtest 17 21 (range 0-29) Crovitz test (range of mean 0. 5 15 score for each episode 0-3) *Copy was correctly performed in both examinations. Memory test, the Rey Complex Figure, Crovitz test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Information subtest, the Gollin Incomplete Pictures Test, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol subtest. Results (raw scores) are reported in Table 1. At 4 weeks the low score obtained on the MMSE revealed reduced global cognitivity. Poor performances on the Prose test and the Rey Complex Figure delayed recall test documented a severe anterograde episodic memory loss. The good performance observed in the immediate recall on the Rey Complex Figure test could be explained by the relative preservation of attention and visuospatial/constructional abilities. Immediate and non-declarative memory was preserved, as proved by the scores in the Gollin and Digit Symbol tests. The score obtained in the WAIS Information subtest demonstrated intact semantic mem- ory storage. A low score on the Crovitz test showed an important deficit in remote autobiographical memory, also observed during the clinical interview, which revealed retrograde amnesia spanning approximately 2 years. At 5 months the global level of cognitive functions returned within the normal range. We did not find sig- nificant changes on the declarative (verbal and non-verbal) memory test as a whole, although a slight improvement in relative scores was evident. The scores on semantic and non-declarative tests were slightly improved. A better performance on the Crovitz test was concordant with the improvement in retrograde amnesia, which had declined, as inferred by clinical interview, and spanned approxi- mately 10 months. Anatomical MRI studies were performed using standard (spin- echo, turbo spin-echo and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; FLAIR) sequences 7 days, 4 weeks and 5 months after the onset of symptoms. During the last two sessions, fMRI studies with the blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast (BOLDc) technique were performed using a block paradigm to test memory for faces. Eight healthy right-handed men (30-40 years) were recruited as controls for the fMRI study. All subjects gave informed consent. This study had received prior approval from our institutional Ethics Committee. Functional MRI Recordings BOLDc functional imaging was performed using a Siemens Magnetom Vision scanner with 1. level and a cluster size of at least four voxels was required in order to obtain a corrected (for multiple compar- isons) significance level: the probability of a false detection for the entire functional volume was P< 0. 05, as estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (3dFWHM and AlphaSim routines of AFNI package; Forman et al. , 1995; Cox, 1996) . Regions of interest (ROI) were determined for each control and for the WK subject, considering the mask obtained from the union of voxels activated in each con- dition separately. Talairach coordinates of the defined ROI were obtained from the centroids of clusters of activation. The mean time course of each ROI was analysed and the relative signal variation between baseline (off condition) and each task was calculated from the fitted parameters of the general linear model in order to analyse the effect of the different task conditions: BOLD% change = ( x 100) /baseline, where B represents the estimated amplitude of the variation in the fMRI signal. This analysis was restricted to the ROI of activated cortical regions that have been indicated in the literature as having a major role in face memory processing: the prefrontal cortex (ventrolateral and dorsolateral) , MTL structures and a visual cortical region (fusiform gyrus) (Kelley et al. , 1988; Clark et al. , 1996; Haxby et al. , 1996; Kanwisher et al. , 1997) . The BOLD signal of the insular and medial Brain (2005) , 128, 1584-1594 1587 prefrontal cortex was also analysed. The regional comparison of activation for the control group was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. The dependent variable of the ANOVA analysis was the BOLD signal relative variation between the task and off conditions; the factors were the memory task (encoding, perception, recognition) and the selected ROI. The Duncan test was used for post hoc comparisons. Activation in the subject was considered significantly different when it was greater than 2 SD with respect to controls. In addition a voxel-wise analysis was performed by concatenating controls and the WK subject s voxel time courses to look for cortical regions showing differences between conditions (encoding versus perception, and recognition versus perception) in the WK patient but not in controls and vice versa. In this analysis we used a less stringent threshold (P< 0. 001, uncorrected) in order to exclude false negatives. Results Anatomical MRI Signal changes involving the mammillary bodies, the medial thalamic region and the fornix, in the absence of any signal abnormalities in MTL structures, were observed 1 week after clinical onset (Fig. 2A) . The 5-month follow-up study demon- strated almost complete resolution of the lesions and absence of signal changes in the MTL (Fig. 2B) . An expert neurora- diologist made a visual qualitative evaluation of brain atrophy using morphological MRI sequences. No signs of generalized or focal MTL atrophy were detected in the 4-week and 5-month MRI studies. fMRI findings Controls Analysis of fMRI data comparing the on and off conditions revealed that activated areas were bilateral during each task but with relative right lateralization. The control group map of cumulative cortical activation for all tasks revealed enhancement of several cortical regions: a region in the medial surface of the frontal lobe (medial prefrontal cortex, MPFC) ina position generally attributed to the supplementary motor area (Fig. 3) ; two confluent bilateral regions, one anterior and one posterior, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a cluster of activation in the low convexity involving the pars opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, VLPFC) and the insular cortex (Fig. 3) . Given the close position of the insula and inferior frontal gyrus and of the two regions of activation of the DLPFC, the group analysis showed confluent activa- tions, whereas analysis of the individual subjects distinguished two distinct cortical areas. The insular cortex was also acti- vated in the left hemisphere. Regions of cortical activation were present in the bilateral ventral occipitotemporal cortex and included the fusiform gyrus (Fig. 3) . In this region it was also necessary to look at individual activations in order to distinguish the fusiform gyrus from the rest of the extrastriatal Fig. 2 Images from axial and coronal FLAIR sequence of the WK subject.

In the MTL, the hippocampus was activated in two distinct regions, one anterior and one posterior (Fig. 4) . WK subject Because at the 5-month follow-up the severity of anterograde amnesia the fMRI activations and the behavioural data were similar to the study performed at 4 weeks, we merged the data from the two fMRI examinations. At the selected threshold, the activations showed marked right hemisphere predominance. The areas of activation in the DLPFC, MPFC, insula and ventral occipitotemporal cortex (including the fusiform gyrus) resembled those observed in the control group (Fig. 3) . The list of activated areas and corresponding Talairach coordinates is reported in Table 2. Activated areas in the MTL and VLPFC were not observed at the statistical threshold of P < 0. 05 (corrected) . Even at a less rigorous threshold (P < 0. 001 uncorrected) , activated voxels were not detected in these regions. In order to further reduce the possibility of false negatives, the fMRI signals for these cortical areas were derived from ROI determined using the respective ROI obtained from the group analysis of the controls. The Talairach normalization can account only partially for the intersubject anatomical variability. Therefore, in addition to the use of Talairach coordinates we also visually checked the overlapping of the group s ROI with the patient s cortical anatomy on the basis of known anatomical land- marks. In order to avoid a methodological bias, the BOLD response in these regions for each normal subject was also evaluated considering the group ROI, in addition to the evaluation performed using individual ROI. fMRI in Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome Controls WK subject MPFC (SMA) Insula and IFG (VLPFC) yy Ventral occipitotemporal cortex Fig. 3 Activated areas during the on condition in controls (left column) and the WK subject (right column) .

The region of activation in the posterior hippocampus showed a significantly greater BOLD signal during encoding and recognition than during perception, whereas differences did not exist between encoding and recognition (Fig. 5C) . The BOLD signal of the fusiform gyrus was significantly greater during recognition and perception than during encoding. Statistically significant differences were not observed between recognition and perception (Fig. 5D) . Levels of significance of the post hoc comparison of the BOLD signal change during the three different tasks in each ROI are reported in Table 3. Comparison of cortical activation of the control group versus the WK subject demonstrated a precise match in the DLPFC, MPFC, insula and fusiform gyrus. However, the patient failed to activate the MTL and the VLPFC during each condition. The voxel-wise analysis, testing for differences between conditions in the WK subject compared with controls, did not show further regions of activation other than those which entered the ANOVA analysis. | Controls mWK subject MPFC (SMA) 0. 8 0. 7 2 ae ' 0. 6 Perception Recognition Encoding Perception Recognition] Encoding Controls mWK subject gControls mK subject IFG (VLPFC) 08 0. 7 06 il \\ = i i . , a i | a Encoding e ion Recognition] Encoding Perception Recognition | Controls mWK subject Posterior Hippocampus Anterior Hippocampus ~LLe aM = Encoding Perception Recognition Encoding Perception Recognition wCortrols mWK subject Fusiform gyrus 18 16 Recognition Fig. 5 BOLD % signal changes in different cortical regions during task execution in controls and the WK subject.

Mean correct responses were 88. 6 + 3. 8% (range 83-94%) for perception and 83. 5 + 4. 2% (range 78-89%) for recognition. WK subject Cumulative correct responses of the two fMRI studies were 98% for encoding and 88% for perception. These results were not significantly different from those for controls. Correct responses for recognition were 54%, which was significantly lower than the figure for controls. Discussion Patients with WK syndrome present persistent anterograde episodic memory loss with preserved semantic memory, intel- ligence and learned behaviour (Kopelman, 1995) . The severe anterograde memory loss is similar to the amnesia that is associated with MTL lesions in humans and experimental animals (Squire, 1992; Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . There are a number of recent fMRI and PET studies indicating facial encod- ing was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right MTL and left prefrontal cortex, whereas facial recognition was associated with increased rCBF in an M. Caulo et al. extensive region of the right prefrontal cortex (Haxby et al. , 1996) . We employed a modified version of the paradigm developed by Haxby and colleagues. Since we were dealing with a patient with memory impairment, we thought that a shorter study would increase the probability that the subject would complete it with adequate collaboration. Therefore we choose a block-design fMRI study, which generally yields more robust activation compared with an event related study of the same duration (Friston et al. , 1999) . In our fMRI study we found that in controls a right poster- ior hippocampal region is activated by both facial encoding and recognition, whereas a more anterior hippocampal region is greatly activated in recognition. The prefrontal cortex (greater on the right) was activated during all tasks, especially during recognition. The discrepancies in the reported studies may be due to the differences in techniques and paradigms employed. The lateralization within MTL and the prefrontal cortex has been demonstrated to be dependent on the type of material being remembered (Kelley et al. , 1998) . The left frontal and medial temporal network is predominantly activated by verbal stimuli whereas a contralateral network is activated by non-verbal stimuli, such as faces. Therefore, we will only discuss activations of the right hemisphere. The cortex of the fusiform gyrus has been demonstrated to be selectively specialized in facial perception (Haxby et al. , 1994; Kanwisher et al. , 1997) ; therefore, we focused our ana- lysis on this region. In our controls and the WK subject, the bilateral activations of the cortex of the fusiform gyrus were comparable. In both controls and the WK subject the greater activation of the fusiform gyrus during the perception and recognition compared with the encoding task could be due either to the number of faces employed in each task (one in encoding, two in recognition, three in perception) or to the different attention levels (Wojciulik et al. , 1998) . In the WK subject {MRI showed no activation of MTL during encoding, although the behavioural scores indicated that faces were seen, attention was good and judgement was accurate. Moreover, the normal activation of the cortex of the fusiform gyrus excludes haemodynamic impairment of the cortical-visual network as a possible cause of the lack of MTL activation. During recognition, the activations observed in the prefrontal regions were not significantly different from those in controls, except for the inferior frontal cortex. How- ever behavioural data indicated impaired recognition. These findings suggest that MTL activation during encoding is cru- cial for subsequent recognition memory for faces and that activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be more involved in orientation and/or attention at retrieval than in retrieval per se (Dobbins et al. , 2003) . The inferior frontal cortex is thought to be involved in the elaborative encoding of information into episodic memory, as well as in the main- tenance of retrieved information (Fletcher and Henson, 2001; Dobbins et al. , 2002) . Therefore, its lack of activation seems to be more specifically connected with the defective encoding and unsuccessful retrieval in WK. Although the poor memory fMRI in Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome performance of the patient and the associated activation deficits in the MTL and the IFC are consistent with recent literature (Bunge et al. , 2004) , we cannot exclude some addi- tional problems of the patient in retrieving and/or perceiving faces, not detected by our paradigm, that may influence the differences in BOLD signal between patient and controls. No activation differences were found between subject and controls in the MPFC and the insula. As generally acknowl- edged, the MPFC is involved in motor behaviour (Picard and Strick, 2001) , whereas activation of the insula is found in most tasks requiring visual attention (Woldorff et al. 2004) . The lack of differences in these regions, which are involved in the demands of general processing, supports the specificity of the activation deficits found in regions related to memory formation in the WK subject. Neuropathological studies in alcoholic Korsakoff syn- drome have identified the dorsal medial thalamic nuclei as the anatomical site of pathology (Victor and Adams, 1989) . Harding and colleagues, using operational criteria to identify alcoholics with and without Korsakoff syndrome (Caine et al. , 1997) , demonstrated that neuronal loss in the anterior tha- lamic nuclei is the best predictor of memory loss (Harding et al. , 2000) . This supports the view that the hippocampal anterior thalamic axis is critical for episodic memory for- mation (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Damage to this axis is responsible for the anterograde amnesia in Korsakoff syn- drome, as originally proposed by Delay and Brion (1969) . Pathology and MRI studies support the view that hippocam- pal structures are not damaged in WK syndrome (Squire et al. , 1990; Harding et al. , 1997; Colchester et al. , 2001) . The patient we report is not an alcoholic. MRI showed lesions in the diencephalic structures matching the classical descriptions of Wernicke encephalopathy (Gallucci et al. , 1990) . MRI did not show signal abnormality or cortical atro- phy in the MTL structures in either the 4-week or 5-month studies. There were also no signs of generalized cortical atro- phy. Nonetheless, fMRI did not demonstrate hippocampal activation during encoding, the initial step of episodic mem- ory formation. A PET study in two WK patients documented, besides the expected hypometabolism in the diencephalic grey matter, hypometabolism of MTL structures (Reed et al. 2003) . This finding was interpreted as a secondary metabolic effect of the diencephalic pathology. Several experimental studies have demonstrated that anterior thalamic damage disrupts normal hippocampal activity (Jenkins et al. , 2002; Savage et al. , 2003) . In conclusion, in the patient we report here, MRI confirms that Korsakoff syndrome is related to",

Sequences parameters were: repetition 1586 Brain (2005) , 128, 1584-1594 time (TR) 2s, echo time (TE) 60 ms, matrix size 64 x 64, field of view 256 mm, in-plane voxel size 4 x 4 mm, flip angle 90 , slice thickness 5 mm, and no gap. Foam padding was added to the standard head coil in order to minimize involuntary subject movement. Functional volumes consisted of 16 transaxial slices parallel to the anterior commissure posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and including the medial and posterior temporal, frontal and occipital cortexes. A high-resolution structural volume was acquired at the end of each session with a 3D MPRAGE (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo) sequence (matrix 256 x 256; field of view 256 mm; slice thickness 1 mm; no gap; in-plane voxel size 1 x 1 mm; flip angle 12 ; TR 9. 7 ms; TE 4 ms) . fMRI paradigm The fMRI study was a block-design study. Each scanning session consisted of five runs containing five blocks of 24 s. Participants performed a face-encoding task during the first three runs, a face discrimination task during the fourth run and a face recognition task during the last run. For each of the three tasks the subjects were required to choose between two options (dual-choice) , as previously described by Haxby and colleagues in a PET study (Haxby et al. , 1996) . The dual-choice blocks ( on condition) were alternated in an off-on fashion, in which the off condition lasted 24 s and con- sisted of repeating, alternating pressing of the two buttons. Stimuli for the dual-choice tasks consisted of one upper and two lower white frames, in which either a greyscale neutral face or a non- sense pattern, according to the task type, was presented. The photos with a neutral facial expression were obtained with the consent of volunteers from our institute. During each block, six stimuli were resented for 4 s each. The stimuli for the face-encoding task were a nonsense pattern in the upper frame and an alternating face and a nonsense pattern in the lower frames: the subject was required to ress the button that corresponded to the lower frame which con- tained the face (Fig. 1A) . The stimuli for the face discrimination task were a master face pattern in the upper frame and two faces in the lower frames: the subject was required to press the button that corresponded to the lower frame that contained the matching face (Fig. 1B) . The stimuli for the face recognition task were a nonsense attern in the upper frame and two faces in the lower frames: the subject was required to press the button that corresponded to the lower frame that contained the face that had already been presented during the encoding tasks (Fig. 1C) . Subjects were asked during the tasks to always express a choice. For the control task all three frames contained the nonsense pattern and no perceptual or memory judgement were required. Stimuli were projected by means of an LCD projector and two perpendicular mirrors on a translucent glass plate placed on the back of the scanner bore. An additional mirror was attached to the head coil inside the magnet bore. This permitted the subjects to see the stimuli. The LCD projector was driven by a personal computer placed in the console room. The nonsense pattern was obtained by scrambling one face using a commercial package for picture manipulation (swirl function of Adobe Photoshop CS) . Behavioural data (correct or incorrect responses) were obtained by analysing which of the two buttons was activated (left or right index fingers) . These buttons were connected via fibre-optic cables to the same computer that produced the stimuli. Behavioural data were recorded using the Psychotoolbox of the Matlab program (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) . M. Caulo et al. Fig. | Examples of faces used as stimuli for the encoding (A) , perception (B) and recognition (C) tasks. fMRI in Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome The subject and the controls received training the day before and immediately prior to fMRI in order to ensure a correct execution of the session. Task instructions were repeated orally between runs and projected on the screen 4 s before the onset of each task block. This repetitive procedure was necessary because of the increased prob- ability that the subject would otherwise forget the instructions. fMRI data analysis Raw data were analysed using Brain Voyager 4. 9 software (Brain Innovation, The Netherlands) . Preprocessing of functional scans included motion correction and removal of linear trends from voxel time series. A 3D motion correction was performed. Prepro- cessed functional volumes of each subject were co-registered with the corresponding structural data set. Since the 2D functional and 3D structural measurements were acquired in the same session, the co-registration transformation was determined using the Siemens slice position parameters of the functional images and the position parameters of the structural volume. Structural and functional images were transformed into Talairach space coordinates (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) . The Talairach transformation was performed in two steps. In the first step the structural and functional data sets were rotated in the AC-PC plane. In the second step the extreme points of the cerebrum were specified, defining 12 subvolumes which were scaled into Talairach space using a piecewise affine and con- tinuous transformation. Functional volumes were resampled at a voxel size of 3 x 3 X 3 mm. Statistical analysis was performed individually and for the control group using the general linear model (Friston et al. , 1995) in order to reveal cortical regions showing a significantly higher BOLD signal during the three tasks with respect to the off condition. The boxcar waveform representing the task and control conditions was con- volved with an empirically founded haemodynamic response function in order to account for the haemodynamic delay (Boynton et al. , 1996) . Individual and group statistical maps were thresholded at P< 0. 0004 at the voxel 18 -2, -77, -11 18 38, 75, 7 46, 74, 10 27, -88, 6 Table 3 ANOVA results: comparison of BOLD signal percentage changes during the memory tasks for the different ROI: probabilities for post hoc test Insula Anterior Posterior MPFC IFG Anterior Posterior Fusiform DLPFC DLPFC VLPFC hippocampus hippocampus gyrus Encoding vs perception 0. 094 0. 051 0. 016* 0. 051 0. 156 0. 835 0. 034* 0. 012* Encoding vs recognition 0. 01 1* 0. 000* 0. 000* 0. 000* 0. 000* 0. 001* 0. 072 0. 000* Recognition vs perception 0. 334 0. 051 0. 229 0. 000* 0. 000* 0. 001* 0. 028* 0. 258 *Significant differences. significant interaction [F (14. 98) = 3. 49; P < 0. 0001] between the two factors was observed. In the prefrontal cortex, the BOLD signal increased during the three memory tasks (encoding, perception, and recogni- tion) (Fig. 5A) . The anterior and posterior DLPFC, the MPFC and the insular cortex were significantly more activated during recognition than during encoding. No difference was demon- strated, for the same cortical regions, between recognition and perception except for the MPFC, which was more activated during recognition (Fig. 5A and B) . Moreover, the anterior and posterior DLPFC, MPFC and insular cortex showed no significant difference between encoding and perception, except for the posterior DLPFC, which was more activated during perception. The VLPFC activation was significantly greater during recognition than during both encoding and perception (Fig. 5B) . In the MTL, the ROI that MTL is activated during episodic memory encoding and retrieval. A meta-analysis of 52 PET studies conclude that the anterior MTL is strongly associated with episodic encoding, whereas the posterior MTL is associated with retrie- val (Lepage et al. , 1998) . In contrast, Schacter and Wagner (1999) , in their meta-analysis of fMRI studies, indicate a predominance of posterior MTL activation for encoding. Data on retrieval were insufficient to draw any conclusion on rostrocaudal localization. Overall, although there is no general agreement on regional anatomical differences in activation between encoding and retrieval, several authors have reporte that MTL activation is observed during both episodic encod- ing and retrieval (Shacter et al. , 1999; Eldridge et al. , 2000; Greicius et al. , 2003) . We chose recognition memory for faces because faces are novel, unfamiliar and unique in their configuration. There- fore, they are more suitable than words for testing episodic memory (Haxby et al. , 1996) . Few {MRI studies have inves- tigated facial encoding and recognition. Kelley and colleagues reported a bilateral MTL (greater on the right) and right dorsal frontal cortex activation during encoding (Kelley et al. , 1998) . Bernard and colleagues tested memory for famous faces using an event-related fMRI study and demonstrated a functional distinction between the anterior and posterior aspects of the hippocampus, the former being involved in successful episodic encoding and the latter with retrieval of semantic information (Bernard et al. , 2004) . Haxby and colleagues, using PET, found that diencephalic lesions and fMRI indicates that anterograde memory loss is due to a failure to encode the aspects of the incoming information at the hippocampal level. These findings support the view that the distinction between diencephalic and MTL amnesias is of limited value. The common denominator of anterograde amnesia is damage to an extended hippocampal system which seems to work as a unitary network (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) .

NONVERBAL AMNESIA 141 distribution of cerebral lesions in this disease has been thought to be similar across cases, with bilateral and symmetric involvement of, eee. However, early postmortem studies fre- q ic cerebral lesions (Drachman & Adams, 1962; Hierons, Janota, & Corsellis, 1978) . In patients who survived the encephalitis and were in stable, chronic phases of recovery, it was dif- ficult to establish at that time the importance of right vs. feft lesion distribution because of the limited availability of standardized and experi- mental neuropsychological studies and informative in vivo neuroimaging studies. We describe a patient whose neuroimaging studies and profound amnesia after viral encephalitis bear upon anatomic and cognitive issues. Two aspects of her presentation brought her to special attention: (1) a remarkable asymmetry of cerebral! lesions, i > but minimal involvement of the left mesia findings support a poral lobe processing in retrograde as well as anterograde memory and indicate that herpes sim- plex encephalitis may lead to different forms of amnesia and varied pat- terns of limbic system lesions. CASE DESCRIPTION Clinical Course The patient, known as LD, was 17 years old at the time of her encepha- litis. Past medical and psychological histories were unremarkable. Her birth and development milestones were entirely normal. Throughout school she maintained average grades and graduated from high school at 17 years of age. She was described by family as quite independent and socially active, owning her own car and working as a bookkeeper/recep- tionist after graduation. While on a brief domestic vacation in 1981, she began to experience flu symptoms which steadily worsened. The next day she returned home quite weak, dizzy, and nauseous. At a local hospital, she was ini- tially diagnosed with viral meningitis and treated conservatively. Over the next few days, she became agitated, irritable, and belligerent, com- plaining of photophobia and severe headache. Upon transfer to another hospital, she was diagnosed with herpes simplex encephalitis. At this time (one week after initial symptoms) , she became less responsive and developed seizures as well as right hemiparesis. During the ensuing weeks, the patient spoke only in short sentences which were often incoherent and incomplete. She demonstrated no recog- nition of her name, personal history, circumstances, or family members. Her visual perception was noted to be very poor, as she could describe 142 ESLINGER ET AL. only the outline of objects. She appeared unable to recognize food, losing 30 pounds, and one day attempted to eat a plastic fork. Hallucinations and random, purposeless activity were frequent. She remained in the hospital for 5 months. At discharge, she ambulated normally, could speak, see and hear normally, but was unable to smell or taste. Upon arriving home, she evidenced no recognition of the house or her personal effects. She gradually came to recognize a few family members, particu- larly her mother and brother, but could not recognize her boyfriend of 3 years. She entered a rehabilitation center and received cognitive and memory retraining for 3 months. Since that time, she has received contin- uing neuropsychological studies. Neuroimaging Studies Neuroimaging studies were completed on the patient 3 years after onset of her encephalitis. Procedures included CT scan without contrast and MR scan with T, - and T, -weighted images. Anatomical analysis of these images was performed with the method of Damasio and Damasio (1989) by an investigator blinded to the identification and clinical neuropsycho- logical history of the patient. CT scan images are presented in Fig. 1, T, -weighted MR images in Fig. 2, and depiction of the lesion on our appropriate template system in Fig. 3. These images demonstrate a large, well-demarcated area of abnormal signal in the right hemisphere. lesion encompasses: (a) the temporal pole; (b) the medial temporal region, including the extent of the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus proper; (c) the anterior half of the superior temporal gyrus; and (d) all of the middle and inferior temporal gyri. The insula is also damaged as the lesion extends further rostrally and caudally. The rostral division reaches to the most anterior and inferior portions of the cingulate gyrus (part of area 24) , as well as posterior ventromedial frontal lobe including the basal forebrain and gyrus rectus. The posterior and superior divisions of the lesion extend into the inferior parietal lobule, compromising part of the supramarginal gyrus (area 40) and most of the angular gyrus (area 39) , and even into lateral occipital lobe (area 19) . In the left hemisphere there is comparatively little damage. The lesion is limited to the region of the collateral suicus, to the inferior portion of the insula, and minimally to the posterior ventromedial sector of the frontal lobe. Neuropsychological Studies We present an integrated summary of the patient s examination find- ings based on our studies as well as separate, later analysis by O Connor, NONVERBAL AMNESIA 143 # Me Fic. 1.

Speech was fluent, nonparaphasic, and well-articulated. Assessment of language with the Multilingual Aphasia Examination (Benton, 1976) re- vealed normal levels of visual naming, digit repetition, aural comprehen- sion, spelling, controlled oral word association, and writing. Reading of sentences and paragraphs from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examina- tion (Goodglass & Kaplan, 1983) was normal. Grade achievement levels (WRAT-R; Jastak & Wilkinson, 1984) in spelling and oral word reading were compatible with her academic background. Examination of visual processing indicated intact visual fields to con- frontation, visual acuity, color perception, and geometric form percep- tion. In addition, object recognition and usage were always accurate and prompt, and there was no evidence of visual neglect or extinction. How- ever, several complex visual perceptual and parietal lobe functions were impaired. Visual spatial perception, measured with the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (Benton, Hamsher, Varney, & Spreen, 1983) , was in the borderline range (9th percentile) . Prominent disturbances were evident, though, in visual pattern perception such as Benton s (1983) discrimina- tion of unfamiliar faces (4th percentile) , Mooney and Ferguson s (1951) visual closure task (70% correct: impaired) , and Hooper s (1983) task of visual synthesis (high probability of impairment) . O Connor et al. (1992) report that the patient also had some difficulty recognizing visually com- plex items of the Boston Naming Test, particularly specific members of a class (e. g. , 4-legged animals) and very low frequency items (e. g. , abacus) .

Copying simple geometric forms was intact. 3-D block construction, under highly st iti s intact (Benton et al. , 1983) . Copy of the Rey-Osterieth Comoles Pigecs (Rey, 1941; Osterrieth, 1944) was impaled (10h percent) and hastened by spatial dso and (disorganized) approach, although all elements were eventually drawn. 146 ESLINGER ET AL. Spatial orientation was very impaired in any type of geographic orienta- tion or geographic knowledge task. She could neither construct nor recog- nize the outline of the United States. She could not localize prominent cities and states, including those in her local region. Right left discrimina- tion was intact on herself, but on confrontation testing, she performed normally only if she could physically turn herself around. Tests of frontal lobe functions indicated that the patient could initiate and generate a normal range of appropriate responses in divergent pro- duction tasks such 2s verbal associative fueney (77th percentile) and (category fluency.

Later testing by onnor ef al. indicated improved performance on these tasks, suggesting that the patient has the capacity to learn from certain experiences. Overall, the patient was consistently disorganized in her approach to unstructured tasks and im- pulsive in her responses, including cognitive estimation responses. She benefited from greater structure in laboratory, personal, and work-related tasks.

She was unable to NONVERBAL AMNESIA 147 learn any spatial information, except when it could be entirely mediated in verbal terms. She follows her route to work only by memorization of specific and unchanging directions that utilize obvious and highly verbal- izable landmarks. If the route is spatially rearranged by detour, she must call home to obtain new verbal directions. She can retain the location of her car in a parking lot only by verbal markers. If she loses this informa- tion, she must visit each car to examine the license plate. She has learned locations of bathrooms and work areas strictly in verbal terms. In contrast, the patient processed and retaine at norma! to near-normal levels. This was especially true for free recall Red s. Similar patterns were evident for the Rey and Califor- nia auditory verbal learning tasks (Rey, 1964; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 1987) , where her learning curve improved across trials at an aver- age level. Despite a 36% reduction in delayed free recall, her verbal recognition memory was at a normal level and commensurate with level of learning. Verbal paired associate learning was more difficult for her, particularly learning and recall of the novel word pairs that hadino seman- tic finkage. Overall measure of verbal learni retention placed her in the low average range ieee, Later testing by O Connor et al. (1992) revealed ncoding , release fri ; levels of processing all showed a normal pattern. She also demonstrated a priming in laboratory and naturalistic settings. Motor learning, assessed through pursuit rotor and mirror-tracing pro- cedures, revealed a normal learning curve and full retention over 3 days. s probed with standardized measures of d recall of fa cumstances, but showed a significant impairment were also examined, with factual and epis: provided by her mother serving as criterion. With the exception of recog- nizing her mother and brother, her recall was composed of verbal facts that were devoid of any personal awareness or recollection of those expe- riences. Hence, while she could give the name of her grade school and high school, she could recall no specific episodes, impressions or emo- tional experiences from those years. Names of teachers and classmates were limited to those she had been retaught from her yearbooks. She thought she had been told she visited Florida and California (which she had) , but did not know why, when, or specifically where. She could neither recall nor consistently recognize any jobs prior to her illness, any 148 ESLINGER ET AL. school-related activities, or any friends. This pattern of findings has been confirmed by O'Connor et al. (1992) , who report th the patient in comparison to her brother, who is 3 years younger and of similar educational background. With the excep- tion of shreds of verbal factual knowledge (both personal and publi do- mains) , the patient has been unable to generate specific information ema- nating from eithe DISCUSSION LD s neurologic presentation and course were as expected for herpes simplex encephalitis. After initial flu-like symptoms, there was pro- gressive obtundation, seizures, and unresponsiveness. Her neuroimaging studies were also characteristic, revealing limbic system damage, al- though in a strikingly asymmetric manner.

She has come to recognize family members and a few items from sandardizedtess of public events and facesprio fo onset of her illness but her accuracy remains w elow normal. While she can offer verbal descriptions that structure her past (such as birthplace, schools, family pets) , these facts appear to be isolated from any broader knowledge base that permit She particularly, s) and frequently explains that she knows of her past only from what she has been told. Unlike the postencephalitic patient Boswell (Damasio er al. , 1985) , who demonstrates a more exten- sive retrograde amnesia and sustained large, bilateral limbic system le- sions, this patient has been able to retain parts of her personal history and public event knowledge (supplemental by intensive rehabilitation) . However, this knowledge appears to be available to her only as verbal facts. Considering the highly asymmetric pattern of cerebral damage, the findings would suggest that t ossibly in combina- tion with critical neural substrate for NONVERBAL AMNESIA 149 he highly limited damage to the left temporal re- gion, actually sparing the hippocampus, amygdala and most of the para- hippocampal gyrus, could not adequately account for this extensive im- pairment, although some contribution may be possible. Furthermore, this pattern of damage clearly affected not only past visual nonverbal experi- ences and knowledge, but also specific verbal linkages in the domain of personal and public events knowledge, although to a lesser extent. This raises the possibility of some degree of critic In many other domains o} the patient appears to be unaffected.

Her retrograde memory is most accurate when or instance, while she recognizes the generic Class of dogs, ails to recognize her dog of many years as well as his particular breed. This requires retrieval of varying degrees of unique features that differentiate among members of a category. such as different animals whose shapes are ambiguous (see Damasio, 1990; Damasio, Damasio, Tranel, & Brandt, 1990) . Thus, her retrograde amne- sia encompasses not onl (Tulving, 1983) , but also n this regard, the pa- n that associated with medial and polar temporal lobe damage. It is possible that the additional lesion to and possibly i led to this more extensive retreival impairment in th Anterograde Learning and Memory A strong dissociation was evident between nonverbal and verbal learn- ing. Prior studies of right medial temporal lobe surgery for intractable epilepsy have documente: a. Kimura, 1963; Milner, ; Smitl ilner, . The pa- s defect in this area is especially severe and appears to be related to destruction of the entire right medial temporal region. On a daily ba- sis, she is completely unable to learn and retain new nonverbal informa- tion, despite offering accurate descriptions of her immediate environ- men. New vera novledge, however, conten evden and ex i i- safely in city traffic, the patient requires thorough verbal mediation of landmarks and directions in order to reach her destination. Similar to her 150 ESLINGER ET AL. retrograde memory impairment of nonverbal learning, despite its severity, has not precluded some aspects of learning. In spite of her inability to recognize new faces consciously (e. g. , her examiners) , the patient has generated consistent and significantly larger skin conductance responses to certain new faces (Tranel & Damasio, 1985) . The results indicate that . However, thi Anatomic Comparisons The pattern of cerebral damage in the patient contrasts markedly with that seen in the postencephalitic patients Boswell (Damasio et al. , 1985) and SS (Eslinger & Cermak, 1988) . The latter two patients suffered more extensive and symmetric limbic system lesions and more pervasive am- nesia, particularly in the anterograde sphere. Although this pattern is considered typical of herpes simplex encephalitis, previous postmortem studies have described highly asymmetric lesions in 12 of 19 cases (Hay- maker, 1949; Drachman & Adams, 1962; Hierons er al. , 1978) . Recent report of in vivo neuroimaging in a series of postencephalitic patients also found a high frequency of asymmetric limbic system lesions (Eslinger, Alexander, Cermak & Grattan, 1990) . Establishing the anatomic details of viral encephalitic lesions provides neurobiologic data that are critical to understanding amnesia and the neu- ral substrate of memory. As the results of this study illustrate, the ana- tomic and cognitive sequelae of herpes simplex encephalitis may vary dramatically, and patients with this diagnosis cannot be assumed to have homogenous syndromes. As an example, Warrington and McCarth 1988) described a postencephalitic patient who report, the patient s cerebral lesion was highly asymmetric, with much greater involvement of the right than the left temporal lobe. However, the possible implications of this anatomic asymmetry favoring the left temporal lobe was not considered in analysis of the cognitive dissocia- tions. Although the specific tasks varied in our patient, she, too, showed sparing of left temporal lobe structures show a ae a Patient Boswell _ s he ae = ci ontrast, suffered extensive damage to both temporal lobes and does not show any benefit from verbal cues in tasks of past facial and event NONVERBAL AMNESIA 151 recognition. The occasional famous name that he can recognize or gener- ate from first name and surname cues surfaces without regard to accom- panying facial pictures or context, suggesting that they represent simply over learned verbal associations. Therefore, the particular characteristics of amnesia may not be generalizable from diagnostic information alone, but rather require correlation to neuroanatomic data. In conclusion, the findings in this case indicate that different profiles of amnesia can result from herpes simplex encephalitis and that powerful refore, it s critical anatomic results of individual cases.

Picardi Severe amnesia following bilateral medial temporal lobe damage occurring on two distinct occasions Received: 27 November 2005 / Accepted in revised form: 22 March 2006 Abstract A comprehensive neuropsychological assess- ment was performed on a 38-year-old woman with drug- resistant right temporal lobe epilepsy before temporal lobectomy, during a 2-year follow-up period, and approxi- mately 3 years after surgery when she developed a malig- nant glioma in the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) . Both before and after epilepsy surgery, memory function was normal. When the tumour was discovered, the patient suf- fered from severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia, whereas working memory and the other cognitive abilities were preserved. Compared with other cases of bilateral temporal lesion, this case is peculiar because the damage occurred on two distinct occasions. It suggests that only one MTL can allow normal memory function, or can take over the function normally subserved by a dysfunctional contralateral MTL when the dysfunction is marked and prolonged, such as in chronic epilepsy.

Esposito Department of Neurosurgery La Sapienza University of Rome, Italy A. Picardi Center of Epidemiology and Health Surveillance and Promotion Italian National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy Introduction Global amnesia is characterised by a severe loss of memory with relatively preserved cognitive abilities. It has been asso- ciated with selective damage to several brain regions, includ- ing the hippocampus, the mammillar bodies, the dorsal medi- al nucleus of the thalamus, the fornix and the pathways con- necting them [1, 2]. Among the structures involved in this cir- cuit, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been most frequent- ly reported as bilaterally damaged in patients with global amnesia [3]. In almost all these patients the damage occurred on a single occasion, and it was due to various factors such as viral infections, anoxia, ischaemia, head injuries, surgery, etc. In this paper, we report the case of a young woman who underwent a right temporal lobectomy for medically refracto- ry temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with an excellent seizure and neuropsychological outcome, who approximately 3 years later presented with a neoplastic lesion involving primarily the left MTL structures and rapidly developed severe global amnesia. Due to its peculiarities, this case might also contribute to shed light on the issue of the possible contralateral reorgani- sation of memory processes subserved by the MTL struc- tures chronically involved in epileptogenesis. Although the left and right MTLs are primarily involved in processing dif- ferent types of material-specific information (i. e. , verbal and visuospatial) , their functions are at least partially bilaterally distributed, and they may present an ipsilateral or contralat- eral reorganisation [4]. While the literature on epilepsy surgery shows that patients undergoing surgical removal of one MTL can live without substantial memory impairment, less is known about how memory systems reorganise over the course of the illness and after surgery. Case report Mrs. M. V. was a right-handed, 38-year-old female who was referred to our Epilepsy Surgery Unit for medically refrac- 130 G. Di Gennaro et al. : Amnesia following bilateral medial temporal lobe damage tory partial seizures occurring since age 18. She was the product of an uncomplicated full-term pregnancy and delivery. She had no history of other medical illnesses including CNS infections, febrile convulsions or head injuries. The family history was negative for seizure disor- ders and other neurological or psychiatric diseases. At 18 years of age, she began to notice brief paroxys- mal episodes characterised by psycho-experiential symp- toms (derealisation, depersonalisation, d ja vu) followed by rising epigastric sensation, fear, tachycardia and then behavioural arrest with loss of consciousness, oro-alimen- tary and right gestual automatisms. These episodes occurred weekly, lasted 1-2 min, and were followed by postictal confusion without apparent dysphasia. Many courses of various antiepileptic drugs were tried, without substantial improvement. At the age of 38 the patient underwent a comprehensive presurgical protocol including neuropsychological and psy- chiatric assessment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and video-EEG monitoring. Details about this protocol have been reported elsewhere [5]. The neuropsychological battery included several memory tests exploring verbal and visuospatial memory [6], as well as the WAIS-R, the Trail Making A and B, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy, the Benton Judgement of Line Orientation (Form H) and Raven s Coloured Progressive Matrices. At admission, the neurological examination was unre- markable. Neuropsychological testing revealed a normal Table 1 Scores on neuropsychological tests over time IQ and no detectable cognitive deficits, as summarised in Table 1. A brain MRI (1. 5-T Magnet) showed a small lesion in the right anterior mid-basal neocortical (T4 gyrus) temporal region (about 3 cm from the pole) compatible with a cavernous angioma. Video-EEG monitoring (Telefactor Corp, W. Conshohocken, PA) revealed irregular theta slowing and frequent spikes in the right anterior tem- poral regions. During the complex partial seizures record- ed, the EEG showed a brief right anterotemporal focal flat- tening followed by 7 Hz rhythmic theta intermixed with a 2. 5 Hz delta activity over the right temporal regions spreading over the ipsilateral suprasylvian regions. Based on anatomo-electro-clinical correlations, right TLE was diagnosed, with a likely early involvement of MTL struc- tures in epileptic discharge. Consequently, a right lesionec- tomy plus corticectomy including MTL structures was offered and performed. Pathological examination of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous angioma. Regular follow-up visits were carried out 1, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Given that no seizures or auras were reported, after the third visit medication was gradually dis- continued, with no subsequent seizure recurrences. The neuropsychological assessment was repeated 12 and 24 months after surgery and showed no substantial modifica- tions, as reported in Table 1. About 3 years after the intervention, she came again to our attention complaining of depression and continuously worsening memory difficulties.

Di Gennaro et al. : Amnesia following bilateral medial temporal lobe damage 131 revealed very severe retrograde amnesia, with a lack of memory for public events, famous people and autobio- graphic information extending for decades. She was unable to recognise her neurologist, who had treated her for many years, and she was even unaware that she had suffered from epilepsy and had been surgically treated. Also, she did not remember why she had just been hospitalised. While the patient was able to recall the names of her two children, she was unaware of being married and did not know her hus- band s name. Nevertheless, she knew her date of birth and was able to recall some events that occurred in infancy and adolescence. Aside from the very severe memory distur- bance, her neurological examination was unremarkable. In order to reduce the patient s burden, the neuropsychological evaluation was slightly shortened as compared with previ- ous assessments. Intellectual abilities were assessed with Raven s Coloured Progressive Matrices only, while lan- guage (i. e. , naming and comprehension) was not specifical- ly tested as the clinical examination revealed no substantial impairment. As summarised in Table 1, the neuropsycho- logical evaluation showed a severe impairment of long-term memory for both visuospatial and verbal information (e. g. , Fig. 1) . On the contrary, working memory and attention were not compromised, and the sensory-motor, intellectual, perceptual abilities and constructive praxes were also well preserved. tered a task. For this reason, tests of recognition memory were deemed unnecessary and were not carried out. Apart from findings related to previous right temporal lobectomy, brain MRI revealed a contrast-enhanced mass lesion involving the left hippocampus and parahippocam- pal gyrus, sparing their anterior portion (Fig. 2) . Given that severe amnesia was already present and that there was a high risk of uncal herniation, the patient was offered surgery. Both she and her family gave their written informed consent to perform a left temporal lesionectomy. Pathological examination of the excised tissue showed a high-grade glioblastoma. After surgery, the patient became mildly hypersexual with a slight worsening of her amnesia confirmed by a fur- ther neuropsychological evaluation performed 1 month after the operation (Table 1) .

Di Gennaro et al. : Amnesia following bilateral medial temporal lobe damage showed the complete surgical removal of the left temporal lesion with disappearance of perilesional oedema. The patient survived for a further 13 months, during which she received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Discussion Global amnestic syndrome is not rare, and it is well known that working memory is spared in patients with bilateral MTL lesions. However, this case is peculiar because the damage to right and left MTL structures occurred on two separate occasions. First, right temporal lobectomy was performed for intractable epilepsy, then three years later a malignant brain tumour damaged the left hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortex. This unfolding of events over time made it possible for us to document optimal memory function following unilateral MTL damage. This suggests that only one MTL can allow normal memory function, or can take over the function normally subserved by a dys- functional contralateral MTL when this dysfunction is marked and prolonged, such as in chronic TLE. Several cases of amnesia in conjunction with bilateral hippocampal damage have been reported and recently reviewed [3]. Our finding of retrograde and anterograde memory deficits with relatively spared cognitive abilities is consistent with previous observations on patients with bilateral lesions involving the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal gyrus, with varying degrees of involvement of the extramedial temporal cortex. Although we serially performed a comprehensive neuropsychologi- cal assessment, we cannot solve the many controversies that still exist regarding hippocampal amnesia, such as the effect of lesion size, and the nature and degree of the anterograde and retrograde memory impairment. It is largely accepted that when the left hemisphere is dominant, the left and right MTL systems are involved in the processing of different types of material-specific informa- tion. In fact, verbal and visuospatial memory deficits may be observed after surgery in the left and the right hemisphere, respectively, although deficits in visuospatial memory are often difficult to bring to light. However, in spite of this putative specialisation, the finding that left hemispheric patients tend to suffer combined non-verbal and verbal prob- lems more often than right hemispheric patients [7] suggests that the left MTL plays a particularly important role in mem- ory function. This putative dominant role of the left MTL might help explain why our patient continued to show opti- mal memory function after the first operation. Given that memory function was basically intact after right temporal lobectomy and that it declined rapidly to the degree of severe amnesia during the growth of a left MTL tumour three years later, either a contralateral memory reorganisation or an atypical memory lateralisation preceding the onset of epilep- sy can be invoked as possible explanations. While it is not possible for us to rule out either of these explanations, we believe that the first one is more likely, because epilepsy dated back at least 20 years and the right MTL function had probably been so compromised by the frequent ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges as to promote contralateral memory reorganisation. In contrast to language function, plasticity and reorgan- isation of memory function in epilepsy have been less well investigated. Nevertheless, some findings suggest that memory reorganisation in the contralateral MTL can actu- ally occur. For instance, differences in verbal memory deficits after left anterior temporal lobectomy in patients with early and late onset of epilepsy suggest a relationship between early onset of epilepsy and reorganisation of memory functions [4]. The findings of a recent {MRI study also suggest memory reorganisation in the contralateral temporal lobe. In this study [8], patients with left TLE showed greater verbal encoding activation in the right MTL, whereas those with right TLE showed greater non- verbal encoding activation in the left MTL. Moreover, another study suggested that MTL structures, being philo- genetically older, provide less material-specific functions, which tend to be bilaterally distributed, as compared with neocortical lateral structures [9]. While future work will be necessary to address the many issues that this paper has left open, our case report, due to its peculiarities, might contribute to increase the understanding of memory system reorganisation processes over the course of epilepsy. Sommario L argomento della riorganizzazione delle fun- zioni mnesiche nelle strutture temporo-mesiali controlate- rali al focolaio epilettogeno & ancora controverso. Riportiamo il caso di una donna di 38 anni affetta da epi- lessia temporale destra sintomatica di angioma cavernoso, sottoposta a valutazione neuropsicologica prima dell ese- cuzione dell intervento neurochirurgico di lobectomia tem- porale destra, durante un periodo di follow-up di circa due anni e circa 3 anni dopo la chirurgia, quando sviluppava un glioma maligno a carico delle strutture temporali di sinistra. Al momento della valutazione prechirurgica relati- va al primo intervento e nei successivi due anni di follow- up le funzioni mnesiche della paziente risultavano normali. Alla diagnosi del tumore temporale sinistro, la paziente presen- tava una amnesia retro-anterograda severa, mentre la memoria di lavoro e le restanti funzioni cognitive erano normali. Rispetto ai casi di lesioni bilaterali a carico delle strutture temporali, il caso da noi riportato appare pecu- liare, in quanto il danno si verificato in due distinte occa- sioni. I dati neuropsicologici suggeriscono che le strutture temporo-mesiali di un unico emisfero possono consentire un funzionamento mnesico normale oppure che le funzioni mnesiche sottese da strutture temporo-mesiali coinvolte nel focolaio epilettogeno possono riorganizzarsi nelle omolo- G.

MARKOWITSCH and HERBERT ENGEL Department of Neurology, Kamillus-Clinic, Asbach, Germany Physiological Psychology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany (Received 2 April 1997) The case of a patient suffering from rupture of an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery is reported. The hematoma was located in the basal forebrain, one of the anatomical regions associated with mnestic functions. Memory and other cognitive functions were studied. The patient performed well on all non-mnestic tests, but showed significant memory impairment. Anterograde memory was deficient not only in recall, but also in recognition. Performance on remote memory showed some differentiation. The patient remembered autobiographical material and famous faces correctly. but presented deficits on a Famous Events Test. This dissociation represents a difference in emotional content or familiarity of the material; the performance in tests using material with a higher emotional content was unremarkable. Lesions within the basal forebrain seem to deteriorate anterograde and remote memory, but performance may be inconspicuous if test material of high emotional content or familiarity is used. Keywords: Memory; remote memory basal forebrain Aside from medial parts of the temporal lobes and medial structures of the dien- cephalon the basal forebrain Irle et al. , 1992; Parkin, Leng, Stanhope, & Smith, 1988; Volpe & Hirst, 1983) . Several reports demonstrated major disparities between patients and controls on free recall as opposed to recognition tasks, Accounts on remote memory performance in general and especially following rupture of the ACoA are infrequent ( . g. , DeLuca & Diamond, 1995; Kapur, 1993) . Alexander and Freedman (1984) found an impairment in retrograde memory func- tions in 7 of 11 patients measured by an interview. Poor recall of biographical facts and family information was shown by Damasio et al. (1985) for one of their patients. Parkin and Leng (1993) reported only mild impairment in a Famous Faces Test for one of their three patients, whereas Damasio et al. (1985) sketched significant deficits in spontaneous recall of famous faces for two ACoA-patients. Finally, recall and recognition of public events in ACoA patients were described by Gade and Mortensen (1990) ; the authors found impaired recall and recognition performance for all decades and a flat temporal gradient with an advantage for the earlier decades. To our knowledge, detailed studies using several tests for remote memory after ruptured ACoA aneurysm are not available. In the following we report extensive data on remote and anterograde memory in an ACoA patient and try to enlarge the knowledge about (retrograde) mnestic functions and the basal forebrain (cf. DeLuca & Diamond, 1995) , CASE REPORT AND METHODS P. E. , a 36-year-old, right-handed, male locksmith (in steel construction) was admitted to our hospital four weeks after an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) . Never having had any prior warning symptoms, P. E. acutely developed an BASAL FOREBRAIN & MEMORY 267 intense headache and became unconscious. The degree of severity of the SAH with respect to the operative risk was classified as grade V at onset (scale of Hunt & Hess, 1968) , Cranial CT scanning showed a large bilateral hematoma in the base of the frontal lobe with rupture into the ventricular system (Fig. 1) . Medial structures of the basal forebrain (including the septal/diagonal band complex) as well as parts of the orbital cortex were damaged. As cause of the bleeding, an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery was found by arteriography. After primary treatment by external ventricular shunt, P. E. reached grade IV (after Hess FIGURE | Cranial CT-scans showing the bilateral hematoma in the basal forebrain after ACoA rupture in patient P. E. 268 R. BABINSKY et al. and Hunt) and was surgically treated 5 days later by aneurysm clipping. The development of an nonresorptive communicating hydrocephalus made ventricu- loatrial shunting necessary three weeks after SAH. Further clinical progress was uncomplicated. Confusion and lack of insight largely disappeared within several days. At the time of admission to our hospital P. E, showed no focal neurologic deficits. Six weeks after SAH we started neuropsychological testing. Non-mnestic functions were tested by the following instruments: Intelligence. reduced German Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WIP: Dahl. 1986) : Cognitive reasoning. Wisconson Card Sorting Test (WCST, ; Nelson, 1976) , Concept Comprehension Task of Cronin-Golomb (1986) , Go/NoGo-Task (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1993) : Basic language functions. Token Test (Orgass, 1982) , the Naming Task of a German Aphasia Test (Huber et al. , 1983) : Attention and information processing. Trail Making Test (Spreen & Strauss, 1991) , Concentration Endurance Test (Test d2; cf. Spreen & Strauss, 1991) , visual reaction time (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1993) ; Mood disturbances. depression scale DS (von Zerssen, 1976) . Memory functions were determined by the following tests: Anterograde memory. Wechsler Memory Scale-revised (WMS-R; Wechsler, 1987) , Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure (Spreen & Strauss, 1991) , Benton-Test (recognition; Benton, 1986) , Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT; Spreen & Strauss, 1991) , a word stem-completion task and Corsi span (Schellig & Hattig, 1993) . Remote memory. Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI; Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1989; performance controlled by P. E. s wife) , Famous Events Test 1971-1992 (recognition task, 10 items/5 years; Leplow, Blunck, Schulze, & Ferstl, 1993) , Famous Faces Test 1966-1992 (spontaneous recognition and first name cueing, 15 items/10 years: unpublished) . The two latter tests differentiate verbal and visual world knowledge. Due to the independent test development, time scales are different (5 year- vs 10 year-units) without consequences for the interpretation. To reduce inconsistent results related to childhood memories below the age of about 12 years the time periods have to be chosen carefully. Since P. E. was born in 1957, we therefore started with items around 1969. Because of the different adjustment of the two tests, we started with the Famous Events items in 1971; to avoid empty years we decided to use Famous Faces items starting in 1966 (instead of 1976) . BASAL FOREBRAIN & MEMORY 269 RESULTS The patient's behavior during the examination was unremarkable and appropriate; he was motivated and interested in participation. We found no remaining evidence for confabulation, confusion or lack of insight. He had developed a complete amnesia for the time between the SAH and the first days after his awakening. As shown in Table I, the results for the non-mnestic tests of the neuropsycho- logical examination were within normal limits, with some variable results in attention. The deficient anterograde memory functions are summarized in Table II. Remote memory functions showed a dissociation between different tests. The patient presented undisturbed semantic and episodic autobiographical remembrance on the AMI (personal semantic memory score: 63 of 63 points; autobiographical incidents score: 25 of 27 points) . The results of the Famous Faces Test (spontaneous + cued recognition) and the Famous Events Test (recog- mtion) are shown in Figure 2. To compare the results of the control group (n = 9; M =35 years [SD = 1. 3]; FSIQ: M = 113 [SEM = 8. 6]) and P. E. , we calculated the confidence intervals of the group means (Bortz, 1979) , Results of P. E. in the Famous Events Test (1971-85) differed significantly from controls. His results in the third time period of the famous events (from 1986 onwards) and for all time periods of the famous faces were unremarkable. DISCUSSION Our patient showed no signs of intellectual deterioration, severe cognitive frontal lobe dysfunctions, attention, language. or mood disturbances. P. E. presented the expected anterograde amnesia, but we did not find a clear dissociation between deficient recall and undisturbed recognition in anterograde memory functions often described after frontal lobe damage (Hanley, Davies, Downes, & Mayes, 1995; Janowsky, Shimamura, Kritchevsky, & Squire, 1989; Jetter, Poser, TABLE Non-mnestic cognitive functions in patient P.

Heubrock, 1992) Freeman, & Markowitsch, 1986; Moscovitch, 1989; Parkin et al. , 1988; Volpe & Hirst, 1983) . Because disturbances in cognition were mostly related to the initial impact of the SAH, the late operation in our patient would be without effect (Sonesson, Ljunggren, Saveland, & Brandt, 1987) . Reports on deficient recognition can be found in several studies (e. g. , Lindquist & Norlen, 1966; Parkin, Yeoman, & Bindschaedler, 1994; Stuss et al. , 1994; Vilkki, 1985; von Cramon, Markowitsch, & Schuri, 1993) . Usually, deficits in recognition were less severe than in free recall. Parkin et al. (1994) reported the case of a patient who performed below average when presenting single items of the recognition list, but showed normal performance when presenting items simultaneously. The authors suggest that simultaneous presentation may allow direct control of the familarity of an item and could help to exclude distractors. In case of single presentation, the recognition process may include a free recall strategy in which the item in question is compared with context information. Similar to the patient of Parkin et al. (1994) , P. E. had problems with the single item recognition trial of the AVLT; especially, his rates of wrong classifications and false positives were definitely below average. Under these conditions, item- familiarity does not improve remembrance. Additionally, about 86% of P. E. s false positive answers showed semantic similarity with the original words, whereas phonemic mistakes were rare. One explanation may be the higher familiarity of semantically similar distractors, which makes (false positive) recognition more probable.

BABINSRY etal. In the domain of remote memory, P. E. performed below average for the two earlier time-periods in the recognition of famous events. Results for the most recent famous events, the famous faces and the Autobiographical Memory Interview appeared undisturbed. Published results on remote memory testing of patients with lesions of the basal forebrain are inconsistent, perhaps depending on anatomical variability or differ- ent tests used. Parkin and Leng (1993) , for instance, used a Famous Faces Test and reported mild remote memory deficits for only one of their three patients, but Alexander and Freedman (1984) using an interview technique, found retrograde memory impairments for seven of their eleven patients. A recent study reported the retrograde memory functions of the 61-year-old female patient H. 1. (von Cramon et al. , 1993) , who suffered a brain infarct in the vascular territory of the anterior perforating branches arising from the ACoA and from the left recurrent artery of Heubner. The principal lesion was located in the basal forebrain, mainly affecting the septal nuclei bilaterally. As stated by the authors, some other structures might also have been affected (e. g. , the left nucleus accumbens and the inferior thalamic peduncle) . The patient's intelligence was above-average, but anterograde memory functions were impaired. Three remote memory tests were applied. Seven months post-onset her performance in the Autobiographical Memory Interview. a Famous Faces Test and the recognition- condition of a Famous Events Test were within normal limits, whereas the scores for the free recall-condition of the Famous Events Test were definitely below average (there was no temporal gradient; cf. Table VI of von Cramon et al. , 1993) . The authors explained these results by the difference in the emotional significance of the test items used. Gade and Mortensen (1990) reported data from 20 patients after surgery for ACoA aneurysms. A rating for anterograde amnesia showed significantly lower scores for patients than for normal controls. In a Public Events Test patients per- formed worse than controls under both recall and recognition conditions, mani- festing significant differences for almost all time periods. There was a flat temporal gradient for recall and recognition, indicating poorer performance for the most recent time periods. Damage of the basal forebrain may lead to remote memory impairments. Patient H. I. with a forebrain lesion involving the septal/diagonal band area (von Cramon et al. , 1993) and our patient P-E. shared some common features: a) basal forebrain lesions. b) no frontal lobe signs, c) anterograde memory deficits, d) at least average intelligence. Focusing on remote memory, both patients showed no deficits on autobiographical memory and no deficit in recognizing famous faces. In contrast to the data of Gade and Mortensen (1990) , our patient showed better performance for the most recent years in the Famous Events Test. BASAL FOREBRAIN & MEMORY 273 The bilateral lesion after ruptured ACoA in patient P. E. caused a significant remote memory deficit for verbal world knowledge. Following the hypothesis of von Cramon et al. (1993) , emotional significance stabilizes memories. The per- formance of our patient underscores this explanation: We found unremarkable results in autobiographical memory (as confirmed by P. E. s wife) and the Famous Faces Test, but deficient results in the earlier time-periods of the famous events. The better performance could be explained by the higher emotional significance and the higher content of overlearned information or familiarity of these materi- als (von Cramon et al. , 1993) . Emotional content of someone s own biography is indoubtedly high. Similarly, the familiarity of faces is higher than that of verbal material (McCarthy & Warrington, 1990) .

BABINSKY et al. diagonal band of Broca, and the substantia innominata all are relevant memory processing structures (Bauer, Tobias, & Valenstein, 1993; Crosson, 1992) . Damage to them is observed in some neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer s dementia or Korsakoff s syndrome, in which neurons of the basal nucleus of Meynert of the substantia innominata are involved early (Arendt, Bigl, Arendt, & Tennstedt, 1983; Butters, 1985; Whitehouse et al. , 1982) . As these illnesses are not focal, but show involvement of other cortical and subcortical areas, they do not allow any statement on the specific role of the basal forebrain. Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) caused by the rupture of aneurysms located in the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) usually lead to hema- tomas in the base of the frontal lobe. Ruptured ACoA aneurysms lead to severe and enduring long-term memory deficits (e, g. , Corkin, Cohen, Sullivan, Clegg, & Rosen, 1985; Crosson, 1992; Damasio, Graff-Radford, Eslinger, Damasio, & Kassell, 1985; DeLuca & Diamond 1995; by basal forebrain damage, that is, by lesions of the basolateral limbic loop (von Cramon & Hebel, | 989) . The results suggest that the emotional content/familiarity of material to be remembered had effects on anterograde and retrograde mnestic functioning. We assume the existence of a memory network which comprises the expanded limbic system. Particularly, damage to the bottleneck structures (Markowitsch, 1995) of the medial diencephalic and basal forebrain regions may affect retrograde mem- ory performance. References Alexander, J.

The patient presented to us after an anoxic brain injury with aproverbia. Interestingly, the aproverbia appeared to be premorbid to the presenting event.

This case highlights the need, importance, and interest in further neuropsychologic, imaging and functional studies of proverb and interpretation in patients and normal subjects populations. The interpretation of proverbs and metaphors can be used to evaluate higher-level cognitive processes in patients with dif- fering levels of brain injuries. Yang, Fuller, Khodaparast, and Krawczyk (2010, p. 1923) note, The ability to engage in abstract thought is to detect a higher order meaning in lan- guage and judge this meaning to be more informative than a narrow literal interpretation. One component of the quest to unlock the human brain is to pinpoint which cortical areas allow adults to understand metaphoric language via higher- level cognitive processing. Investigators have attempted to tease out answers by comparing acquired deficits in under- standing metaphoric language with brain lesion locations. Weiner and Gardener (1977) concluded that both hemispheres contributed to metaphoric competence in separate ways/ modalities.

They used different metaphor subtypes and phrased the foil answers in systematic ways that allowed information to be gleaned from each incorrect answer regarding the patient s thought process. Three metaphor types in nominal-entity, nominal-event, and predicate form and targeted/defined foils (incorrect answers) were used to identify metaphor-specific deficits in different lexical regions (Table 2) . The three patients presented in this study were drawn from a larger ongoing group study of metaphor comprehension. Of the three patients studied, one patient (444DX) was found to have general sentence comprehension deficit, a second patient (384BX) had a differential metaphor deficit, as did the third patient (642KM) . This patient demonstrated a selective metaphor deficit while displaying normal literal com- prehension. Interestingly, patient 642KM was also not aware of his comprehension problems and felt that he understood ninety percent of what | was reading (lanni et al. , 2014) . Patient 384BX demonstrated how the new test could decipher specific metaphor deficits. That the errors were predominantly foil 1 pointed toward literal bias in interpretation. The two patients that demonstrated disproportionate metaphor defi- cits (384BX and 642KM) had unilateral left hemisphere lesions. While only three patients were studied, the findings are incon- sistent with the previous hypothesis emphasizing RHD in metaphor comprehension difficulties. Case report We describe a 40-year-old patient we were called to see 12 days after an anoxic brain injury that was secondary to an extensive medical history and hospital course. Given this his- tory, the physical examination of the patient was surprisingly intact: The patient was pleasant, awake, alert, engaging, and comfortable. Tone was normal with full range of motion in all limbs. Cranial nerves were intact. Strength was full (5/5) in the upper limbs bilaterally and 3/5 in the lower limbs bilaterally, thought likely caused by deconditioning secondary to exten- sive course of recovery. Light touch and temperature sensa- tions were intact. Muscle stretch reflexes were hyporeflexia bilaterally with an upgoing plantar reflex on the left. Cerebellar exam revealed left dysmetria on the finger-to nose-to finger test. The patient had appropriate affect, awake, and alert to self only. He showed poor to no short- term memory with 0/3 recall and very limited ability to remember physicians who had seen him previously or prior discussions, but good retrograde memory, for example, of his childhood and medical conditions these as verified by dis- cussion with family. Speech, reading, and writing were normal. The patient did not have left/right confusion or finger agnosia. The patient could solve simple one-digit arithmetic pro- blems in his head and wrote down multiplication tables through 12 x 12 correctly. The patient solved a complex word problem (two/three-digit) involving cost of objects and change correctly without needing to use pen and paper. The patient's conversational speed and _ skills, expressive and receptive, were entirely normal and at a level at least as high as to be expected from his educational level high school through eleventh grade. The patient did not have any visual deficits or hemispatial neglect. So aside from absent short-term memory, the patient seemed mostly intact neurologically. The patient even suc- cessfully demonstrated a (simple) card trick he said he had invented and we saw some drawing and sketches he had made of symbols, e. g. , for a spade, heart and diamond, and people. MRI performed one week after the anoxic brain injury was unremarkable except for bilateral symmetric restricted diffusion in the lateral aspect of the hippocampi which were hyperintense on diffusion weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure 1) and a large left cerebellar lesion (not shown) . In talking to the patient, there was one more particularly striking finding: literal interpretation of metaphors. When asked to interpret the phrase the early bird catches the worm, the patient said, when you are fishing if you want to catch something you have to start early. When asked to interpret people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, the patient made reference to the Flintstones cartoon. The patient gave literal explanations for proverbial phrases. The patient was capable of abstract thought and problem solving involving both real and hypothetical situations, but his solutions were always quite concrete: When asked, What would you do if there was a fire? the patient stated that he would go into the bathroom because that s where all the water is. When asked, What would you do if you were hungry? the patient stated he would drink some water and check my watch to see Downloaded by [Flinders University of South Australia] at 03: 41 04 February 2016 NEUROCASE @) 3 Figure 1.

This peaked our interest to further evaluate the patient's abstract cognition. Methods Proverbs We tested the patient more extensively on proverbs using the set of eight proverbs studied by Murphy et al. (2013 (Table 3) : We read a proverb to the patient and asked him to interpret what that sentence meant to him. We tested the set of eight proverbs twice the second time two days after the first. The patient was then graded based on the scoring criteria by Murphy et al. (Table 1) . Metaphors We appreciated receiving a list of metaphoric and literal state- ments with correct answers and three foils from E. Cardillo and A. Chatterjee (personal communication) used in their study (lanni et al. , 2014) . We tested the patient on 18 statements nine metaphors and nine literals. We used three metaphor and literal statements from each of the three categories of state- ments in lanni et al. : nominative entity, nominative event, and predicate statements. The task was for the patient to read the statement and select one of the four answers that best explained the statement. The four choices consisted of the target answer and three foils (Table 2, example questions and answers in Table 5) . The order of statements was randomized with regard to metaphor or literal and among the three cate- gories. The order of answers (target, foils 1-3) was randomized for each question. Our patient's score (number of target answers chosen) was tallied and compared to the normative control data of lanni et al. Also, our patient s score was com- pared to chance using a Bernoulli trial model with p = 0. 25, q = 0. 75 (four choices on each question with one correct answer) . Results On the PIT, our patient scored just 25% on his first attempt and only 6. 25% on his second attempt (Table 3) . (When tested the second time, the patient did not remember prior testing. ) The patient marked the target answer on six out of the nine metaphoric statements and six of the nine literal statements (Table 4, example questions, and answers in Table 5) .

Discussion We present the case of a patient with bilateral symmetric restricted diffusion in the hippocampi as a result of ischemia due to a less than week-old event age inferred from hyper- intense lesions on diffusion weighted sequence but with a hypointense apparent diffusion coefficient. The patient showed no significant neurological deficits besides anterograde amnesia (and left cerebellar lesion-associated deficits) , save for a very interesting focal deficit in proverb interpretation with a much less pronounced deficit in metaphor interpretation. In the fine-grained analysis of the proverb interpretation study done by Murphy et al. (2013) , the control group per- formed at 66. 7% (SD = 15. 6) , the right frontal-lateral brain injury group performed at 59% (SD = 24. 02, p = 0. 154) , the left frontal-lateral brain injury group performed at 56% (SD = 23. 27, p = 0. 195) , and the medial-frontal brain injury group performed at 48. 53% (SD = 16. 76, p = 0. 001) (Murphy et al. , 2013) . The left frontal brain injury group was significantly impaired in testing, with the medial subgroup performing significantly worse than the lateral subgroups. Our patient performed at 25% and 6. 25%, profoundly lower than all con- trol and brain-injured groups. We then compared our patient's scores to the various groups and patients from the lanni et al. (2014) study of metaphors. The control patients performed at 96. 8% accuracy in literal sentence interpretation (SD = 1. 98) and 93. 5% in metaphor interpretation (SD = 4. 65) . Foil 1 was the most commonly chosen error in metaphor condition (66. 7%) as well as literal condition (78. 3%, lanni et al. 2014) . Our patient performed at a lower capability than the control group regard- ing both metaphor and literal interpretation, which might point toward a more general comprehension deficit in this patient if solely looking at the data. However, during testing, our patient performed significantly above chance on meta- phor and literal interpretation. Indeed, using a Bernoulli trial model by random chance, only 2. 25 correct answers would be expected for nine questions (SD = 1. 3) so for each of meta- phors and literal statements p < 0. 05 that the patient chose the target answer simply by choice. In aggregate for all 18 questions p < 0. 001 that the patient correctly selected 12 out of 18 target answers simply by chance. Looking specifically at the outcomes of the lanni et al. (2014) test patients, patient 444DX correctly answered 86. 4% of literal interpretation statements and 75% of metaphor interpretation statements. Patient 384BX correctly answered 88. 1% of literal interpretation statements and 51. 7% of meta- phor interpretation statements. Patient 642KM correctly answered 94. 9% of literal interpretation statements and 65. 5% of metaphor interpretation statements. Patients 384BX and 642KM were seen as having metaphor interpretation deficits with correct scores of 51. 7% and 65. 5%, respectively. Our patient correctly answered a higher percentage of meta- phor interpretation questions than both of these patients. Thus, while our patient understood the utilization of posed metaphors, the patient was unable to explain the meaning of common proverbs. Murphy et al. (2013) found that fluid intel- ligence was not significantly different across all groups within their trial. This, combined with our patient's competencies in other mental tasks, prevents the simple conclusion that this performance is based off of some intelligence discrepancy. Our patient understood literal explanations, could perform basic mathematical problems, could read, and could abstractly answer concrete hypothetical questions, but could not supply the correct interpretation of any proverb. We do not think the patient's profound anterograde amne- sia is the cause of the aproverbia. Indeed, proverb interpreta- tion does require contextual memory. However, intact retrograde memory is more imperative. Proverb interpretation can be seen as a procedural task one where a nonconcrete interpretation of a sentence is utilized, and that information is put into historical context based on usage in society. The patient's multiple references to the Olympics show that this patient could in fact use retrograde memory to draw upon historical context for the proverb; however, the patient was unable to fully explain his reasoning and was instead left with just a societal association. The patient also showed intact retrograde memory and logic regarding common taught life scenarios when answering what he would do in case of a fire or if he was hungry. Most of the literature on bilateral temporal lobe damage revolves around memory impairment, both anterograde and retrograde. When looking for examples of other patients with similar infarcts and language issues for comparison with our patient, we noticed a case study (Papagno, Capasso, & Miceli, Downloaded by [Flinders University of South Australia] at 03: 41 04 February 2016 2009) of a 72-year-old woman with left temporal pole and medial temporal cortex hypodensities seen on voxel-based morphometry. This patient was studied due to progressive loss of her proper noun vocabulary and subsequent impair- ment in recalling common names and biographical informa- tion of people well known to her. In the study, the impairment in the left temporal lobe was associated with intact abstract language and capabilities, and selective abstraction prefer- ence over use of concrete nouns. The woman could not name a face shown to her, but could fluently talk about and define abstract concepts. This semantic dementia and reversed concreteness effect is thus the inverse deficit as our patient, who had difficulties with abstraction over concrete language. We have not seen a case with a similar deficit and lesion as our patient. We also did not find any cases of focal unilateral cerebellar damage causing overly concrete thinking. Discussion with the patient's family revealed that this patient had a history of generalized deficit in concrete think- ing. (The patient does not have a history of Asperger's and his engaging nature with physicians and staff goes against this being the cause of his concrete thinking. ) Answers such as the ones he gave during the PIT when read back to the family were deemed not atypical of his thinking long before the anoxic event for which the patient presented to us. In spite of all of this, meticulous radiological interpretation of the MRI revealed no lesions in any of the seven areas implicated in metaphor interpretation (Yang et al. , 2010) , left or right hemi- sphere damage in the patients of lanni et al. (2014) , and left or right hemisphere frontal lesions in the patients with deficits in proverb interpretation of Murphy et al. (2013) . There was only the newly acquired bilateral anoxic injury to the hippocampi. It appears the neurophysiologic substrate for this deficit is not clear at all, and proves to be a very captivating puzzle. However, as the MRI was done just a week after injury, it is possible that our patient has diffuse brain damage and this was present at the time of our testing, but was not yet able to be detected on MRI. Our findings suggest a more stringent testing regimen that can be deployed at bedside for patient evaluation of brain injury and other patients. Patients are often asked to repeat phrases during a neurological examination to assess proper functioning of the comprehension-repetition pathways as well as the function and coordination of the oral muscles of speech. There are many layers to language comprehension, however. Our patient recovered from an anoxic brain injury with subtle neurological deficits that were elucidated only after directed and specific testing. There are patients who likely have passed all of the current more concrete neurolo- gical and cognitive evaluations who could be discharged from the hospital only to suffer after returning to work, school, or normal life where social interaction includes metaphors, pro- verbs, and other quirks of our modern language. These tests could be integrated by choosing one proverb and one meta- phor for a patient to repeat and then interpret. It would make sense to test a patient's understanding of proverbs, then transition to metaphor comprehension testing depending on the patient's responses. An important question concerns rehabilitation for this patient. Concrete thinking and aproverbia has been a chronic but NEUROCASE @) 5 tolerated issue for a patient who had been able to function independently. But for many patients, cognition is considered the primary limiting factor for rehabilitation, as per evaluation by physical therapy and occupational therapy. Bronwell et al. (2013) revisited the topic researched in 1991 and devises a method for training patients in metaphor interpretation after TBI. Their method of training TBI patients to allow them to regain understanding of nonliteral language involved graphic displays of the semantic associations that underlie metaphor (Brownwell et al. , 2013, p. 447) . The patient is put through five task stages, starting with practice on evaluating connotations of single words, moving to evaluating associations of single words. Patients are then required to generate associations between two nouns, and then evaluate their own self-associations. Finally, the patients are required to choose a shared association for two nouns that provide the basis for a metaphor (p. 449) . While enacting these tasks, graphic representations were used through Thinking Maps . Nouns in circles were connected via lines to associations, in smaller circles. To complete a metaphor, two nouns were required to share and connect to the same association word. On analysis, the TBI patients in this study had statistically signifi- cant improvement on the assessment of oral metaphor interpre- tation. Could this idea be used to also help patients with aproverbia and other deficits in higher-level thinking improve functioning? There seem to be many more questions left asked than were there to begin with. The patient has a strikingly clear ischemic area that is acute on MRI imaging, yet the profound, selected aproverbia does not align the location of the lesion or any prior known or proposed location for the neurophysiolo- gic substrate for proverb or metaphor interpretation, and the aproverbia appears to be premorbid to the presenting anoxic event. Metaphor and proverb interpretation has been investi- gated for some time now, and while there is no consensus on the cortical areas responsible for this task, our patient's lesion does not fall into any location previously implicated in proverb or metaphor interpretation. Our case suggests there might be more areas still to be explored, damage to which can cause deficits in metaphor and proverb interpretation or that such deficits can be due to nonfocal generalized abnormalities. Deficits in metaphor and proverb interpretation definitely merit further investigation from cognitive, linguistic, func- tional, and neurophysiologic perspectives in healthy and patient populations.

        "other": "hemi- spheric damage (LHD) or right hemispheric damage (RHD) to interpret metaphors and found that RHD patients were drawn to the literal meaning of stimuli while LHD patients could understand and use metaphors. Yang et al (2010) attempted to pinpoint more closely where this processing occurred in the brain and concluded that impaired metaphoric comprehen- sion in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients arises from deficits in abstract thought as a whole. The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) was a location of specific interest and was considered to be important in the selection of appropriate interpretations when contextual information is not sufficient (Yang et al, 2010) . When compared to the TBI group, the control group demonstrated significantly more activity in six different brain clusters: the triangularis, opercularis of LIFG, precentral gyrus, supplementary motor areas, superior temporal pole, and left posterior middle temporal gyrus (Yang et al. , 2010) . In 2013, Murphy used a proverb interpretation test (PIT) to evaluate patients with frontal lobe lesions, differentiating between the lateral and medial frontal cortex on both sides CONTACT Eric L Altschuler eric. altschuler@temple. edu 2016 Taylor & Francis of the brain. Patients were asked to interpret eight metaphoric proverbs and were scored from 0 to 2: Responses that inter- preted the proverb in its abstract form were scored a 2, a partial abstract and correct response or a concrete yet accu- rate response was scored a 1, and an incorrect response, either concrete or abstract, was scored a 0 (Table 1) . During the analysis of the patients data, Murphy found that the medial frontal cortex subgroup performed significantly worse on the PIT than all lateral cortex patients combined. From their study, they concluded that impaired performance on the PIT is asso- ciated with bilateral medial frontal lobe lesions, whereas increased concrete responses to the PIT were associated with damage to the left lateral frontal lobe (Murphy et al. , 2013) . From further analysis, they concluded that the anterior medial prefrontal cortex was involved in selecting the less natural interpretation and that the medial frontal cortex played a key role in attentional energisation to initiate and sustain a specific thought process or behavior (Murphy et al. , 2013) . With these conclusions, they proposed that concrete responses on the PIT (rather than overall performance) could represent a more sensitive measure of frontal executive func- tion (Murphy et al. , 2013) . Finally, lanni, Cardillo, McQuire, and Chatterjee (2014) did an extensive study on metaphors. They felt that previous studies on metaphor comprehension after brain damage were not sufficiently thorough some including only RHD patients or excluding RHD patients who performed tasks at ceiling and that among all studies attempting to test meta- phor interpretation abilities and associated brain lesion loca- tion, there was heterogeneity of the stimuli and tasks given to the patients. The goal of this new study was to create a test that could reliably evaluate metaphor comprehension in a patient while preventing false positives by testing in neural basis for metaphor and proverb is still incompletely understood, all patient groups to be targeted for studied cannot yet be identified. It would be interesting to use a mini-metaphor and proverb exam to test patients routinely. Acknowledgments We thank E. Cardillo and A.

TWessex Neurological Centre, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, England \"Department of Psychology, University of Southampton, Southampton, England 3MRC Cyclotron Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, London, England ABSTRACT: _ The role of the hippocampus in retrograde amnesia re- mains controversial and poorly understood. Two cases are reported of discrete bilateral hippocampal damage, one of which was a rare case of limbic encephalitis secondary to the human herpes virus 6. Detailed memory testing showed marked anterograde memory impairment, but only mild, temporally-limited retrograde amnesia that covered a period of several years in both autobiographical and factual knowledge domains. The absence of extensive retrograde amnesia in these two cases points to a time-limited role for the hippocampus in the retrieval of retrograde memories, and suggests that entorhinal, perirhinal, parahippocampal, or neocortical areas of the temporal lobe may be more critical than the hippocampus proper for long-term retrograde memory functioning. Our findings offer general support to theories of memory consolidation that propose a gradual transfer of memory from hippocampal to neocortical dependency. Hippocampus 1999; 9: 247-254. 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc. KEY WORDS: memory human herpes 6 virus; limbic encephalitis; remote The role of the hippocampus and related structures in retrograde memory functioning has only recently become the focus of research in cognitive neuroscience. The status of retrograde amnesia in the human amnesic syndrome and its neural basis is more uncertain and controversial han the status of anterograde and retrieval come eventually to be supported by neocortex as the result of gradual changes in connectivity within neocortex. Human lesion studies have offered some clues as to the role of the hippocampus in retrograde memory, although many of the published studies suffer from some limitations. Investigations relating to the patient HM have variously reported a mild retrograde amnesia of 1-2 years to a retrograde amnesia of up to 13 years. As has been pointed out elsewhere (e. g. , Ogden and Corkin, 1991; Kapur et al. , 1994a) , there are some difficulties in interpreting H M's retrograde memory performance. In addition, his lesion is not restricted to the hippocampus (Corkin et al. , 1997) , and so his case study has a limited amount to offer with regard to our understanding of the ole of the hippocampusin retrograde memory function- ing. Schnider et al. (1994) reported dense anterograde and retrograde amnesia in their patient who suffered bilateral infarction of the hippocampi, with extension of the infarct on the left side to more lateral structures, including the parahippocampal gyri and neocortex of the posterior temporal/anterior occipital lobe. Although formal retrograde memory test data were not reported, the memory loss for pre-illness information appeared to equally affect autobiographical and semantic memories, and to extend back to the patient's childhood with little in the way of atemporal gradient. T he patient also had a significant naming deficit, and there may have been some contribution of this deficit to part of his retrograde amnesia. Lee et al. (1992) reported a 4-month period of autobiographical retrograde amnesia in their patient who suffered an amnesic attack associated with a tempo- = 248 KAPUR AND BROOKS ral lobe seizure. The anterograde memory impairment in this patient was more variable than in a classical amnesic syndrome. It is of note that an MR scan carried out several days after the apparent resolution of the retrograde amnesia showed bilateral hippocampal lesions, with no visible extension into more lateral structures. In alater study, Schnider et al. (1995) found that their patient, a 55-year-old farmer with bilateral hippocampal lesions who was different from the case reported by Schnider et al. (1994) , was unaware of personal events over the previous 10-15 years. He recognized the photographs of cattle that he owned more than 15 years ago, but not more recent ones. H e was also reported to have a temporally-graded retrograde amnesia for politicians who had become prominent over the previous 10-15 years. The lesions appeared to be restricted to swelling of both hippocampi, though it is difficult to be certain that there was no swelling of adjacent hippocampal formation structures. The aetiology of the lesion is uncertain, though the primary medical condition of the patient was systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . The relatively sudden onset of the amnesia suggests a vascular aetiology, though the authors themselves suggested a pathology related to an autoim- mune process. Reported cerebral complications of SLE tend to be more diffuse than selective hippocampal pathology of the type reported here, and there remains the possibility of additional esionsin this case that were not detected on M RI. A further note of caution is that the patient was a farmer, and it is not clear the extent to which he was interested in public events of the type that were used as part of the retrograde amnesia assessment; no formal est scores or control data were reported in this respect. Reed and Squire (1998) found extensive episodic and factual retrograde amnesia following hippocampal pathology only when hat pathology was accompanied by lesionsin additional temporal obe neocortex and not when it was confined to the hippocampus alone. These patients with extensive retrograde amnesia had esions associated with herpes simplex encephalitis. M attioli et al. 1996) reported FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan data in a case of focal retrograde amnesia, and found evidence of bilateral hippocampal and anterior cingulate glucose metabolic values. T he resolution of their scan did not permit the more detailed anatomical fractionation of the lesion. In one of the few post-mortem studies of amnesic patients Rempel-C lower et al. , 1996, p 5252) , the authors concluded that temporally-graded retrograde amnesia covering 15 years or more can occur after relatively circumscribed damage to the hippocam- pal formation. A further post-mortem study involved the case RB Zola-M organ et al. , 1986) who showed a moderate anterograde amnesia and minimal retrograde amnesia in association with a discrete lesion of the hippocampal formation that was restricted to he CA1 region. Recently, a case was reported (Kartsounis et al. , 1995) that postulated similar underlying lesions to those in the patient RB, although the damage in this new case appeared to extend to CA2 fields. The authors reported the presence of severe, ungraded retrograde amnesia in addition to a marked anterograde memory oss. Kartsounis et al. offered a note of caution, suggesting that, although detailed MRI scanning indicated only circumscribed structural damage in their patient, it was not possible to exclude subtle histological changesin other areas or remote hypoactivation effects of the hippocampal infarcts, particularly with regard to adjacent cortical areas and the mammillo-thalamic system. A morerecent PET study of this patient (K apur et al. , 1999) showed additional pathology in the right thalamus, and so the role of the hippocampal damage in this patient's retrograde amnesia remains uncertain. In light of the above studies, it is clear that further evidence needs to be gathered from well-documented cases of discrete hippocampal lesions in order to clarify the role of the hippocam- pus in retrograde memory function. Although such patients are rare, we were able to study two such cases whose hippocampal lesions could be verified using advanced brain imaging proce- dures. One of these cases was an instance of paraneoplastic encephalitis induced by the human herpes virus 6 in a patient who was immune-compromised due to a bone marrow transplant procedure (D robyski et al. , 1994) . CASE 1 BE (dob March 24, 1946) is a right-handed man who worked as a college lecturer. His past medical history was unremarkable except for mild symptoms in the early 1980s related to a possible diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. T hese symptoms resolved with a change in dietary regime, and he only took medication for a short period of time. He developed a viral encephalitis in M ay 1991, which was accompanied by acute memory loss for recent events, an odd sense of smell, and episodes of d ja vu. In the days following admission, he had two grand mal seizures. T here were no positive findings to suggest a herpes simplex virus, though antiviral treatment was given. A CT scan on the day of admission was reported as normal, as was a routine M RI scan carried out 11 days after admission. EEG investigations around this time showed bilateral temporal lobe abnormalities. In May 1992, a further MRI scan was carried out using a specially designed protocol (described in Kapur et al. , 1994b) that gave detailed views of memory-related brain structures. T he scans were independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists, who were blind to the neuropsychological test data. The scans were interpreted as showing discrete bilateral lesions (Fig. 1) that were restricted to the hippocampus (due to some degree of artefact on axial slices, only coronal images are shown here) . An FDG PET scan confirmed the presence of a focal area of bilateral hypometabo- lism in the medial temporal region. Neuropsychological Investigations T hese investigations were carried out in 1992. On the basis of six subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1981) , BE had a Verbal IQ of 120, a Performance IQ of 133, and a Full Scale IQ of 128. On the National Adult Reading Test-NART (Nelson, 1982) , BE had a predicted Full Scale IQ of 112. He performed normally on tests of naming (24/30) (McKenna and Warrington, 1983) and problem-solving ability (Nelson, 1976) . RETROGRADE AMNESIA 249 FIGURE 1. Coronal MR scan of patient BE, showing bilateral hippocampal lesions (arrowed) . Right and left sides are reversed, i. e. , reader's right refers to the left side of the brain. On the Wechsler M emory Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1987) , BE had a General Memory Quotient of 82 and a Delayed Recall Quotient of 59. On the List Learning and Design Learning subtests of the Adult M emory and Information Processing Battery (Coughlan and H ollows, 1985) , BE scored at less than the tenth percentile on the delayed recall trials. On the words and faces subtests of the Recognition M emory Test (Warrington, 1984) his performance was moderately impaired for words (raw score = 39, age-scaled score = 5) but normal for faces (raw score = 42, age-scaled score = 12) . On the Autobiographical M emory Interview (Kopelman et al. , 1990) , given in D ecember 1993, BE s recall of personal semantic events from childhood, early adult life, and recent adult life was normal, as was his recall of specific incidents from early childhood and early adult life. There was a marked impairment in his recall for specific incidents from his recent life, this covering periods that related to post-illness events. In some patients, the Autobiographi- cal Memory Interview can appear to be a relatively crude instrument, and may not do justice to specific experiences that are unique to an individual. We therefore carried out a detailed, but more informal, interview separately with BE and with his wife about recent events, such as holidays, which they had taken part in together. T hese sets of interviews provided consistent evidence of a pre-illness autobiographical amnesia of 2 years duration. Most autobiographical memory tests suffer from a general limitation relating to the verification of responses. BE was also administered a specially designed test of autobiographical memory that includes an element of verification within the design of the test. This test, the Shared Experiences Test, provides the subject with alist of townsand also several events (e. g. , funeral, wedding) , with the items displayed in two columns on an A4 sheet of paper. T hese are presented as a recognition test. T he subject has to circle those towns he has visited with his spouse. Towns in the test mainly refer to major citiesin the United Kingdom, together with local towns. T he test is given twice, once with instructionsto cover the whole of the person s life, and a second time to cover the period of time since the onset of the patient's amnesia. If the subject indicates that he has been to towns A, B, C, D, and E throughout his life, and on the second testing indicates that he has been to townsD and E in the time since his illness, then the visits to the towns A, B, and C are considered to reflect pre-illness (retrograde) memories. To provide a means of verifying responses, the test is also given to the patient's spouse, with identical instructions. In the case of BE, he had been together with his wife for about 20 years, and the time of testing was 1993, 2 years after the onset of his amnesia. Using this procedure, BE accurately referred to 15 of the 17 places that his wife indicated they had visited together prior to his amnesia, omitting only two places. He did make a number of false-positive responses, i. e. , he indicated that he had been to places with his wife that she had not marked. There were in all ten such responses; it is possible that he genuinely confused places that he had visited alone, either during or before his married life, with places he and his wife had visited together. On the D ead-or-Alive Test (Kapur et al. , 1989) , where he had to indicate whether a famous personality was dead or alive, how the person died, and when they died, BE had significantly impaired performance (t = 6. 92, P < 0. 05) for items from the 1980s, but he performed within normal limits for earlier items. He had a mild impairment for indicating whether current personalities were still alive, presumably reflecting in part his anterograde amnesia.

CASE 2 LC (dob July 5, 1961) was a right-handed man who had worked as a lawyer. In 1996, he developed chronic myelocytic eukaemia, and in July 1997 he underwent a bone-marrow ransplant procedure. This was a technical success, but in late August 1997 he developed encephalitis, which was traced to the herpes virus 6. His symptoms included a marked impairment of recent memory that initially had some elements of confabula- ion.

His condition deteriorated, and he died in late September 1997. Although a post-mortem was carried out, the brain pathology had by then advanced to such a stage that precise and meaningful brain-behavior correlations could not be made. As ound on subsequent MR scans and at post-mortem, these changes included dilatation of the lateral ventricles, involvement Y : ; DIED IN THE 1970s Patient BE AAControl subjects mean (+/ - 2 sds) DIED IN THE 1980s BE s performance on the D ead-or-Alive Test. of the basal ganglia, and softening of the white matter throughout the brain. It should be borne in mind that his condition progressed at a fairly rapid rate after the onset of his amnesia. His MR scan was carried out on September 3, 1997 and most of the neuropsycho- logical testing was carried out on September 9, 1997, with further testing on September 15, 1997. It is quite possible that lesions additional to those in the hippocampus were present at the time of the neuropsychological assessment, though the fact that his retrograde amnesia remained relatively discrete around this time is all the more remarkable in the context of his general medical condition, the severity of his anterograde amnesia, and the presence of some confabulation. Neuropsychological Investigations These investigations were limited by his general medical condition and extreme tiredness. LC was disoriented for time, and he gave his age as 5 years younger than he was. On the Wechsler M emory Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1987) , LC was markedly impaired on immediate and 30-minute delayed recall of stories (4%le and 1%le, respectively) . H edid not even recall having been told the stories. H isimmediate recall of designs was also impaired (2%le) , and he was unable to recall any of the designs after a delay. Assessment of his autobiographical memory was limited by his naming difficulties and occasional confabulation. LC s wife esti- mated that his memory loss for personal events stretched back for one year. Semi-structured interviews showed a patchy memory loss for afew eventsin the previous few years, but when given cues R FIGURE 3.

H e would give a fairly accurate account of the jobs he had held in the previous 10 years. Using a short form of the D ead-or-Alive Test (Kapur et al. , 1989) , he was presented with a list of names of personalities who had become famous during the last 40 years, and he had to indicate which ones had died. For personalities who had died, he performed rather lower than a group of five matched control subjects (mean age = 33 years, range = 30-38 years, mean NART = 116, range = 112-120) for items from the 1980s and 1990s, though his scores remained within two standard deviations of those of the control subjects (LC s score for the 1980s = 58. 82% and LC sscore for the 1990s = 38. 89%; control subjects mean score for items from the 1980s = 75. 29%, standard deviation = 12. 75, control subjects mean score for items from the 1990s = 60. 22%, standard deviation = 12. 76) . LC was administered a short form of the Verbal N ews Events Test (Kapur et al. , 1996) where he had to indicate which of three 252 KAPUR AND BROOKS PERCENTAGE SCORE 1980s DECADE FIGURE 4. events (one real event, two fictitious events) had occurred. He showed (Fig. 4) a significant impairment for items from the 1990s (t = 3. 59, P < 0. 05) . He performed much better for items from the 1980s, performing closer to a group of five matched control subjects (mean age = 33, range = 30-38, mean NART = 116, range = 112-120) , though a ceiling effect may have masked a mild impairment; the presence of a temporal gradient in this data, therefore, needs to be treated with caution Only alimited amount of more general cognitive testing could be given. On the basis of an adult reading test (N elson, 1982) , his score was equivalent to an IQ of 117. On the Information subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1981) , LC had an age-scaled score of 10. He had a moderate impairment on a picture naming test (M cKenna and Warrington, 1983) , scoring 14/30, and on the modified card sorting test (Nelson, 1976) he was only able to achieve two categories, with a 33. 3% rate of perseverative responses. DISCUSSION Our two cases of discrete, bilateral hippocampal damage showed a limited degree of retrograde amnesia, in the context of The retrograde amnesia that was present was mild and limited to a few years prior to the onset of amnesia. It did not differentially affect episodic rather than semantic retrograde memory functions. Our findings support the observations of Reed and Squire (1998) that the hippocampus proper has a limited role during the 100 90 oF 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 ty) e Patient LC + Control subjects' mean (+/ - 2sds) 1990s LC s performance on the Verbal News Events Test. performance of retrograde memory tasks, and that it is adjacent cortical and white matter structures in the temporal lobe, which may be more critical to retrograde memory functioning. One component of these structures includes the rhinal cortices (ento- rhinal and perirhinal cortex) . Thornton et al. (1997) trained monkeys on two sets of object discrimination learning tasks, one at 16 weeks prior to lesioning and the other at 1 week prior to lesioning. Following bilateral rhinal lesions, the monkeys showed memory loss for both sets of tasks, with no evidence of a temporal gradient in the memory loss (although it should be noted that the period of 16 weeks is within the period of retrograde amnesia suffered by our two patients) . Of significant interest was the further observation that the monkeys could now normally learn a new set of object discriminations. T his apparently critical role of the rhinal cortex for retrograde memory functions finds parallel in a study by Yoneda et al. (1994) . In patients with amnesia following herpes simplex encephalitis, Yoneda et al. reported that the degree of retrograde amnesia correlated with the extent of parahippocampal atrophy (which included the entorhinal area in their measurements) . In this study, retrograde amnesia appeared to be a composite of autobiographical and public events memo- ries. Our observations of limited retrograde amnesia following bilateral hippocampal damage are supported by two post-mortem studies, an earlier study by Penfield, and a more recent study by Oxbury et al. (1997) . Penfield and Mathieson (1974) reported detailed post-mortem findings on a case of marked anterograde amnesia, and mild retrograde amnesia, in a patient where there was bilateral pathology in the hippocampus, and also additional pathology in lateral temporal lobe structures. T hey also briefly reported a second similar case, but this case did not come to post-mortem. (Although their two cases are of interest in view o the detailed anatomical lesion information, it should be cautioned that no formal retrograde memory test data were reported in the paper. ) Their primary case was of an engineer, who had suffered temporal lobe seizures since 1940 (further details of this case are reported by Penfield and M ilner, 1958) . In 1946, he underwen removal of the anterior part of the lateral left temporal lobe, bu his seizures continued. Five years later in 1951, he underwen removal of the anterior left hippocampus as well as the uncus. He was left with a severe anterograde amnesia, and a retrograde amnesia that was described as initially covering recent years, bu shrinking to a period of several months. Post-mortem findings showed that the lesion on the left side was restricted to the lef anterior hippocampus, the amygdala, and the other left temporal areas removed at the time of surgery. T he parahippocampal gyrus was reported asintact. T he left entorhinal cortex is not specifically mentioned; its close proximity to the uncus (which was removed at surgery) suggests that it may have been compromised, but it is of note that the left parahippocampal gyrusis reported as normal. W hite matter gliosis was reported to be present in remaining parts of the left temporal lobe, but the neocortex in this region was considered to be intact. On the right side, the right hippocampus was shrunken; there was substantial neuronal lossin the pyramidal cell layer, the dentate gyrus was involved, and the alveus was gliosed. There was diffuse gliosis of gyral white matter in the parahippocampal, occipito-temporal and inferior temporal gyri on the right, but no abnormality was reported from the associated areas of the right temporal lobe neocortex. It is of note that the patient continued to work as an engineer after his amnesia, though he had to make extensive use of memory aids, and that his Wechsler Memory Quotient was 94. This suggests a moderate rather than severe amnesia. Both his anterograde amnesia, and the hippocampal pathology, would appear to be similar to the case RB (Zola-M organ et al. , 1986) , but the Penfield and M athieson patient had more extensive left lateral temporal lobe damage, and also more white matter gliosisin the temporal lobes. Oxbury et al. (1997) noted an unusual case of dense antero- grade amnesia, and much milder retrograde amnesia, in a patien who had several distinct pathologies. When 18 years of age, he underwent a left temporal lobectomy for long-standing temporal obe epilepsy. T his entailed removal of the medial and lateral left emporal lobe, including the hippocampus and sparing the superior temporal gyrus. H e recovered well from this procedure, apart from being left with a mild verbal memory impairment. Eight years later, in 1991, he sustained a minor head injury, and his was followed by a major convulsion. O ver the next few years, he had further seizures. In 1992, he had a major convulsion, associated with a probable episode of hypoxia. M RI scanning did not show any abnormality, other than that associated with the left emporal lobe lesion. After this, he was left with a dense anterograde amnesia. M RI scanning later showed significant righ hippocampal atrophy. Retrograde memory testing showed a definite autobiographical memory loss for a 16-month period prior to onset of amnesia (though it should be borne in mind tha he did have some seizure activity in this period) . There was evidence of a patchy retrograde amnesia for earlier years, mainly RETROGRADE AMNESIA 253 with regard to sequencing and detail of events. No tests of public events knowledge were given. The patient subsequently died 2 years after the onset of his amnesia. Post-mortem examination revealed, in addition to the old left temporal lobe abnormality, a pathological right hippocampus. T here was sparing of the right entorhinal cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, and the remain- ing lateral structures in the right temporal lobe. It would appear likely that the neural basis of retrograde memory functioning entails a matrix of distributed neural networks that is responsible for the laying down, storage, and retrieval of episodic memories. This view is similar to that espoused by Fuster (1997) for memory processes in general, and is consistent with recent functional imaging data relating to experi- ential recall (Andreasen et al. , 1995; Fink et al. , 1996) . Implicit in this proposal is a multi-stage model of memory consolidation that critically involves the hippocampal complex in the early stages, and involvement of entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, together with the neocortex, in later stages. It is worth noting that recent animal studies of retrograde amnesia have pointed to a sequential role for such structures in long-term memory consolidation (e. g. , Cho and Kesner, 1996; Izquierdo et al. , 1997; Izquierdo 1334-1342.

While the hippocampus has always been strongly implicated in memory formation, there has been a greater emphasis on neocortical or hippocampal-neocortical interaction in the case of retrieval of stored memories (Eichenbaum, 1997) . In his classic paper, Squire (1992, p 222-223) concluded on the basis of evidence up to that point, T he facts of retrograde amnesia can be summarized as follows: 1. When damage is imited to the CA1 region of human hippocampus, retrograde amnesia is imited to a period of a year or two at the most. 2. In patients with more complete damage to the hippocampal formation, retrograde amnesia can be extensive and temporally graded across a decade or more, with sparing of very old memories. 3.

As Squire and Alvarez (1995, p 173) have pointed out, data relating to the severity and pattern of retro- grade amnesia have implications for theories of memory consolidation. T hey concluded that the facts of tempo- rally-graded retrograde amnesia, and virtually all ac- counts of this phenomenon that involve the concept of memory consolidation, suggest that memory storage and M edina, 1997) . In summary, absence of major retrograde amnesia in our two cases points to a temporally-specific role for the hippocampus in retrieval of retrograde memories, and suggests that rhinal/ parahippocampal or neocortical areas of the temporal lobe may be more critical than more medial structures for long-term retrograde memory functioning. Our findings offer general support to theories of memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez, 1995) that propose a gradual transfer of memory from hippocampal to neocortical dependency.

Detailed neuropsychological assessment revealed deficits in verbal fluency, word finding, confrontation naming, and anterograde memory for verbal material. High-resolution computed tomography with stereotaxic lesion localization permitted the determination of the thalamic nuclei involved in the infarction. We suggest that the patient s problem in language and verbal memory reflected a defect in memory processing for verbal material during registration, reten- tion, and retrieval, and that this defect probably resulted from a left anterior thalamic lesion affecting the ventrolateral nucleus, centromedian-parafascicular nuclei complex, internal medullary lamina, or mamillothalamic tract. Mori E, Yamadori A, Mitani Y: Left thalamic infarction and disturbance of verbal memory: a clinicoanatomical study with a new method of computed tomographic stereotaxic Jesion localization. Ann Neurol 20: 671-676, 1986 Left unilateral thalamic damage has been associated with disturbances of language and verbal memory [6]. Although evidence has been provided by cases of neo- plasm [26], hemorrhage [2], and stereotaxic operation {23}, clinicoanatomical correlation has been difficult because of possible mass effect in the former two, and because of preoperative disease in the last. Systematic assessment cafried out in instances of smaller, more discrete spontaneous lesions of the thalamus, such as infarction, provides more information regarding the role of the thalamus in language and memory. We found only a few reported cases of thalamic infarction causing language disturbance {8, 10, 11, 17] or verbal amnesia [1, 27}, or both [4, 12, 13, 18}. The structure within the thalamus responsible for each disturbance and the relationship between the two remain obscure. We recently had the opportunity to examine and treat a patient who had a mild degree of language distur- bance characterized by defects of verbal fluency, word finding and naming, and anterograde verbal amnesia after a discrete left thalamic infarction. Newly devel- oped neuroimaging techniques provided more detailed neuroanatomical analyses. Case Report A Al-year-old right-handed university-educated storekeeper experienced headache and diplopia on April 14, 1985. He veered to the right in walking. His wife stated that he had seemed sleepy and unable to remember anything. He had been well the previous evening, and his past health was excellent. Two days later, he was admitted to the Neu- rology Service of the Hyogo Brain and Heart Center at Himeji. On admission, findings from general examination were un- remarkable. He seemed to be slightly euphoric and uncon- cerned with his deficits. He displayed hypersomnia and inat- tention; he often lay in bed with his eyes closed and yawned frequently. He was disoriented for time and place, but not for person. He could repeat 5 digits forward and could recall only one of three objects after five minutes. Remote mem- ory was essentially preserved; he could correctly report his personal history but he made paraphasic errors and had diffi- culty with word finding. Language was fluent and not dysar- thric, with frequent word-finding pauses, perseverations, and predominantly verbal and neologistic paraphasias. At times he was unable to give either his address or job title despite repeated attempts. Auditory and reading comprehension were generally good. Confrontation naming was moderately impaired, with considerable paraphasia, particularly aug- mented verbal and neologistic errors, e. g. , he said Ko-o-tsu (neologistic jargon) instead of shiitsu (bedsheets) and kago (basket) instead of gomibako (dust can) . Further- mote, extended jargon was produced; for example, when shown a comb, he called it a mass of teeth brushes (in Japanese) . He correctly named 18 of 20 room objects, 16 of 20 body parts, and 9 of 13 colors. Repetition was excellent.

Accepted for publication Apr 5, 1986. Address reprint requests to Dr Mori. 671 Reading aloud was good. Writing was impaired; considerable paragraphia was seen only in Kanji-writing. Praxis and visuospatial perception were normal. His ability to do serial sevens was markedly deficient. Vertical gaze paresis was present, more noticeable on up- ward gaze. Bell s phenomenon was weakly present. With visual fixation, passive head movements elicited full upward gaze. Convergence was impaired. There were no motor, sen- sory, reflex, or coordination abnormalities, except for ques- tionable right lower facial and brachial weakness. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain on admission revealed a discrete hypodense area in the left anterior tha- lamic region compatible with an ischemic lesion. An electro- encephalogram indicated slowing in the left frontocentral area. Auditory brainstem responses and visual evoked re- sponses were normal, and somatosensory evoked responses after stimulation of the unilateral median nerve demonstrated bilaterally normal P14, N20, N34, and N60 at the pari- etal electrode. Four-vesse] cerebral arteriography carried out nine days after the onset of his illness was normal. The left posterior cerebral artery filled from the left internal carotid artery, indicating a large posterior communicating artery on that side. Selective injection of the left vertebral artery filled both posterior cerebral arteries. The paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic arteries {22} filled from the mesence- phalic portion of the left posterior cerebral artery, and the thalamogeniculate and posterior choroidal arteries arising from the more distal trunk of the left posterior cerebral artery were well visualized; however, the perforating arteries arising from the posterior communicating artery (the polar artery [22]) could not be identified. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Complete analyses of blood and urine yielded nor- mal findings, including studies of coagulation. Electrocardio- grams and echocardiograms were normal. During the next two weeks, hypetsomnia, disorientation, inattention, and dyscalculia subsided completely, and the fan- guage disturbance abated considerably. He was no longer euphoric and was well aware of his deficits. Downward gaze paresis disappeared, but upward gaze paresis persisted. An- terograde memory deficits for verbal material remained prominent. Ten days after admission, digit span was 6 for- ward; paired association learning (using the item of Miyake s Retention Test, which consists of 10 easily associated word pairs) was severely defective: 0 (8. 5) , 1 (9. 4) , 0 (9. 9) (mean score of normal controls are given in parentheses {19]) ; and performance on the Benton Visual Retention Test [16] was 7/10 (correct response : low average) . Two weeks after admis- sion, a second CT scan was obtained with a 5-mm slice thick- ness with and without contrast medium; it showed the same area of lucency with no enhancement. There was no evi- dence of other lesions. The patient was discharged and returned to his job eight weeks after the onset, but he remained amnestic for verbal material. He often complained that he forgot the terms of agreements with customers, although he remembered that he had talked with them. When follow-up neuropsycholog- ical tests were carried out five months later, his anterograde verbal amnesia remained unchanged, despite great improve- ment in language. He displayed only a mild reduction of word fluency.

Neuropsychological Study Formal neuropsychological testing was performed from May 24 to June 14, 1985. The following tests were used: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale JJapa- nese version) , Token Test (Japanese version) , Standard Language Test of Aphasia [30], Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) (Japanese version) {16, 33}, Miyake s Re- tention Test {19}, Rey s Auditory Verbal Learning Task (AVLT) (Japanese version) {16}, Benton Visual Retention Test [16], Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test {16}, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [16]. The Japanese versions of the WMS and AVLT were pre- pared privately in our institute. The results of these tests are summarized in the Table. His intelligence was normal. With regard to language function, only naming, generation of word lists (word fluency) , and Kanji-writing were mildly de- fective for the patient s intelligence and educational level. The Wechsler Memory Quotient was considered to be slightly low for his intelligence. His performance on the WMS logical memory test was significantly lower than that expected for his verbal IQ (p = 0. 005) {31}. On the associative learning task of the WMS, he achieved a score 3 standard deviations (SD) below the level of performance expected. The result of Miyake s Retention Test was far below normal [19]. His defec- tive verbal learning ability was also ascertained on the AVLT. Scores for Trials 1 through 5 were 3 SD less than that expected for professionals. The decrease of 7 672 Annals of Neurology Vol 20 No 6 December 1986 words from the fifth to the sixth trial (recall following an interference) was exceedingly abnormal. His per- formance on the recognition trial was also grossly de- fective [16]. On the visual reproduction task of the WMS, his performance was excellent on both im- mediate recall and 30-minute delayed recall [16]. The results of the Benton Visual Retention Test, both im- mediate (Administration A) and 15-second delayed (Administration D) recall, were normal {16}. Frontal lobe function, as far as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated, was normal. Neuroanatomical Study Neuroanatomical study was based on high-resolution CT (Toshiba TCT60A) and magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) (Picker International VISTA-MR 0. 15T) . CT and MRI examinations were done on June 11 and 12, 1985, respectively. The CT scan was obtained with a 2-mm slice thick- ness in planes parallel to the foramen of Monro (FM) posterior commissure (PC) line, which is nearly paral- lel to the orbitomeatal line. Computer rearrangement of data was obtained in the coronal planes, perpendicu- lar to the FM-PC line, beginning at the plane passing through the posterior margin of the FM and passing posteriorly by 2-mm increments to the posterior mar- gin of the lesion. The FM-PC line and the midline were used as reference lines to localize specific struc- tures. Although the intercommissural line has also been generally used as a reference line [4, 14], we preferred the FM-PC line because it is anatomically more reliable than the intercommissural line [3], and the FM is more easily localizable on the axial CT plane than the anterior commissure. Accurate anteropos- terior positioning for the coronal reconstruction was made by counting pixels (3 pixels = 2 mm) from the posterior margin of the FM on the axial transverse CT plane containing the FM-PC line. On the coronally reconstructed CT plane passing through the posterior margin of the FM, the FM-PC plane was drawn as a horizontal line passing through the inferior margin of the FM, and the midplane was drawn as a vertical line bisecting the third ventricle (Fig 1) . The two lines on this standard coronal CT plane were superimposed on all subsequent coronal CT planes. A 35-mm positive transparency of each coronal CT plane was projected onto the appropriate coronal section drawing selected from the stereotaxic atlas of Andrew and Watkins [3], and an outline of the lesion was drawn on it (Fig 2) . According to that atlas, the structures involved are as follows: (1) the nucleus oralis internus, nucleus oralis externus, and nucleus ventralis intermedius, which cor- respond to the entire ventrolateral nucleus (VL) ; (2) the nucleus centromedianus (CM) , nucleus parafasci- cularis (Pf) , and internal medullary lamina (IML) ; (3) Fig 1.

(R = right; L = left. ) (Bottom) Coronal reconstruction through the posterior margin of the FM. The determined FM-PC plane and midplane (M) , represented as two lines on this CT plane, were superimposed on all subsequent coronal CT reconstructions. Hort- zontal and vertical lines ave drawn at intervals of 10 mm. the mamillothalamic tract (MTT) ; (4) the zona incerta and field H1 of Forel; and (5) a rostral part of the red nucleus. The MRI scan was obtained with horizontal, coro- nal, and sagittal sections using the inversion-recovery method (Fig 3) . Slice thickness was 10 mm. The image of the lesion provided by MRI was essentially the same as that shown by CT. The substantial enlargement of the sylvian fissure bilaterally was judged to be an ar- tifact. Horizontal and sagittal sections revealed that a rostral part of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the red nucleus in the left side were involved. No other lesions were found by MRI examination. In summary, the infarct affected the territory of the polar artery and paramedian artery [22]. The dorsome- dial nucleus (DM) was probably spared except for small areas ventral and lateral to it. Discussion The present experience and a review of cases of a similar nature {1, 4, 8, 10-13, 17, 18, 27} suggest that core language symptoms due to ischemic damage to the left thalamus consist of disturbances of verbal flu- Mori et al: Left Thalamic Infarction 673 ency, word finding, and confrontation naming. This disturbance of language can be interpreted as an im- pairment in mobilization of necessary words from the vocabulary that will fit an idea, and thus is a distur- bance at the level of retrieval [24]. Retrieval is the process of localizing and removing material from the long-term memory store [24]. As for the patient s mnemic problem, the result of the AVLT is instruc- tive. Abnormally low performance on Trial 1, consid- erable shrinkage of recall over Trials 5 to 6, and no significant facilitation on the recognition trial may re- flect a problem not only with the retrieval phase of verbal memory but also with the registration and re- tention phases. Thus, we conclude that the defects in language and anterograde verbal memory indicate a defective memory processing of verbal material at all three phases. The thalamus may be a critical site for this function. This combination of symptoms has been reported in left thalamic lesions. Cambier and Graveleau [6] no- ticed that disturbance of memory for verbal material almost always accompanied thalamic aphasia and might Fig 2.

Magnetic resonance imaging shows a discrete left thalamic infarction. persist even when the latter had considerably im- proved. Archer and co-workers {4}, Michel and as- sociates {18}, and Goldenberg and associates [12} described such patients. Speedie and Heilman [27] reported a patient with left thalamic infarction and anterograde verbal amnesia who had no language dys- function. However, they noted their patient s de- creased verbal fluency in their later publication [28]. In considering the anatomoclinical correlation, de- struction of the VL, CM-Pf complex, IML, or MTT is the likely explanation for the disturbance of verbal memory process. The role of the VL in language func- tion has been repeatedly stressed [8, 10, 17}. Ojemann and co-workers [21} attributed a specific attention mechanism to the VL, the destruction of which dis- rupts mnemic processes insofar as these mechanisms are important for input to and retrieval from the verbal memory store. There is, however, little direct evidence so far that the VL is involved in memory function. The VL appeared to be affected in the patients described by Archer and co-workers {4}, Michel and co-workers {18}, and Goldenberg and associates {12}. Recently, von Cramon and co-workers {9}, suggested that the nucleus ventrooralis internus (part of the VL) is a can- didate for the mediation of memory processing. Al- though the association of bilateral ischemic damage to the DM with severe amnestic syndrome has been re- ported [5, 7, 9, 15, 20, 25, 34}, the role of the DM in mnemic function remains controversial. In most cases of bilateral ischemic damage to the DM, the lesion also affected the MTT [7, 9}, thus interrupting the exit of Papez s circuit. Castaigne and associates [7] claimed that the MTT was the site responsible for mnemic impairment. According to them, only bilateral and al- most complete lesions of the DM cause disturbance of memory; even then it is only a transient phenomenon, and such lesions do not fall into the polar and parame- dian territory. von Cramon and co-workers [9] sug- gested that the MTT and the ventral part of the IML are the most likely candidates in the mediation of memory processes, that a combined lesion of these structures might be responsible for thalamic amnesia, and that the DM does not play a critical role. With respect co unilateral damage, although Squire and Moore [29] and Speedie and Heilman {27} insisted that a lesion of the left DM was responsible for verbal amnesia, the CT sections shown in their articles were too poor to conclude that the infarct affected the DM. The roles of two nuclei remain to be proved, namely the CM-Pf complex, which has extensive connections with the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus [32}, and the IML, lesions of which disrupt the connections between the DM and its projection sites of the pre+ frontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and amyg- dala. It also remains unproved whether combinations of lesions are required for amnesia, and if so, which combinations are necessary. : Initial hypersomnia, signs of mental deterioration, and perhaps transient language disturbance including nonaphasic bizarre jargon could be attributed to a uni- lateral lesion in the CM-Pf complex; this complex is part of the rostral extension of the mesencephalic re- ticular activating system, damage to which may affect vigilance or attention [32]. Alternatively, they could be the resule of acute effects of ischemia, such as ede- ma and hypoperfusion to surrounding structures. Al- though Graff-Radford and co-workers {13} maintained Mori et al: Left Thalamic Infarction 675 that left thalamic infarction causes dementia, it is doubtful whether a giobal cognitive abnormality can be attributed to an anterolateral thalamic lesion per se. Because of the presence of more extensive physi- cal signs, combined occipital lobe infarction or basal meningitis more extensive intrathalamic and extra- thalamic lesions could participate in the cognitive disturbance in their patients. The thalamus is a small mass, less than 20 mm high, into which many nuclei and fibers converge. Conven- tional CT, using 10-mm slices, has only a limited ca- pacity to localize the specific nuclei affected. Archer and associates [4] used a sagittal reconstruction of high-resolution CT passing through the center of the Jesion and a stereotaxic lesion localization technique with the intercommissural line as a reference. Graff- Radford s group [14] proved the reliability of this method based on autopsy evidence of bilateral infarc- tion of the thalamus, although they missed the lateral part of the lesion because sagittal reconstruction was not carried far enough laterally. We performed high- resolution CT with thin slices using a new method of stereotaxic lesion localization and MRI with three- directional sectioning. Our method of stereotaxic lo- calization, therefore, may be more reliable than that of Archer and co-workers [4]. Precise analysis of isch- emic lesions, as well as thorough neuropsychological evaluation, should provide us with further insights re- garding the role of the thalamus in cognitive function.

Squire 2. 3 Departments of *Psychiatry and 2Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, and 3Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego, California 92161 Two patients with presumed hippocampal formation lesions and two patients with more extensive temporal lobe damage, all of whom became amnesic in a known year, were given tests of anterograde and retrograde memory function. The two pa- tients with hippocampal formation lesions had moderately se- for facts and events that affected, at most, the decade preceding the onset of amnesia. Content analysis could not distinguish the autobiographical recollections of the patients from the rec- ollections of control subjects. The two patients with more ex- tensive temporal lobe damage had ss for both facts and events. The results suggest that whether retrograde amnesia is temporally limited or very extensive depends on whether the damage is restricted to the hippocampal formation or also involves additional temporal cortex. Key words: retrograde amnesia; anterograde amnesia; hip- pocampal formation; medial temporal lobe; autobiographical memory; fact memory Retrograde amnesia (RA) refers to loss of memory for informa- tion acquired before the onset of amnesia. The condition is commonly observed after medial temporal lobe or diencephalic pathology, and it has fascinated psychologists, biologists, and clinicians for over 100 years (Ribot, 1881) . An understanding of RA should have considerable implications for understanding the organization of normal memory as well as the function of the damaged brain structures. Yet the facts themselves are not agreed on. For example, RA has been described as typically extensive and ungraded, affecting recent and very remote memories alike (Sanders and Warrington, 1971; Warrington, 1996) . Alterna- tively, RA has been described as usually temporally graded, sparing remote memory (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975; Squire and Alvarez, 1995) . With respect to what kind of memory impairment occurs, RA sometimes has been described as affect- ing both fact (semantic) memory and autobiographical (episodic) memory similarly (Verfaellie et al. , 1995; Rempel-Clower et al. , 1996) . Alternatively, RA has been described as affecting autobio- graphical memory across a patient s entire lifetime and affecting fact memory to a much lesser degree (Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997) . There are several reasons why these issues have been slow to resolve. A major factor is that, even when quantitative neuropsy- chological testing is performed, adequate neuropathological in- formation about the patients is not always available. Yet anatom- ical data could be fundamental to understanding similarities and differences in the behavioral findings. In some instances, useful anatomical information has been obtained from magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) , although the amount of available detail Received Dec. 18, 1997; revised Feb. 26, 1998; accepted March 4, 1998.

Neurohistological data from post- mortem examination, in conjunction with quantitative neuropsy- chological data about RA, are available for only four patients with lesions restricted bilaterally to the medial temporal lobe [R. B. , Zola-Morgan et al. (1986) ; G. D. , W. H. , and L. M. , Rempel- Clower et al. (1996) ]. In a few other cases of medial temporal lobe lesions, detailed neurohistological information is presented, but only clinical impressions are available about the RA (Victor et al. , 1961; Penfield and Mathieson, 1974; Victor and Agamanolis, 1990) . Another major difficulty is that the study of past memory in amnesic patients relies necessarily on retrospective methods and imperfect tests. For tests of factual knowledge (e. g. , public events tests) , individuals vary widely in how much they know about the subject matter, independent of the influence of amnesia. For tests of autobiographical knowledge, it is often not possible to verify the accuracy of the recollections, and there are also difficult issues concerning how best to score the content of what is remembered. The available data suggest that RA can vary considerably in its severity from temporally limited RA covering up to a few years to more extensive, ungraded RA involving all of the decades covered by the tests (Squire, 1992; Hodges, 1994; Schmidtke and Vollmer, 1997) . Many questions remain, however, about what kind of retrograde impairment is most typical in amnesia and what specific neuropathology is associated with the various pre- sentations of RA. It also remains unclear whether autobiograph- ical memory usually is affected to the same degree as fact memory or whether autobiographical memory usually is affected much more severely than fact memory. We have assessed RA in four patients, three of whom had detailed MRI examinations to characterize the lesions. One has damage limited to the hippocampal formation, a second was not eligible for MRI but is presumed to have hippocampal formation damage based on etiology, and two others have hippocampal formation damage together with amygdala damage and additional temporal cortical damage.

T. ) and one woman (L. J. ) (Tables 1, 2) . Two patients (A. B. and L. J. ) have damage apparently limited to the hippocampal formation. Patient A. B. became amnesic after a cardiac arrest in 1976. A physician friend and his wife, a nurse, were with A. B. at the time of his arrest and were able to administer resuscitation (CPR) immediately. He arrived at the hospital within 30 min, at which time he was in ventricular fibrillation and having generalized seizures. After treatment, he was breathing spontaneously and maintaining good levels of blood oxygen with minimal supplementation. Seizure activity ceased after the second hospital day, but he remained comatose for the next 8 d. Neurological examination in 1978 indicated mildly impaired cerebellar function, but examinations in 1987 and 1998 found no cerebellar or Parkinsonian signs. On the basis of these findings and the etiology of his amnesia, A. B. is presumed to have circumscribed hippocampal formation damage. This cannot be confirmed with MRI, however, because he wears a pacemaker. For patient L. J. , MRI (Squire et al. , 1990) identified that the hip- pocampal region (subtended by the fimbria, dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subiculum) was reduced in size (left side, 0. 37 cm ; right side, 0. 42 cm?; six control subjects averaged 0. 56 cm? on the left and 0. 63 cm? on the right) (Fig. 1A) . Likewise, the size of the hippocampal formation was reduced when its area was calculated as a percentage of the size of the temporal lobe (left side, 3. 23%; right side, 3. 38%; six controls averaged 5. 02% on the left and 5. 34% on the right) . L. J. became amnesic with no known precipitating event during a 6 month period that began in late 1988. Her memory impairment has remained stable since trials (maximum score = 10/trial) . The word recall score is the mean percentage of 15 words re tage of 15 words identified correctly by yes/no recognition across five s (modified from Warrington, 1984) (maximum score = 50; chance scores for Words and Faces were obtained after a delay of 5 min, not 24 hours. The mean scores for healthy control subjects for these tests are from Squire and rieth, 1994) (maximum score = 36) . The average score 2 is the number of word pairs recalled on three ive study-test trials (Rey, 1964) . The word The scores for words and faces is based 25) . Hed that time. Both A. B. and L. J. have moderately severe and clinically significant amnesia. Neither is capable of independent living. Two other patients developed profound amnesia after herpes simplex encephalitis (E. P. in 1992 and G. T. in 1990) . Both patients have large, radiologically confirmed, bilateral lesions of the temporal lobe that in- clude the hippocampal formation (Squire and Knowlton, 1995; Hamann et al. , 1996) . E. P. s damage is primarily medial temporal but also involves the laterally adjacent fusiform gyrus at some levels. G. T. s damage is more extensive and involves much of the temporal lobe bilaterally (Fig. 1B, C) . Neuropsychological data for the four patients are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and in Figure 2. Note that all four patients exhibit amnesia despite obtaining intelligence scores within the normal range. Note also that the two postencephalitic patients who have more extensive lesions also have more severe anterograde memory impairment. Control subjects. Two groups of control subjects were recruited from volunteers and employees at the San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center. One group consisted of nine individuals, five matched to patient A. B. and four to L. J. As a group they averaged 62. 3 years of age and 15. 9 years of education. They scored 22. 4 and 52. 6, respectively, on the Information and Vocabulary subscales of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) (22 and 57. 5 for the patients) . Four additional individuals with a mean of 11. 5 years of education served as controls for the postencephalitic patients, E. P. and G. T. Be- cause the two patients differ by 14 years in age, these control subjects were selected to match the older patient (E. P. , age 74 years) with respect to age (mean, 73 years) . By matching the age of this group to the older patient, we expected to obtain a conservative measure of normal memory performance. Retrograde memory tests New vocabulary (recall and recognition) . Subjects completed a vocabulary test involving 82 words that had entered into common English usage between 1955 and 1989 (1955-1959, n = 12; 1960-1969, n = 24; 1970- 1979, n = 24; 1980-1989, n = 22) (Verfaellie et al. , 1996) . Twelve additional common words (e. g. , tuxedo, moron) were included to assess baseline vocabulary ability. A recall test was given first in which each word (e. g. , zilch) was presented, and the subjects were asked to provide Reed and Squire * Retrograde Amnesia Figure 1. Magnetic resonance images for three of the four amnesic patients. For L. J. (A) , a coronal T-1 weighted image is shown through the midlevel of the hippocampal formation. The area of her hippocampal formation bilater- ally is 66% of the area calculated for six control subjects and well outside the control range. For E. P. (B) , an axial T-2 weighted image through the temporal lobe shows the extent of bilateral medial temporal lobe damage, which extends caudally from the temporal pole and damages bilaterally the perirhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, the amygdaloid complex, and the hippocampal region (CA fields, dentate gyrus, and subicular complex) . The lesion extends laterally to include the fusiform gyrus at some levels, and small foci of damage are apparent in the right medial and dorsal frontal cortex. Finally, reduced volume of the insular cortex and inferotemporal gyrus is apparent bilaterally, although it is unclear how abnormal a finding this is or what implications it has for neuropathology. For GT. (C) , an axial T-2 weighted image through the temporal lobe shows the damage extending through the anterior 7. 0 cm of his left temporal lobe and through the anterior 5. 0 cm of his right temporal lobe. The lesion includes bilaterally the amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices as well as the inferior, middle, and superior tem- poral gyri. There is also bilateral damage in the insular cortex, medial and orbital frontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Asterisks in A indicate the position of the hippocampus on each side. a definition. Responses were scored as either correct or incorrect. Immediately after recall, subjects completed a four-alternative multiple choice form of the same test (e. g. , zilch: to destroy or eliminate; a stain; a filmy residue; zero or nothing) . Public events (recall and recognition) . The test consisted of 145 ques- tions about public events that had occurred from 1940 through 1995 (1940s, n = 19; 1950s, n = 17; 1960s, n = 24; 1970s, n = 27; 1980s, n = 30; 1990s, n = 28) (Squire, 1975; Squire et al. , 1989) . The test was administered first in a recall format (e. g. , Who killed John Lennon?) , and immediately afterward in a four-alternative multiple choice format (John Hinkley, Sara Jane Moore, David Roth, Mark Chapman) . Famous faces (recall and recognition) . Subjects were asked to identify 141 photographs of famous people who came into the news school. ) . The portion of the test that assessed personal semantic knowledge consisted of 41 items (Childhood, n = 12; Early Adult Life, n = 16; Recent Life, n = 13) , and the maximal possible score for each time period was 21. The portion of the test that assessed autobiographical memory consisted of nine items (three per time peri- od) , and the maximum score was 9 for each time period (maximum 3 points per item, 0-3 scoring scale) . For each amnesic patient, the accu- racy of all responses was established in interviews with at least two family members whose combined familiarity with the patient spanned virtually 3946 J.

Patients were asked to copy the figure illustrated in the small box to the bottom left and, 5-10 min later, to reproduce it from memory. The copy (top) and the reproduction (bottom) are shown from left to right for the four patients and for a representative control subject (CON) . Neither E. P. nor G. T. recalled copying the figure. Encouraged to draw whatever came to mind, patient E. P. declined to try and G. T. produced a drawing of a horse s head. his/her entire lifetime. Responses were assigned a zero score if any family member identified it as inaccurate. Word association test of autobiographical memory. A set of 48 common nouns (e. g. , dog, water, school) was used to elicit autobiographical memories, using methods described previously (Crovitz and Schiffman, 1974; MacKinnon and Squire, 1989) . The words were read aloud one at a time, and the subjects were asked to recollect an autobiographical episode that could be associated with each word. When a subject failed to provide a memory that was clearly specific to time and place, probes were given to elicit the fullest possible response. Probing was done in two ways: (1) encouragement was given to be more specific about an already stated memory, and (2) if a subject could not produce any episode, concrete possibilities were suggested to help the subject recall one. When subjects reported a memory that they had already described in response to a previous cue word, they were asked to recollect a different memory. Finally, when a subject did describe a specific incident, he or she was asked to estimate its date. Twenty-four cue words were used to assess the remote time period, and 12 cue words each were used to assess the recent and middle time periods. The years defining each time period were determined individ- ually for each subject. For the amnesic patients, the years of their life before they became amnesic were partitioned into three approximately equal-sized time periods (Recent, Middle, Remote) . Only four control subjects were tested (those matched to E. P. and G. T. ) , and their Recent, Middle, and Remote time periods were defined as three equal-sized periods covering their entire lives. For each subject the testing required 4-10 sessions, each lasting 1-2. 5 hr. An index card displaying the first and last year of the time period of interest was in the subject s view at all times. The first 36 of the 48 cue words were used to probe all three periods. Four words were used to probe one time period, then four more were used to probe another time period, and so on until each of the three time periods had been probed with 12 cue words each. All subjects were tested with the same order of words and the same order of time periods. The final 12 cue words were used to probe only the Remote time period. Testing sessions were tape recorded for later scoring by two independent raters. The correlation between their scores was 0. 94. Recollections were rated on a 0-3 scale, as described previously (Zola-Morgan et al. , 1983) , and the average of the two raters scores was used as the score for the response to each cue word. For each amnesic patient the accuracy of all responses was established in interviews with at least two family members whose combined familiarity with the patient spanned virtually his/her entire lifetime. Information and vocabulary subscales and Boston Naming Test. To evaluate the possible impact on our Remote memory tests of anomia and pervasive loss of general knowledge, we administered the Information and Vocabulary subscales of the WAIS-R NI (WAIS-R as a Neuropsy- chological Instrument; Kaplan et al. , 1991) . These subscales are identical in the WAIS-R and the WAIS-R NI except that the WAIS-R NI includes multiple choice (recognition) versions of all of the test items. Finally, we administered the Boston Naming Test both in its standard format (Kaplan et al. , 1983) and in a four-alternative multiple choice format. All testing was done in 1996. Data analysis. Because the patients all became amnesic in a known year, it was possible to assess each patient s anterograde and retrograde memory function separately and then average together the scores from appropriate time periods to obtain group means (Table 3) . Test items from the decade (L. J. , E. P. , and G. T. ) or three decades (A. B. ) after the onset of their amnesia were taken to measure anterograde amnesia. RA was estimated by using test items that covered either the three decades (A. B. and L. J. ) or the four decades (E. P. and G. T. ) preceding the onset of amnesia. Scores from items that assessed anterograde memory func- tion for each patient were averaged together, and scores from items that assessed retrograde memory function for each patient were averaged together. The test scores of control subjects (five matched to A. B. , four matched to L. J. , and four matched to E. P. and G. T. ) were assigned to anterograde and retrograde time periods in the same manner as the scores of the patients to whom they were matched. Given the small number of patients that we have studied, it should be noted that the statistical methods we have used necessarily have low power. Because of this limitation, we occasionally have pointed out certain qualitative features of the data. Thus, it will be important to confirm these findings with additional patients as they become available. RESULTS Patients with hippocampal formation lesions The mean scores of A. B. and L. J. , the two patients with hip- pocampal formation lesions, and their controls on eight tests are presented in Figure 3. On the New Vocabulary recall test, the patients performed well on the baseline items (patients, 91. 7% correct; controls, 91. 7% correct) . On the recognition version, each patient missed one item, and the control subjects made no errors. The data from the two New Vocabulary tests in Figure 3 were submitted to a 2 (group) X 3 (time period) ANOVA, and Reed and Squire * Retrograde Amnesia J.

Encephalitis 1990 6 1990s 1980s 1970s 1960s 1950s Note. For each patient, test items from the decades indicated were taken to measure either anterograde amnesia (AA) or retrograde amnesia (RA) . RA was estimated by using test items that covered either the three decades (A. B. and L. J. ) or the four decades (E. P. and G. T. ) preceding the onset of amnesia. the data from the other six tests in Figure 3 were submitted to a 2 (group) X 4 (time period) ANOVA. There was an interaction of group X time period for the Famous Faces recognition test, with F (327) = 2. 97 and p < 0. 05, but there were no other significant findings, with F values < 2. 3 and p values > 0. 10. Individual tests at each time period of each test also revealed no significant group differences, with values < 2. 0 and p values > 0. 07. Nevertheless, on six of the eight tests the amnesic patients performed numerically more poorly than the control subjects for the period after they became amnesic, reflecting their antero- grade memory impairment. In contrast, for the period before they became amnesic, they performed similarly overall to the control subjects except on the Public Events Recognition test. To examine this pattern in the data further, we calculated each subject s median percentage correct score across all eight tests. Then the mean of these median scores was calculated for each group (Fig. 4) . A 2 (group) x 4 (time period) ANOVA revealed no group effect (F (; . 9, = 2. 27; p > 0. 15) but did reveal an interaction that approached statistical significance (F (3. 7) = 2. 6; p = 0. 07) . Further analysis of these data indicated that the amnesic patients were impaired significantly on items from their period of anterograde amnesia, with (9) = 2. 28 and p < 0. 05. Both patients exhibited low scores for this time period (A. B. , 71. 7%; L. J. , 72. 5%) . In contrast, they performed about as well as control subjects on items from the three time periods before they became amnesic, with values < 1. 2 and p values > 0. 10 (A. B. , 84. 0%; L. J. , 78. 7%) . This absence of measurable RA should be interpreted cautiously. For the period 1-10 years before amnesia, the mean score for the two patients was numerically below the control mean on five of the eight tests. It is therefore possible that some RA was present. If so, it was temporally limited and spanned <10 years. Performance on the AMI is shown in Figure 5. For the items assessing personal semantic knowledge, A. B. and L. J. scored overall approximately as well as control subjects. Note that 11 of the 13 items from the Recent Life time period inquired about the period of anterograde amnesia. A 2 (group) X 3 (time period) ANOVA revealed no significant effects, with F values < 1. 1 and p values > 0. 10. Examination of the individual data indicated that the patients generally performed well within the normal range at each of the three time periods. The single exception was that A. B. scored just below the lowest-scoring control subject on items from the Recent Life time period. All of LJ. s responses could be verified as accurate by family members. Patient A. B. provided inaccurate responses to two items from the Recent Life time period, and his score was adjusted from 19 to 17 points. His other responses were verified as accurate. For autobiographical memory, A. B. and L. J. performed poorly for the Recent Life time period and well for the two earlier time periods. In the case of autobiographical memory, all three items from the Recent Life time period inquired about the period of anterograde amnesia. A 2 (group) X 3 (time period) ANOVA revealed no significant effects, with F values < 1. 7 and p values > 0. 10. However, separate comparisons indicated that performance was impaired for the Recent Life time period, (9) = 2. 43 and p < 0. 04, with both patients scoring below all but one control subject. Performance was intact for the other two time periods, with values < 1. 0. All of A. B. s responses and all but one of L. J. s responses were verified as accurate. That one response, from her Early Adult time period, could not be classified as accurate or inaccurate by her family. Performance on the word association test of autobiographical memory is shown in Figure 6A. Each recollection was scored by using the 0-3 scale. The amnesic patients provided well formed episodic memories (scores =2. 5) in response to most of the 48 cue words (A. B. and L. J. each provided 40; the four controls averaged 39. 5 episodic memories) . For patient A. B. , 25 of these 40 mem- ories were verified as accurate by family members. The remaining 15 memories could not be identified as accurate or inaccurate. For patient L. J. , all autobiographical memories were verified as accurate by family members. In the analyses that follow, we included all of the patients recollections, except those identified as inaccurate. When we also excluded recollections that could not be identified as either accurate or inaccurate, the results were the same. A 2 (group) X 3 (retrograde time period) ANOVA revealed no significant effects; all F values were < 0. 8 (Fig. 6A) . Examination of the individual data indicated that the patients generally per- formed well within the normal range. The single exception was that A. B. scored below the lowest-scoring control subject for the Recent Life retrograde time period (mean, 2. 58 for A. B. ; mean, 2. 75 for the lowest-scoring control subject) . It is also of interest that, of the 10 recollections that he successfully produced from the Recent Life retrograde time period (maximum, 12) , nine of them were from the earliest three years of that period, 10-13 years before he became amnesic. Thus, A. B. exhibited evidence of ~10 years of RA for autobiographical memory. For each well formed autobiographical memory (scores =2. 5) , we also counted the number of prompts required before obtaining a successful episodic narrative (Fig. 6B) . Patient A. B. required more prompts than control subjects for the Recent Life (mean, 5. 1 for A. B. ; mean, 1. 1 for controls) and the Middle (mean, 4. 4 for A. B. ; mean, 1. 1 for controls) retrograde time periods but was within the range of controls for the Remote time period. Patient LJ. required more prompts than did the controls for the Middle retrograde time period (mean, 4. 2 for L. J. ; mean, 1. 1 for controls) but was within the range of controls for the Recent Life and Remote time periods. We next calculated the time that elapsed between the presen- tation of a cue word and the initiation of an episodic narrative 3948 J.

Performance of two amnesic patients (A. B. and L. J. ) with lesions of the hippocampal formation ( @ ) and nine control subjects (C O) on tests of fact knowledge. Anterograde amnesia (4A) was measured by performance on test items covering the period from 1970 to 1995 (for A. B. ) and from 1990 to 1995 (for L. J. ) . Retrograde amnesia (RA) was measured by performance on test items covering the period from 1940 to 1969 (for A. B. ) and from 1960 to 1989 (for L. J. ) . For their control subjects, test items were assigned to AA and RA time periods in the same way, i. e. , the data for five subjects were partitioned to match A. B. , and the data for four subjects were partitioned to match L. J. Performance on tests of recall is presented on the /eft, and performance on recognition tests is presented on the right. Chance levels of perfor- mance on the recognition tests were 25%, 25%, 41. 2%, and 33. 3% for the New Vocabulary, Public Events, Famous Faces, and Famous Names tests, respectively. (Fig. 6C) . Compared with control subjects, patient A. B. was slower to initiate episodic narratives for all time periods. Patient LJ. performed similarly to control subjects but was a little slower than control subjects for the Middle time period. A. B. s marked slowness in producing well formed recollections is in accord with our experience over the years. He is generally slow at motor and cognitive tasks.

To assess the autobiographical recollections qualitatively, we scored the content of each memory on the basis of previously scribed methods (Johnson et al. , 1988, 1997) (Fig. 7) . Each well formed autobiographical memory (a score of =2. 5) was scored for the amount of detail that subjects provided in 10 different cate- gories (people, places, actions, objects, spatial, emotional, tempo- ral, sensory-perceptual, cognitive, and factual/background) . The frequency with which each memory included details about each of these characteristics was rated on a seven-point scale (1 = min- imal detail; 7 = maximal detail) .

A 2 (group) X 3 (retrograde time period) x 10 (memory characteristic) ANOVA revealed a significant effect of memory characteristic, with F (y 35) = 35. 46 and p < 0. 001, indicating that there was a pattern to the content of the recollections. Subjects provided the most amount of detail regarding people, places, and actions and the least amount of detail concerning cognitive, spatial, and sensory-perceptual aspects of their memories. No other effects were significant, with F values < 1. 8 and p values > 0. 10. Thus, the amnesic patients exhibited the same pattern as the control subjects. Indeed, the amnesic patients scored within the range of the control subjects on all 10 memory characteristics. In summary, A. B. and LJ. exhibited anterograde memory impairment but limited RA. Significant RA for facts could not be detected, and if retrograde memory loss is present, it appears to be temporally limited and covers <10 years. A. B. exhibited RA for autobiographical episodes covering approximately the decade before the onset of his amnesia. L. J. did not exhibit detectable RA for autobiographical episodes. Patients with postencephalitic amnesia The mean scores of the two postencephalitic patients and their controls on eight tests are presented in Figure 8. The patients were impaired on both the recall and the recognition versions of the baseline items from the New Vocabulary test (41. 7% and 62. 5% correct for the patients; 95. 9% and 95. 8% correct for the controls; p values < 0. 05) . Thus, these two patients were impaired in accessing word meanings. The data from the New Vocabulary tests in Figure 8 were submitted to a 2 (group) X 4 (time period) ANOVA, and the data from the other six tests in Figure 8 were submitted to a 2 (group) x 5 (time period) ANOVA. The patients were impaired severely on every test (F values > 12. 0; p values < 0. 03) . Significant group X time period interactions were obtained for the New Vocabulary recognition test (F (3, ; 2) = 19. 4; p < 0. 001) and for the Famous Names Completion test (F (4, 15) = 6. 18; p < 0. 01) . On five of the eight tests (Public Events Recall and Recognition, Famous Faces Recall and Recognition, and Famous Names Recognition) , the patients performed at floor levels across all time periods. When they performed above floor levels, their retrograde mem- ory impairment for knowledge of events and people was similar to their memory impairment for general semantic knowledge (i. e. , word meanings) . Performance also was examined by calculating the average performance across the eight tests (Fig. 9) , using the same method that was used for the patients with hippocampal forma- tion lesions. The patients were severely impaired (F (, . 4) = 119. 3; 3950 J.

P. provided only 24 episodic autobiographical memories (ones that scored =2. 5) . Four of these were identified as inaccurate by family members. Of the remaining 20 memories, 15 were verified as accurate (0 from the Recent Life period, 3 from the Middle period, and 12 from the Remote period) . The remaining five memories could not be identified by family members as either accurate or inaccurate. Patient G. T. provided 18 episodic autobiographical memories, but 10 of these were identified as inaccurate. Of the remaining eight memories, four were identified as accurate (all from the Remote period) . The remaining four (two each from the Middle and Remote periods) could not be identified as either accurate or inaccurate. The scores obtained by E. P. and G. T. on the word association test of autobiographical memory were similar to their scores on the autobiographical portion of the AMI. Patient E. P. performed poorly for the Recent Life and Middle retrograde time periods (scores were 0. 8 and 1. 7, respectively; compare with Fig. 6A) . For the Remote retrograde time period, however, E. P. s score (2. 3) was within 2 SD of the control score (mean, 2. 7; SD = 0. 3) . Patient G. T. performed poorly in each retrograde time period Reed and Squire * Retrograde Amnesia Table 4. Childhood memories described by patient E. P. and a control subject (CON) Describe an incident from the period before you attended school. E. P. : When I was 5 years old, we moved from Oakland to the country. I was very excited and looked forward to the change. I remember the truck that dad rented. It was hardly full because we didn t have much furniture. When it was time to leave, mom got in the car and fol- lowed behind the truck. I rode in the truck with dad. CON: I remember the day that my older sister started school. I cried because I was the only one who wasn t going. I carried on so much that my mother got fed up and told my sister to take me with her to school. So I ended up starting school early. Describe an incident that occurred during the period in which you at- tended elementary school. E. P. : I was in second grade. I was playing in the schoolyard. I was run- ning, and I tripped and fell. I broke my arm. Mom came and took me to Dr. T. in downtown Hayward. He put a cast on my arm. I subjects scores. (1. 2, 1. 5, and 1. 5 for the Recent Life, Middle, and Remote time periods, respectively) . For the Remote retrograde time period in which E. P. per- formed relatively well, the number of prompts required before initiating his recollections (mean, 2. 0) was within the range of control subjects (1. 1 4. 2) . In addition, the time needed to initiate his recollections (2. 5 min) was within the range of control subjects (1. 6-5. 2 min) . Finally, E. P. s 16 memories from the Remote time period were scored for detail according to the same 10 memory characteristics used to evaluate the other patients. E. P. scored within the range of control subjects on all 10 characteristi vents from his early life (Fg. 10) Other neuropsychological tests Figure 11 shows performance on the Information and Vocabulary subscales of the WAIS-R NI and on the Boston Naming Test. The J. Neurosci. , May 15, 1998, 18 (10) : 3943-3954 3951 two patients with hippocampal formation lesions performed iden- tically to the controls on all of the tests ( values < 1. 0; p values > 0. 39) . The postencephalitic patients performed differently. E. P. s scores were within the normal range for both forms of the Infor- mation test, but G. T. scored >2 SD below control subjects on both forms. E. P. and G. T. also were impaired on both forms of the Vocabulary test, scoring >3 SD below the control subjects. This finding is consistent with their impaired baseline perfor- mance on the New Vocabulary tests. Finally, E. P. and G. T. both scored >5 SD below control subjects on the two forms of the Boston Naming Test. G. T. was more impaired than E. P. on these tests, presumably because his lesion includes much of the tempo- ral lobe, whereas E. P. s lesion does not extend as far laterally. DISCUSSION Patients with hippocampal formation lesions Patients A. B. and L. J. exhibited a discontinuity between premor- bid and postmorbid memory. They were impaired at remember- ing facts and events from the period after they became amnesic but were much better at remembering facts and events from the period before they became amnesic (see Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6) . These findings indicate that the brain structures damaged in these two patients are important for establishing new memories about facts and events but are less involved in recollecting memories that already were established several years earlier. This distinction between establishing new memories and recollecting old ones depends on having assessed the postmorbid and premorbid time periods with the same type of test item, as we did in the current study. Fact learning after hippocampal formation lesions Several studies have documented impaired learning of new facts and vocabulary words in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe lesions (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975; Schacter et al. , 1984; Glisky et al. , 1986; Shimamura and Squire, 1987; Gabrieli et al. , 1988; Hamann and Squire, 1995) . Other studies have reported that patients with medial temporal lobe lesions, in addition to their anterograde amnesia, also have difficulty recollecting factual information from the period before the onset of their amnesia (Corkin, 1984; Beatty et al. , 1987; Salmon et al. , 1988; Kopelman et al. , 1989; Squire et al. , 1989; Kartsounis et al. , 1995; Rempel- Clower et al. , 1996; Schmidtke and Vollmer, 1997) . The findings for A. B. and L. J. are consistent with previous reports in showing deficient acquisition of new factual knowledge about vocabulary, famous people, and public events. These two patients, together with the patient described by Kartsounis and colleagues (1995) , appear to be the only instances in which this point has been established for patients with lesions thought to be limited to the hippocampal formation. One other report described three children who sustained hippocampal damage early in life, who nevertheless attended mainstream schools and by the ages of 12-19 had acquired levels of factual knowledge in the low-average to average range (Vargha-Khadem et al. , 1997) . Because the rate of factual learning that occurred during childhood is unknown, the findings for these three individuals do not contradict the generalization that new fact learning is impaired by hippocampal pathology. Nevertheless, this report and others (Corkin, 1984; Glisky et al. , 1986; Hamann and Squire, 1995) emphasize the point that repetition, day after day and across multiple learning opportunities, in the fullness of time can provide amnesic patients with a considerable fund of factual knowledge. The present finding that A. B. and L. J. possess deficient factual knowledge 3952 J.

There are few standardized tests available, and knowledge does not accrue inevitably to normal levels in the face often the recollections cannot be validated. Finally, assessing the of hippocampal pathology. quality of autobiographical recollections is beset by the additional problem that anterograde amnesia may impede the reconstruc- tion of a past memory. That is, to the extent that recollecting the past requires an amnesic patient to hold material in working memory while engaging in strategic search, the task of reconstruc- tion might itself depend on anterograde memory function. Event memory after hippocampal formation lesions For patients with circumscribed medial temporal lobe lesions, several studies have reported RA for autobiographical material (Kopelman et al. , 1989; MacKinnon and Squire, 1989; Victor and Agamanolis, 1990; Kartsounis et al. , 1995; Rempel-Clower et al. , : . : an 1996; Schmidtke and Vollmer, 1997) . Some of these studies report ; In view of these difficulties, the key to understan ing similari- a general difficulty in producing autobiographical recollections, ties and differences in how RA presents itself lies in obtaining as and others describe impairments that are limited to the recent much information as possible about the underlying neuropathol- postmorbid period. One difficulty with this literature is that ithas Ogy. During the past 15 years four amnesic patients with hip- not been possible in many cases to determine the extent of the pocampal formation lesions came to autopsy, and their brains lesion or the likelihood that some damage has occurred outside were examined in considerable neurohistological detail (Zola- the medial temporal lobe (especially in cortex adjacent to the Morgan et al. , 1986; Rempel-Clower et al. , 1996) . All of the medial temporal lobe) . Another difficulty lies simply in the prob- patients had been evaluated formally with respect to anterograde lem of how to estimate the severity and extent of memory loss for and RA, using many of the same tests that were given to patients Reed and Squire * Retrograde Amnesia A. B. and L. J. Two of the patients (R. B. and G. D. ) proved to have bilateral lesions limited to the CA1 field of the hippocampus, and they had a moderate level of anterograde amnesia and RA limited to perhaps a few years at the most. The other two patients (L. M. and W. H. ) had lesions involving all of the hippocampal cell fields, the dentate gyrus, and some cell loss in the entorhinal cortex (as well as subicular damage for W. H. ) . L. M. had moderate anterograde amnesia and an estimated 15 years of RA. W. H. had severe anterograde amnesia and as many as 25 years of RA. The findings for A. B. and L. J. would appear to place them interme- diate in severity between R. B. and G. D. on the one hand, and L. M. and W. H. on the other. In the context of these findings, it is useful to consider another patient who had abnormal MRI signals in the CA1 and CA2 fields after a seizure and who was poor at producing autobiographical recollections from virtually every period of his adult life (Kart- sounis et al. , 1995) . Considering that this patient had a history of heavy drinking, pulmonary disease, and a history of cerebral ischemia and seizures, it seems unlikely that his damage could be limited to the CA fields of the hippocampus. Postmortem histo- logical analysis will be important in this case to determine the areas of damage. Although histological information is not available for the two patients reported here (A. B. and L. J. ) , it is noteworthy that they also were capable of accurate autobiographical recollections. Moreover, the recollections of these two patients exhibited the same pattern of characteristics as the recollections of control subjects (see Fig. 7) . These findings count against the suggestion that the hippocampal formation is needed to retrieve autobio- graphical memories throughout life (Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997) . The available data would appear to favor an earlier idea (Cohen and Squire, 1981) , recently articulated by Verfaellie and colleagues (1995) : . . . learning of any kind, whether it be epi- sodic or semantic, may be more impaired in amnesia when infor- mation was acquired recently rather than remotely (p 451) . Patients with postencephalitic amnesia The findings for these two patients are similar in some respects to previous reports of extensive, flat gradients of RA in posten- cephalitic amnesia [patient $. S. , Cermak and O Connor (1983) ; patient D. R. B. , Damasio et al. (1985) ; and patient R. F. R. , War- rington and McCarthy (1988) ]. Extensive remote memory im- pairment also has been described after temporal lobectomy (Barr et al. , 1990; Warrington and Duchen, 1992) or temporal lobe infarction (Schnider et al. , 1994) . In virtually all of these cases, as well as in patient G. T. , there is evidence of lateral temporal cortical damage in addition to medial temporal lobe pathology. A common interpretation of extensive, ungraded RA is that dam- age has occurred to knowledge stores, thereby affecting the ability to recollect information regardless of when it was learned (Kapur, 1993; Kapur et al. , 1996) . E. P. s RA was not so severe as G. T. s. His RA was severe and extensive, but unlike G. T. , E. P. was capable of considerable recall from his early life. Thus, unlike other patients with postenceph- alitic amnesia (e. g. , patients D. R. B. , S. S. , and R. F. R. ) who are described as incapable of episodic remembering, E. P. s narrative episodes from his early life contained the same kind of detail and structure as the narrative episodes recalled by our control subjects (Table 4) . Inevitably, the question arises whether the narratives produced by severely amnesic patients are true remembrances or whether they are drawn from a collection of a few over-rehearsed stories (cf. Cermak and O Connor, 1983) . In view of the fact that J. Neurosci. , May 15, 1998, 18 (10) : 3943-3954 3953 even recollections from healthy individuals often have this char- acter, it is unclear how to decide the point. E. P. does appear to be capable of autobiographical remembering, although we recognize that methods might yet be devised to show that his recollections are somehow impoverished or imperfect, in comparison with those of healthy persons. E. P. s severe and extensive RA is likely attributable to the fact that his lesion includes the medial temporal cortex (perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices) , not just the hippocampal forma- tion, and it also extends laterally from the medial temporal lobe to include the fusiform gyrus at some levels. At the same time, E. P. s residual capacity for very remote memory is probably attributable to the fact that his lesion did not extend as far into lateral temporal cortex as the lesion in G. T. or other patients with pervasive impairments of episodic remembering. Thus, it is pos- sible that damage in addition to the hippocampal formation that includes medial temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus is sufficient to cause severe and extensive RA. Such damage appears to spare both episodic and semantic remembering of facts and events from early life so long as the damage does not include more lateral temporal cortex. It is also worth noting that both E. P. and G. T. performed differently on the Famous Name Completion test and the Famous Names Recognition test than the postencephalitic patient R. F. R. (Warrington and McCarthy, 1988) . R. F. R. exhibited no deficit at all when tests about famous persons were redesigned to assess simple familiarity for names or name completion ability. E. P. and G. T. , as well as two patients studied previously (patient W. I. and patient D. R. B. ; Squire et al. , 1990) , improved their performance when the tests were administered in the revised format, but they remained distinctly impaired. The revised test was rather easy for R. F. R. , and ceiling effects might have obscured an impairment. Alternatively, the neuropathology responsible for R. F. R. s im- pairment may prove to be different in some important way from that of the other four patients who have been given these tests. In summary, the findings suggest that RA can be quite limited or very extensive, depending on whether the damage is restricted to the hippocampal formation or also involves additional tempo- ral cortex. At the same time, it must be emphasized that the number of patients with medial temporal lobe lesions or even larger temporal lobe lesions who have been studied carefully with respect to RA is small, and an even smaller number of patients have been studied postmortem to obtain neurohistological data about the extent of the lesion.

The test was administered first in a recall format in which subjects were presented with each photograph and asked to name the person (e. g. , Marilyn Monroe) . After the recall test was completed, the subjects were shown each unrecalled photograph and asked either a yes or no question [e. g. , Is this person s name Marilyn Monroe? (One-half of the time, the name that was presented was correct. ) ] or a three- alternative multiple choice question (e. g. , Which of the following is the name of this person? Gwen Verdon, Brigitte Bardot, or Marilyn Mon- roe) . The recognition score was based on the number of items that were recalled correctly plus the items that were recognized correctly. Note that chance performance on the recognition test was 41. 6% (the average of 50% and 33. 3%) . Famous names completion and famous names recognition. For the completion test, the subjects were given a list of 65 items, each consisting of a first name together with the first few letters of a last name (e. g. , J. Neurosci. , May 15, 1998, 18 (10) : 3943-3954 3945 Alfred Hitch ) . In each case they attempted to complete the item to form the name of a famous person. All of the correct completions corresponded to names of faces that had appeared on the Famous Faces test (1940s, n = 11; 1950s, n = 13; 1960s, n = 11; 1970s, n = 13; 1980s, n = 11; 1990s, n = 6) . For the recognition test, 70 test items were constructed, each consisting of three names (e. g. , Joseph Silva, Jimmy Hoffa, Willie Turman) . Subjects circled the name that they thought was the name of a famous person. The correct answers for the recognition test also corresponded to the names of faces from the Famous Faces test (1940s, n = 12; 1950s, n = 13; 1960s, n = 13; 1970s, n = 14; 1980s, n = 12; 1990s, n = 6) . There was no overlap in the items used for the completion test and the recognition test. The Famous Names tests were administered from 1 to 12 weeks after subjects had completed the Famous Faces test. Autobiographical memory interview (A MI) . The AMI (Kopelman et al. , 1989) is a structured interview that asks subjects to provide detailed information concerning three periods of their lives (i. e. , Childhood, Early Adult Life, and Recent Life) . Within each of these periods memory was tested for both personal semantic knowledge (e. g. , What was your home address while attending high school?) and autobiographical mem- ory (e. g. , Describe an incident that occurred while you were attending elementary wore it for 4 weeks. * CON: I was playing in the schoolyard swinging on a pole. The pole came down and hit a third grade girl that was playing nearby. It crushed her and she was out of school for the rest of the year. Describe an incident that occurred during the period in which you at- tended high school. E. P. : When I was 13, I got sick. I got all swollen. Mom drove me to Dr. T. s office. He said I had dropsy and said I had to stay in bed for a month. I was upset because I couldn t go out and play with my friends. I gave mom urine samples every day. She took them to the doctor s office to check for blood. * CON: In high school biology class, we took a field trip to the woods. It was during the spring. We went looking for plants to identify them.

The patient showed a profound retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events extending for about 10 years prior to the disease onset. Her knowledge about public events and famous persons was also impaired for this period. An MRI and SPECT demonstrated bilateral medial temporal pathology. This case represents a further instance of a relatively focal retrograde amnesia following brain damage. We review other reported cases with focal tetrograde/amnesia and consider theoretical and neuroanatomical accounts for the present case. Two factors may account for her amnesic patterns: a partial disruption of the store for premorbid binding codes (i. e. , information that multimodal feature representations occurred synchronously) ; along with a relative preservation of the encoding process required to develop new synchronous codes. Key words: amnesia, retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, hippocampus, medial temporal lobe INTRODUCTION Retrograde amnesia, the inability to retrieve events that occurred prior to the onset of brain damage, is typically accompanied by anterograde amnesia. Over the past two decades, however, focal or isolated retrograde amnesia (FRA) , i. e. , severe retorae. amn been reported (for reviews, see Kapur, 1993; De Renzi, Lucchelli, Muggia et al. , 1997) . These FRA cases are important for theories of amnesia and normal memory function because they provide evidence that retrograde and anterograde amnesia are caused by disruption of different cognitive processes that appear to be subserved by different neural substrates. In this paper, we report a post-encephalitic patient with a severe but temporally Jimited retrograde amnesia coupled with a relatively mild anterograde amnesia. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old right-handed (Edinburgh handedness inventory, 100) woman with a 12th-grade education. Her past medical history included lung tuberculosis at the age of 20 and 40, and an operation for uterine cancer at the age of forty-nine. There Cortex, (1999) 35, 599-614 600 Toshikatsu Fujii and Others was no previous neurological or psychiatric history. Four days before admission she had been febrile for a day. On the day of admission (7 May 1997) , she developed a generalized epileptic seizure. On admission, neurological examination was normal except for a mild disturbance of consciousness. Her cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytosis and a significant elevation of anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) antibodies. Intravenous acyclovir was started. Intermittent complex partial and generalized seizures were eventually controlled after four weeks. At this time she was well oriented to time, place and person, but a severe retrograde amnesia for events prior to the onset of the disease was revealed. Although she was able to relearn most of the past episodes of her life from her siblings, she complained to be unable to experience these events as her own personal experiences. NEURORADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION An MRI scan (1. 5-T, Signa, General Electric) of the brain was carried out on the 35th hospital day. Sagittal images were obtained to cover the whole brain. Then, axial images parallel to the Sylvian fissure with a slice thickness of 4. 3 mm were acquired. Last, oblique coronal images, vertical to the axial plane, with a slice thickness of 4. 3 mm were obtained. T2-weighted images (Figure 1) revealed abnormal high intensity areas in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, including the anterior two thirds of the hippocampal formation (hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum) and the posterior part of the amygdala. The posterior part of the hippocampal formation, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal pole seemed to be spared.

Disproportionate retrograde amnesia 601 SPECT using N-isopropyl (!?I) -P-iodoamphetamine carried out on the 41st hospital day showed a diminution of regional blood flow in bilateral anterior medial temporal lobe regions. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Neuropsychological assessment was carried out between days 28 and 52. General Cognitive Testing The main results of the standard neuropsychological tests administered are shown in Table I. In conversation, comprehension was normal, but there was a mild word finding difficulty which was reflected in relatively low scores on the verbal fluency test. The scores on the demonstrated her TABLE I Patient s Performance on General Cognitive Testing Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised Full IQ 89 Verbal IQ 84 Performance IQ 96 Scaled Scores Information 6 Digit Span 6 Vocabulary 7 Arithmetic 6 Comprehension 11 Similarities 9 Picture Completion 9 Picture Arrangement 9 Block Design 11 Object Assembly 10 Digit Symbol 9 Mini Mental State Test 29/30 Token Test (shortened version; De Renzi and Faglioni, 1978) 33/36 100 Pictures Naming 94/100 Raven PM 34/36 Kohs Cube Test 1Q 115 Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (shortened version; Nelson, 1976) 4 categories with 48 cards Verbal Fluency Animals 8 A 7 Fu 6 Ni 2 = 5 modified form of the Corsi Block Tapping Test (Milner, 1971) , was six. Two tests were used to evaluate her verbal and spatial working 602 Toshikatsu Fujii and Others memory: Lag | digit span (Dobbs and Rule, 1989) in which the patient had to subtract one from each digit presented orally and report the resulting sequence (e. g. , when given 7, 9, 4, the patient has to respond 6, 8, 3) and a Corsi type tapping test which demanded repetition of the patterns immediately after 90 degrees rotation. Her performance was five for both the verbal and the spatial working memory tests. Her performances on these tasks were normal. Anterograde Memory Table II summarizes the results on standard learning tests. On the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, the patient s MQ was 93, which was superior to her FIQ of 89 on the WAIS-R. Clinical observations suggested that she could learn new information fairly well. For example, she was able to recall what her siblings and hospital staffs had told her, as well as what she had seen on TV or read in newspapers. She did not have difficulty in recognizing doctors and was able to give information about the examinations she had undergone.

She never produced confabulatory responses to our questions. (1) A Structured Interview on Autobiographical Memory The patient s autobiographical memory was assessed by means of a structured interview covering past personal experiences. Items selected for this Disproportionate retrograde amnesia 603 interview were based on information obtained from an interview with the patient s closest sister with whom the patient had regular monthly contact. Items covered the following categories: towns and houses in which she had lived, educational and occupational experiences, trips, hospital treatments, births, weddings, and deaths of her relatives Some examples of the results are given below. Towns and Houses. She was able to describe accurately the six towns in which she had lived until the age of 25 and the town in which she had been living since age 25. She was also able to draw a rough sketch of a condominium which she and her husband had bought 17 years ago. However, she was unable to remember that they had sold it and moved to a new condominium two years ago. She could not recall her present address and telephone number despite the fact that she could remember the address and the telephone number of her previous home. Educational and Occupational Experiences. She could recall facts related to elementary and senior high school. She could remember scenes of plays with her brother, episodes of school outings, and the routes to the schools. She could recall the names of her supervisors and coworkers with whom she had worked in her early 20s, and the external shape of a building in which she had worked. Trips. She had virtually no memory of the many trips she had taken with her husband or siblings over the past five years. We could not collect certain information about her previous trips. Hospital Treatments. While she was able to remember the two episodes of pulmonary tuberculosis from which she suffered 31 and 11 years ago, she was unable to recall an operation for uterine cancer that had occurred just two years ago. Birth, Weddings, and Deaths of Her Relatives. She could recall correct name and age of her six siblings and 10 nephews/nieces. She could not remember her father s onset of hemiparesis and his subsequent hospitalization that happened 10 years ago. She was unable to remember her father s death and funeral which occurred seven years ago. She could not remember her husband s death and funeral half a year ago. She had no memories about three wedding parties which she attended one, two and five years ago respectively. Other Experiences. When she was asked about a big earthquake which happened 20 years ago, she answered I might have experienced it but don t remember . Later she remembered the chaos in the house caused by the quake. 604 Toshikatsu Fujii and Others On the (Kopelman, Wilson and Baddeley, 1990) , her scores on ere 12, 17, and four for childhood, early adult life, and recent life sections, respectivelt She showed because her recollections were sketchy and not elaborate. Her scores for recent life both on personal semantic memory and autobiographical incidents reflected her anterograde memory capacity because this part includes the question about present hospitalization. (2) Memory for Public Events We prepared a questionnaire about public events that had occurred prior to the onset of the disease by modifying the test devised by Fukatsu, Fujii, Sato et al. (1994) . The questionnaite consisted of 16 questions per decade, from 1950 to 1997. It was given in a recognition form with four choices per question. The performance of the patient and 10 age- and education-matched control subjects (mean age 49. 4, mean education 13. 7) are compared in Figure 2. Her correct scores for each decade starting from the 50 s through the 90 s were 13, 12, 10, 12, and 10 respectively. The mean numbers of correct answers and the SD of the control subjects for the same decades were 13. 1 (3. 0) , 13. 2 (2. 0) , 12. 8 r Patient OD Controls 16 n 3 e fy 3 e e o 8 je} 1S) 1950 s 1960's 1970's 1980's 1990's Decade Fig. 2 Performance of the patient and control subjects on the Public Event Test.

The scores for the other decades were within the normal range (within two SDs) . (3) Dead or Alive Test We also assessed the patient s retrograde amnesia with a modified version of the Dead or Alive test (Kapur, Young, Bateman et al. , 1989) adapted for the Japanese population. The test consisted of 40 items. For each of the four decades starting from 60 s through 90 s, eight famous persons were selected who had died during that decade (32 items) . Eight buffer items consisted of eight living persons. The patient and five age- and education-matched control subjects (mean age 49. 2, mean education 13. 6) were requested to indicate whether a famous personality was dead or alive and, if they thought the person was dead, when he/she had died (in 5-year bands) . The test score related only to individuals who had died. Two points were allotted for each correct dead judgment. If the answer was incorrect, zero was allotted. A further two points were added if the subjects could correctly indicate the time of the death within one 5-year band-width. Thus for each decade, the maximum score was 32.

DISCUSSION This post herpes encephalitis patient demonstrated a disproportionately severe retrograde amnesia, which contrasted with a rather mild anterograde amnesia. Her ability to acquire and retrieve new information in everyday life was fairly well preserved, although not perfect. Formal testing corroborated this clinical observation. In contrast, she showed a profound retrograde amnesia for autobiographical episodes and facts extending for about 10 years prior to the disease onset. She showed a mild word aa deficit in aa conversation. An MRI and SPECT demonstrated This case represents a further instance that a relatively focal retrograde amnesia can occur as a residual of brain damage. The Extent of FRA and Its Etiology Compared with traumatic brain injury, encephalitis as a cause of FRA is relatively rare. Tables II] and IV summarize reported cases of FRA in terms of their etiologies. Excluding three cases of unknown etiology (Andrews, Poser and Kessler, 1982; Stuss and Guzman, 1988; Dalla Barba, Mantovan, Ferruzza et al. , 1997) , there are seven post encephalitic cases including the present one, two transient global amnesia cases, an anoxia case, and a vasculitis case (Table III) . On the other hand, there are 20 cases following traumatic brain injury (Table IV) . FRA with non-traumatic etiologies tends to have temporally limited amnesia. Only one case of postencephalitic FRA showed amnesia covering the whole life (O Conner, Butters, Miliotis et al. , 1992) . This case had extensive damage to the temporal lobe with some extension to the parietal lobe, posterior ventromedial frontal region in the right hemisphere, and damage to the parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and posterior ventromedial frontal region in the left hemisphere. Two cases of FRA secondary to encephalitis had FRA extending for 20 to 30 (Calabrese, Markowitsch, Durwen et al. , 1996) and 20 (Carlesimo, Sabbadini, Loasses et al. , 1998) years. Lesions in these two cases were smaller than those of O Connor et al. s case, but larger than those of the remaining four encephalitic cases with shorter temporal extent. In the present case, dense FRA extended over a decade and the lesions were smaller than those of the three cases with longer FRAs. The FRA of Hokkanen, Launes, Vataja et al. s case (1995) covered several years and that of Yoneda, Yamadori, Mori et al. s case (1992) extended only one years. The MRI of these last two cases revealed no structural cerebral damage, but SPECT did indicate decreased blood flow in the 607 Disproportionate retrograde amnesia yeyoued = g yendios0 = O [euoy = J spesodwiay = PIS = 2Y Yo] = FT Pesoywepiq = |g Surpuyy ou = ersouwe opesiSonal = yy visouWe opesSoNar [Roo] = YY eIsouue jeqoys yusIsueN = YOL smijeydoous = NY SII - (LOAdS) d-L VTA TA (AA) OUT L VT Aydone ojod Eq YT Ta = steak Op-0 ~ - 19 SHTNOSeA, (9661) Te 19 sueag 801 (dd) L Jouaisod 1g = YP SOUL OZ BEXOUW ( 66T) HloYyoonT pure Izuey oq IIT 911 - steak 0-07 bl VOL (6861) Te 30 dey 611 801 = steak QI-S 9 VOL (0861) \"Ie 19 sodureD-uewi0y 68 6 (LOAdS) L [erpew 11g (TAA) L Tetpew 1 sak Ql I Na (Apnas sip) pe 39 wfney 88 68 - (TAIN) Fonew oy d-O-L smeok QZ 67 Na (8661) Te 19 OWTsapeD LOL 9IT = = sok Z 67 Na (L661) Te 39 vreyTYsy Ol 6 (LOddS) A-L Va (TAIN) V1 <M LTE sreok 0 -0% oS Na (9661) I? 19 asarqeeD SIT 611 (LOAdS) L oIPprw-so1rojue YT smok [eIoaes Na (S661) Te 19 UoURs}OH el - (LOAdS) L sovasod 1T - woaAkT 17 Na (Z661) Te 19 epouOX 78 +8 (LO TAIN) A etpomonuea EIT < TAL A YUM 97 Na (Z661) Te 10 10UU0D.

Ishihara, Ichikawa, Takeuchi et al. (1997) reported an encephalitic patient with a two year FRA, but no abnormalities were revealed with imaging studies. It seems likely that, at least for cases with encephalitis, the extent of FRA is related to the extent of their damage. In contrast, FRA secondary to traumatic brain injury appears to be more extensive in its duration. In at least 15 out of the 20 patients who had FRA secondary to traumatic brain injury, FRA extented to their entire pre-injury life. In traumatic cases, there is no consistent relation between the extent of FRA and the lesion size, or the presence or absence of lesions detected by imaging studies. For instance, the patients reported by Maravita, Spadoni, Mazzucchi et al. (1995) , De Renzi, Lucchelli, Muggia et al. (1995) , and De Renzi et al. (1997) had minor traumatic brain injury and no detectable lesions, and yet showed severe FRA covering their entire life. In contrast, FRA was temporally limited in the patients described by Goldberg, Antin, Bilder et al. (1981) and Mattioli, Grassi, Perani et al. (1996) , who suffered from severe traumatic brain injury and had detectable lesions. However, a relatively young age of onset in traumatic cases might mask the temporal gradient (O Connor et al. , 1992; De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993) . Possible Mechanisms of FRA FRA patients cannot retrieve premorbid experiences that was normally encoded, yet they are able to postmorbid episodes, provided we make the assumption that the process involved in producing codes for synchronicity of information is separate from that devoted to their storage. If the same neural substrate were utilized for both processes, their damage would 610 Toshikatsu Fujii and Others also result in anterograde amnesia for postmorbid events. Selective damage only to the stores of binding codes would lead to the FRA. If damage to the stores of binding codes dealing with premorbid episodes is complete, FRA would cover the whole life. If it is partial, FRA would be temporally limited as in the present case. Along this framework, O Connor et al. (1992) surmised that their patient s FRA was attributable to the extensive damage both to the right and the left parahippocampal regions, where binding codes necessary for the retrieval of remote information are supposed to be stored. An alternate view is that damage to the pathways connecting binding codes with feature representations has the same effect as the disruption of the binding codes themselves. This hypothesis could account for the FRA of Carlesimo et al. s patient (1998) who had damage to the white matter in bilateral temporo- occipito-parietal lobes and showed temporally limited retrograde amnesia and relatively preserved ability to learn new information. This hypothesis may be applicable to patients with temporally limited FRA with subcortical or posterior cortical lesions, but not to cases with FRA covering the whole life, because it is difficult to believe that complete damage to the pathways would leave new learning intact. Certainly this view cannot explain the present case who had neither subcortical nor posterior cortical lesions. A related but different theory proposes that brain damage may cause a distortion (Lucchelli, Muggia and Spinnler, 1995) or an elevation of the threshold (Della Sala, Freschi, Lucchelli et al. , 1996; De Renzi et al. , 1997) of the patterned matrices, but leave engrams themselves and machinery for storing and retrieving new information undamaged. In fact, the traumatic FRA of Lucchelli et al. s (1995) case 2 and the total FRA of Stuss and Guzman s (1988) patient cleared suddenly, leaving no detectable residual deficits. This hypothesis can account for FRA after mild traumatic brain injury. Other authors claim that it is not the disruption of binding codes but that of feature representations which is responsible for FRA. Ogden s (1993) patient showed a retrograde amnesia which was accompanied by visual deficits and loss of visual imagery after bilateral medial occipital lesions. Based on Damasio s (1989) framework, Ogden postulated that the patient s autobiographical memory loss was a result of his inability to retrieve long-term visual memories (see Rubin and Greenberg, 1998) . Evans et al. (1996) similarly argued that FRA was caused by the destruction of representations of consolidated memories or of critical intracortical connections. These explanations seems implausible because it is unlikely that damage to feature representations can cause severe FRA and at the same time leave intact not only the functioning of semantic memories, forebrain amnesia who showed a pure retrieval deficit, retrieval recovered for both information acquired before and after the onset of infarct (Fukatsu, Yamadori and Fujii, 1998) . To sum up, a partial disruption of stores of binding codes formed premorbidly and a relative preservation of the encoding process for new binding codes is the most plausible hypothesis to account for the present patient s amnesia, i. e. , severely impaired retrieval of episodes covering 10 years predating the disease onset, and relatively preserved encoding and retrieval of episodes that occurred after the disease. Alternatively, a deficit in consolidation process can explain her amnesic profile if we assume that the consolidation activity remains active as long as 10 years. Neuroanatomical Consideration The present patient had lesions in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, as evidenced by both MRI and SPECT studies. It was hard to determine more precise lesion sites in this type of cerebral pathology. In this regard it is interesting to note that most reports of FRA come from traumatic brain injury or encephalitis, suggesting that multifocal (and probably bilateral) lesions are necessary for patients to manifest FRA (Markowitsch, 1995; Kapur, 1997) . As shown in Table III, four of the patients with encephalitis, including the present case, had bilateral temporal lobe damage. The remaining two cases showed an abnormality in the left temporal lobe on SPECT. Evans et al. s (1996) case with a vasculitis showed structural damage to the left temporal lobe and De Renzi and Lucchelli s (1993) case with an anoxia showed some evidence of bilateral temporal pathology on PET. Among the patients with traumatic brain injury who had relatively circumscribed damage (see Table IV) , seven out of 13 cases showed damage in the temporal lobes and one showed bilateral reduction of metabolism in the medial temporal lobe by PET. Researchers who have reported FRA in patients with lesions not encroaching upon the temporal lobes (Odgen, 1993; Hunkin et al. , 1995; Levine et al. , 1998) have stressed the role played by damage to the connection between the lesions and the temporal lobes. Thus it is likely that the dysfunction of the temporal lobes is a prerequisite for the development of FRA. If this is the case, there must be a distinction amongst specific temporal lobe regions concerning encoding, storage, or retrieval processes. 612 Toshikatsu Fujii and Others The present patient showed damage relatively restricted to the bilateral hippocampal formations, with possible sparing of the posterior part of the bilateral hippocampi. The temporal pole, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus appeared to be undamaged bilaterally on MRI. Bilateral damage of CA1 of the hippocampus is known to produce moderately severe anterograde amnesia with minimal retrograde amnesia, while bilateral damage extending beyond CAI region, but still limited to the hippocampal formation, can produce more severe anterograde amnesia along with extensive temporally graded retrograde amnesia covering 15 years or more (Zola-Morgan, Squire and Amaral, 1986; Rempel-Clower, Zola, Squire et al. , 1996; Squire and Zola, 1996) . Reed and Squire (1998) also reported two cases with lesions in the bilateral hippocampal formation who showed anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia limited to the decade preceding the onset of amnesia. The two other patients with more extensive damage beyond the hippocampal formation had severe anterograde amnesia and more extensive retrograde amnesia. From these results, it can be inferred that the CA1 region of the hippocampus is important for memory encoding but contributes little to retrieval of remote memories. As to the roles of the remaining parts of the hippocampal formation and adjacent temporal cortices, we can advance two hypotheses. One is that the remaining parts of the hippocampal formation and the adjacent temporal cortex are involved both in encoding and storage/retrieval. The other is that these areas are mainly specialized for storage/retrieval. Both assumptions can explain the findings of Squire and his colleagues because additional storage/retrieval deficits can enhance anterograde amnesia (see Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997) . Yoneda, Mori, Yamashita et al. (1994) , based on the study of amnesia following herpes simplex encephalitis, also suggested that anterograde amnesia is related to the reduced hippocampal volume, while retrograde amnesia is related to the atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus. Therefore, for FRA to occur, the encoding function of either hippocampus should be maintained. Many authors also emphasized the importance of the integrity of either hippocampus in cases with FRA (Kapur, Ellison, Smith et al. , 1992; O Connor et al. , 1992; Markowitsch, Calabrese, Liess et al. , 1993; Hunkin et al. , 1995; Evans et al. , 1996; Kroll, Markowitsch, Knight et al. , 1997; Carlesimo et al. , 1998; Levine et al. , 1998) . In the present case, although damage to the hippocampus (MRI) and hypoperfusion in the medial temporal region (SPECT) existed, we would like to consider that encoding process of either hippocampus must have functioned relatively well. In fact, the patient s ability to learn new information was not totally normal, which can be attributable to a certain degree of dysfunction of the hippocampal encoding system. But possible bilateral medial temporal lobe damage within or adjacent to the hippocampal formation must somehow have contributed to the disruption of stores for binding codes. Acknowledgements.

What mechanisms can explain this unique pattern of amnesia? In the following discussion, the possible mechanisms underlying FRA will be discussed with reference to the processes of encoding, storage, and retrieval, although in at least some of the traumatic patients without evidence of brain damage, FRA is due to a psychogenic or functional mechanism. Encoding deficit can be confidently ruled out as a cause of FRA in the present case because her amnesia developed acutely after the encephalitis and there was no evidence that she had any memory deficits prior to it. According to current views (Teyler and Discenna, 1986; Damasio, 1989; Kapur, 1997) , two different aspects of the information related to an episode must be stored to ensure its successful retrieval: the multimodal representations of the episode and the information that these representations occurred synchronously. The latter was named binding codes (Damasio, 1989) , index (Teyler and Discenna, 1986) or index codes (Kapur, 1997) . Nadel and Moscovitch (1997) also distinguished index from feature information of episodes. If these hypotheses are correct, we can separate at least three kinds of memory engrams, ie. , feature representations, binding codes, and connecting pathways between the two, which also are regarded as a kind of memory engram in the sense that an association between the two is encoded and retained for later retrieval. The disruption of binding codes can adequately account both for impaired retrieval of premorbid episodes and preserved retrieval of but also the capacity to learn new information (De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993; Hunkin et al. , 1995) . Another explanation of FRA as a storage dysfunction is the consolidation deficit theory proposed by De Renzi and Lucchelli (1993) who reported an anoxic case of FRA with abnormal forgetting rate. Maravita et al. (1995) reported a similar case following mild traumatic brain injury. Problems inherent to the consolidation theory concerns the extent of FRA (Evans et al. , 1996; Hunkin, 1997) . This theory may be applicable to cases with relatively short extent of FRA, but it cannot explain FRA of longer duration or covering the Disproportionate retrograde amnesia 6ll entire life, unless we assume consolidation continues over decades. The present patient showed the extent of FRA of about 10 years and a low delayed memory index on the WMS-R. If consolidation is assumed to last this long, this explanation is consistent with the present case. Finally, we must consider the possibility of a retrieval deficit as a cause of FRA. As some researchers pointed out (De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1993; Della Sala et al. , 1996) , it is implausible that damage to the retrieval process itself is so selective as to affect premorbid information only without damaging newly learned postmorbid information, unless we male the unlikely assumption that there are different retrieval systems for premorbid and postmorbid information (Maravita et al. , 1995; Levine, Black, Cabeza et al. , 1998) .

Received 22 August 1994 and in revised form 7 March 1995 Accepted 10 March 1995 Bilateral lesions of CA1l and CA2 fields of the hippocampus are sufficient to cause a severe amnesic syndrome in humans LD Kartsounis, P Rudge, J M Stevens Abstract A patient is reported in whom a classic amnesic syndrome developed as a result of repeated episodes of cerebral ischaemia, accompanied by seizures. The amnesia was very severe for both old and newly acquired memories and the critical lesions defined by MRI were cir- cumscribed areas confined to CA1 and CA2 fields of both hippocampi. (F Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1995; 59: 95-98) Keywords: amnesic syndrome; lesions of CAl and CAI hippocampal fields In its classic manifestation the amnesic syn- drome includes severe anterograde amnesia and variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. The study of its anatomical correlates has been problematical due to different brain areas being reported as damaged and the vari- ation in the ways neurobehavioural data, often inadequate, had been obtained, in different case reports. Neuropathological studies have generally suggested, however, that the critical lesions are in the medial temporal structures, particularly in the hip- pocampus and amygdala, in diencephalic regions that is, the dorsal medial thalamic nuclei and the mamillary bodies. As the hip- pocampus and the amygdala have rich con- nections with the diencephalon, it has been suggested that in diencephalic amnesia, path- ways to and from the medial temporal areas are affected. '? That the hippocampus plays a critical part in the acquisition of memories is supported by findings suggesting that the severity of memory impairment correlates with the extent of hippocampal resection in patients undergoing surgery for intractable epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging tech- niques now provide direct in vivo evidence on critical brain structures in human amnesia and an earlier report identified hippocampal abnormalities in three amnesic patients. * These data, however, merely showed a reduc- tion in the total size of the hippocampus and did not precisely define the areas involved. It remains unclear what parts of the hippocam- pus are crucial to memory. Furthermore, there is no consensus in the neurophysiologi- cal literature as to whether both anterograde and retrograde amnesia may result from hip- pocampal damage or only anterograde mem- ories are affected. We report a patient in whom a classic amnesic syndrome developed and show that the critical lesions defined by MRI were specific, circumscribed areas of both hippocampi. Case report The patient is a 67 year old retired seaman with chronic obstructive airways disease. He has a 30 year history of migraine. He used to drink fairly large amounts of alcohol but not in recent years, confirmed by his wife. In September 1993, after two similar episodes, he developed an apparent migraine attack, had a major convulsion, and was noted to have a_ supraventricular tachycardia that required DC conversion. Two days later he was alert and cooperative but he had a pro- found memory disturbance. At no time before this illness had he had amnesic episodes. Laboratory investigations, including liver function tests, full blood count, venereal disease research laboratory tests, and serum B12, as well as angiography and CT, were normal. Brain MRI in the sagittal and hori- zontal planes was normal, but coronal sec- tions through the temporal lobes showed abnormal signals from the hippocampi, con- fined to CA1 and CA2 fields, more so on the left. Some of the nuclei of the left amygdala were also involved (figure) . The mamillary bodies and the thalamus were not involved. The abnormalities on MRI were interpreted as lamina necrosis. The patient s verbal IQ on the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS-R) > was 99 and performance IQ 111, the first being only slightly below his estimated optimal level of functioning. His language and visual percep- tual skills were normal and he performed well on tests of frontal lobe executive function. His scores on recognition memory tests were at a defective level. His immediate recall of a short story and of designs * were below nor- mal limits and, on a 10 minute delayed recall he failed to reproduce a single idea. It has been shown that amnesic patients can per- form well on perceptual learning tasks involv- ing verbal or pictorial material ' and, as expected, his performance was competent. Thus on a variety of anterograde memory 96 (A; B) Two consecutive coronal MR images (slice thickness 5 mm, interslice space 2-5 mm, Signa 1-5 T imager, TR 2000, TE effective 20) through anterior part of body of hippocampus.

The table gives a summary of his per- formance on memory tests. In response to questions about his back- ground, he consistently referred to events of his distant past. In particular, he talked of his service in the navy several decades ago and his youth. He was able to give a good account of how he met his wife when he was aged 20. For the most part he described well his wed- ding in his early 20s but transposed to it inac- curate details that related to his sister s wedding in the 1950s. He was reported to Summary of memory test results Anterograde memory: Recognition tests Words: Poa faces: 32/50 (< 5th percentile) Recall tests Story: immedstes recall: below normal limits Delayed recall: 0 Designs: as for story Retrograde memory: Autobiographical memory interview Personal Semantic: 31 (max 63) Incidents: 12 (max 27) Galton-Crovitz technique Poor performance (see text) Family photographs Recognition of faces in: 7/17 Content identification in: 1/17 Public remote memory: Patient Naming current famous faces (n = 15) 2 Identifying world famous people by their names (n = 15) 1 Identifying major events of the past 30 years by name (n = 10) 1 Famous faces (1970s, 1980s) Triplets (3 x n = 15) Naming Patient 1970s 0 10-2 (1-3) 1980s (i) 2 11-8 (2-9) 1980s (ii) 2 8-5 (3-2) Kartsounis, Rudge, Stevens have been very close to his stepfather and his uncle, who had both died in the 1970s. When asked to talk of the death of his closest rela- tive, however, he referred to the death of a friend of the same age as himself at the age of 14. To the question about his last holiday with his wife, which took place in 1989, he referred to a holiday they had taken 40 years previously. On various other structured ques- tionnaires of retrograde memory, probing both autobiographical and public remote memory, his performance was similarly very poor (table) .

On an autobiographical questionnaire of semantic memory and incidents since childhood auto- biographical memory _ interview\"! his responses were unsatisfactory in both aspects of the test. Using the Galton-Crovitz tech- nique ? he was asked to describe unique episodes of his life relating to each of 10 high frequency nouns such as plant , pen , and camera . In response to eight of these words he referred to episodes of his childhood or youth; he seemed unable to retrieve any event relating to the remaining two words. His ability to identify people and events in family photographs was severely impaired. He had great difficulty in identifying or naming con- temporary famous people including politi- cians, royalty, and entertainers. When provided with the forename and the first letter of the surname of each of these faces, he was able to name about half of them. In a different session the same cueing method was used without showing him the pho- tographs of these famous people and he again named about half but could hardly provide any other identifying information. He was gravely impaired in identifying world famous people (for example, Nelson Mandela, Saddam Hussein) by their names; given a choice of three alternative occupations for each of these people he recognised more than half of them but was unable to provide any further correct identifying information. In a further task each of 45 famous faces of the 1970s and 1980s (EK Warrington, personal communication) was presented together with two non-famous distractor faces and he was able to select the famous from each triplet in most cases (familiarity responses) . He was unable to name any face from the 1970s, however, and only very few from the triplets of the 1980s. He could provide only limited identifying information for three or four famous faces of each set of triplets (for con- trols, about 12 faces were identified from each set) . He could say little about and often produced inaccurate information about major world events of the past few decades such as the Vietnam war. Except for one, he was unable to give any accurate infor- mation regarding 10 major events of the past two decades with British interest (for example, the Falklands war and_ the Lockerbie disaster) . Finally he was assessed on a test of new vocabulary by asking him to name pho- tographs of 15 modern items such as a video camera and a compact disc; he was able to name only two (controls named 13-7 (SD) 0-8) . By contrast, he was able to name pictures depicting historical figures or major world landmarks such as King Canute and the Parthenon\"; he named 21 out of 30 items correctly (controls named 20: 32 (SD 5-8) ) . Thus whereas his ability to recall fac- tual knowledge with which he had become familiar at a young age (semantic memory) was well preserved, he could retrieve few new concepts or new vocabulary (in a sense new semantic memory ) . Bilateral lesions of CA1 and CA2 fields of the hippocampus are sufficient to cause a severe amnesic syndrome in humans 97 Discussion Our patient failed on a comprehensive series of verbal and non-verbal, anterograde, and retrograde memory tests, in the context of well preserved intellectual skills. In common with other severely amnesic patients'* apart from benefiting to a certain degree by cueing effects and in doing so showing implicit learning , no dissociations or fractionations in his memory skills were seen. The localised hippocampal damage after repeated cardiac arrest could be the result of ischaemia coupled with a high energy require- ment due to concurrent epilepsy. It is known that CAl and CA2 fields are especially vul- nerable to ischaemic damage' and it is tempting to speculate that this is due to the high concentration of glutamine and excita- tory glutaminergic synapses in this area. Ischaemia might cause glutamine release as a result of energy failure in cells containing glu- tamine; stimulation of glutaminergic synapses could then cause the epileptic discharge, thus enhancing the energy requirements of the tis- sue and ultimately cytotoxicity due to exces- sive excitation. ' '7 The notion that stimulation of glutamate receptors can cause hippocampal damage, especially in CAI, is supported by postmortem data from patients in whom an amnesic state was induced by domoic acid. '* Our study shows that both severe antero- grade and retrograde amnesia may occur with isolated bilateral CAl and CA2 damage (see later discussion on left amygdalar involve- ment) . There has been a previous report of selective bilateral damage to CA] areas of the hippocampus on postmortem examination. ' The patient in that report, however, was sig- nificantly impaired on anterograde memory tasks but showed little, if any, retrograde amnesia. More generally, in all published rel- evant neuropathological and surgical, individ- ual, or group studies, good evidence for both anterograde and retrograde memory impair- ment is lacking, or there are fairly extensive lesions outside the hippocampi, or the precise hippocampal areas involved are not defined. * 19 20 Apart from the hippocampus, in our patient the basal nuclei of the left amygdala were damaged but this damage is unlikely to be relevant for at least three reasons. Firstly, lesions of the amygdala that spare adjacent cortical regions do not impair memory or exacerbate the impairment after lesions of the hippocampal formation in monkeys. ?! Such findings indicate that the hippocampal struc- tures comprise the critical component of the medial temporal memory system. Secondly, with regard to human amnesia, Scoville and Milner? found that, if the resections in epileptic patients spared the hippocampus and included only the uncus and amygdala, no discernible impairment of memory occurred. Thirdly, the right amygdala in our patient was not damaged and yet his visual memory was as impaired as his verbal mem- ory, visual memory being subserved by the right hemisphere. It thus seems unlikely that 98 the amygdalar lesion was relevant to the impairment of memory in this patient. A note of caution in interpreting our find- ings should be added. Detailed MRI showed damage limited to the hippocampi and left amygdala. Subtle histological changes in other areas or remote hypoactivation effects of the hippocampal infarcts, particularly with regard to adjacent cortical areas and the mamillothalamic system, cannot, however, be excluded. Nevertheless, this case study pro- vides strong evidence of severe memory impairment due to circumscribed structural damage of the hippocampi and this finding has not been previously reported.

However, controversies remain regarding the relationship between the extent of damage and the nature of the memory deficit. These include issues of whether or not amnesia can result from unilateral temporal lobe damage and the role of an intact hippocampus in the retrieval of memories that are still preserved. ?+ I report a patient who de- veloped severe amnesia for facts and events with relative pres- ervation of personal semantic memories following a unilateral temporal lobe stroke. CASE REPORT A 60 year old right-handed man was evaluated 13 weeks after suffering a left hemispheric stroke. He was born in 1938 in Penn- sylvania and evaluated in 1998. His native language was English and he had lived his entire life in the United States. He had been employed as a mechanical engineer with expertise in accident analysis and legal testimony. However, following the stroke, he was unable to return to work. His presenting complaint was I have difficulty remembering things . He had a 5 year history of non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension but no significant past neurological history. A neu- rological examination revealed normal motor, sensory, and cere- bellar systems and a normal gait. Cranial nerve examination disclosed a right superior field hemianopsia with normal pupillary responses and normal visual acuity with correction. Neuropsychological evaluation was performed. The patient was alert and oriented to the situation. He was cooperative and attentive during the course of the examination. He exhibited a normal level of psychomotor activity. His speech and language were of normal loudness and prosody with no word finding dif- ficulties or paraphasic errors. His affect showed normal range and intensity and he acknowledged concern and insight into his im- paired memory and inability to return to work. A Wechsler In- dividual Achievement Test (WAIT) Screener Set showed that the patient was severely impaired in sight reading which fell at the level of 3rd grade and also impaired in spelling (at the level of 6 7th grade) . He had agraphia but no difficulties in color naming or finger agnosia. His performance on tests of mathematical rea- soning showed he had retained the basic concepts and operations but made careless errors partly due to inaccurate comprehension of word problems. His scores on the mathematics test were equivalent to the 12th grade, which is below expectation relative to his educational and occupational backgrounds. A Rey s Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RVLT) showed that relative to his age range, he was severely impaired including learning over five trials in tests of both short and long term memory. He was asked to read a list of 15 unrelated common words and immediately afterward asked to recall them. After hearing and recalling the list of 15 words 5 times, another list of 15 new words was read to be recalled and to serve as a distraction. Recalling the words from the original list was requested imme- diately afterwards and again after 30 min of unrelated activities. Furthermore, after the delayed recall, the patient was shown a short story that contains the 15 words and was asked to identify them as a measure of recognition. After the brief distraction, he could not remember any of 15 words. In the recognition test, he correctly identified only 1 out of the 15 words and misidentified 2 words that were not on the list. poor over the preceding four decades. For example, he was able to name the current American president, Bill Clinton but could not rovide any details of events during his presidency including olitical scandals. He could not recall details of major American ublic events such as the John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King assassinations from the 1960s and Nixon s impeachment or the end of the Vietnam War from the 1970s. In general, his recall for ublic events and names prior to 1960 was slightly better. He was able to remember the name of President Truman although he could not recall any other details of his tenure. He also remem- ered that a retired general became president (Dwight Eisen- ower) but could not recall his name. Similarly, his recall of some events associated with American involvement in wars was better for World War II when compared to either the Korean or Vietnam Wars. He was able to recall the month and year of the attack on Pearl Harbor but not D-day or what year the war ended. Overall, is knowledge was still poor. He was able to recall only the opposition country of Germany, and was unable to recall any leaders of the opposing countries. His knowledge of Korean and Vietnam Wars was worse since he could not recall that they had even occurred. His recognition of public faces was similarly poor when tested by direct confrontation with pictures of Presidents and American personalities. In contrast to his profound deficits in the knowledge of public facts and events, aspects of his autobiographical memory were well preserved. These were assessed by the autobiographical memory interview. On personal semantic questions, he scored 18, 19 and 19 on the childhood, early adult life and recent life periods (maximum score per life period is 21; his results were within normal limits) . His ability to recall autobiographically relevant facts extended from preservation of personally relevant facts from all of the time periods tested from age 6 to 60 years. He was able to recall geography of the area in Pennsylvannia where he grew up and the names and locations of all the schools he attended up to the college where he obtained a Bachelor s degree. He was also able to recall without difficulty all of the various places where he had been employed since graduation including the names of the employers and the kind of work he performed. He never married but was able to recall the names and locations of his close relatives. He was familiar with his personal finances and his medical history. In contrast, he scored 4, 5 and 4 on these life periods on the autobiographical incident tests (maximum score per section is 9; his test results were ab- normal) . All facts were confirmed from a secondary independent source. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS A cerebral MRI examination demonstrated lesion consistent with a stroke involving the left medial temporal lobe extending to the occipital lobe (Fig. 1) . There is damage to the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and the subcortical white matter extending posteriorly into the occipital lobe. A cerebral MRA examination showed an occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery corre- Severe amnesia following a unilateral temporal lobe stroke 103 sponding to the distribution of the stroke. A cerebral SPECT scan showed focal decrease in perfusion over the left temporal and occipital lobes. DISCUSSION This patient exhibits several neurobehavioral deficits following the stroke. These include alexia with agraphia, a deficit most likely secondary to damage to the subcortical fibers of the left angular gyrus. However, the presenting symptom was that of memory difficulties which is a consequence of damage to the left temporal lobe. It has been suggested that the extent of temporal lobe damage correlates with the degree and type of memory loss. In general, those individuals with bilateral hippocampal formation lesions have moderately severe retrograde amnesia for facts and events with a temporal gradient. Those patients with extensive bilateral temporal lobe damage have severe retrograde amnesia for facts and events. This patient s memory deficits for facts and events are severe with memory loss extending for at least 4 decades prior to the stroke and in general, there was better recall for events prior to 1960 suggesting the presence of a temporal gradient. Therefore, his memory deficits appear to be more typical of patients with bilateral than unilateral hippocampal lesions. Whether or not severe amnesia can occur following unilateral temporal lesions has been a subject of debate. In a recent review of the temporal lobectomy literature, analysis of all those cases initially reported to have become truly amnesic following unilat- Fig. 1 (A) and (B) Coronal and sagittal cranial MRI images demonstrating an infarct extending from the left temporal lobe including the hippocampal complex to the occipital lobe in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The best available evidence in this patient is that the lesion is unilateral as documented by cerebral MRI, MRA and SPECT scanning. It has been proposed that there are several types of retrograde amnesia and that this entity can no longer be viewed as a global deficit! Autobiographical memory may be differentiated into episodic and semantic memory with the former referring to an individual s record of events or episodes specifiable in time and space and the latter to an individual s factual knowledge about a person s own past. A recent study of 25 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy and excisions were studied. * Unlike my patient whose memory deficits were profound, they showed only mild memory deficits on standardised tests such as the Wechsler Memory Scale. However, they did demonstrate relative preser- vation of personal semantic memory with deficits in autobio- graphical episodic memory regardless of whether the affected temporal lobe was on the right or left. These findings support the multiple trace theory (MTT) of memory and hippocampal function where it is proposed that the hippocampal complex is an integral part of an autobiographical memory trace as long as it exists and is also involved in the retrieval process. It was sug- gested that there is selective loss of personal episodic memory because fewer complete traces have been laid down in comparison to personal semantic memories. Any attempts at a neuroanatomical explanation of this patient s memory deficits must take into account the status of the contra- lateral hippocampus. If the contralateral hippocampal formation were normal, as it appears to be by MRI and SPECT scan images, this patient s deficits would support the hypothesis of the MTT about the role of an intact hippocampus in retrieving autobio- graphical memories. This patient s pattern of autobiographical memory deficits are similar to those reported by Viskontas et al. in that there is loss of personal episodic memory with relative pres- ervation of personal semantic memory. However, the MTT does not account for the severe loss of memory for public facts and events unless one postulates that in this patient, there is cerebral asymmetry for the retrieval or storage of this kind of knowledge. An alternative explanation is that the contralateral hippocam- pus is abnormal. In one well-studied patient, severe memory loss with relative preservation of autobiographical knowledge was documented following a right temporal lobectomy. The available technology at that time including an EEG, cerebral angiography and pneumoencephalography failed to disclose evidence of a le- sion in the left hemisphere. However, at autopsy, a sclerotic lesion of the left hippocampus was found indicating bilateral damage. In my patient, since the MRI of the contralateral hippocampus ap- pears normal, such an abnormality, if present, would be micro- scopic. If then, there were bilateral hippocampal damage, it would imply that knowledge and retrieval of semantic autobiographical memory is not dependent upon an intact hippocampal formation and therefore contradicts the MTT of memory. The study of this patient demonstrates the fractionation of different s of memoranda within a retrograde time period. ! However, it also exemplifies the complexities of human memory and the difficulties in trying to reconcile neuropsychological findings with the proposed theories of memory. Studies such as this, even of individual patients are of value and will continue to provide insight into mechanisms of human memory.

NOTE AMNESTIC DISTURBANCE FOLLOWING INFARCTION OF THE LEFT DORSOMEDIAL NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS Lyx J. Speepie* and KennetH M. Heitmant Department of Neurology, University of Florida College of Medicine, and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Gainesville, Florida, U. S. A. (Received 30 March 1982) Abstract A patient with a discrete lesion in the region of the left dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus had anterograde memory impairment for verbal material. Korsaxorr [1] described patients who had anterograde and retrograde amnesia for recent events but had intact immediate and remote memory. GubvEN [2] proposed that lesions of the mamillary bodies were critical for disruption of memory in these patients. Detay et al. (3, 4] reported the neuropathologic findings of eight alcoholic Korsakoff patients with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Seven of the patients had considerable atrophy of the mamillary bodies; one patient has thalamic involvement. Mair et al. [5] described two Korsakoff patients whose major damage was in the mamillary bodies. Victor et al. [6] examined 43 brains of patients who had had Wernicke s syndrome. All had lesions of the mamillary bodies, but five had neither a permanent memory deficit nor dorsomedial nucleus lesions. The 38 with permanent memory deficits did have dorsomedial lesions. Although the authors concluded the lesions of the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus were critical for permanent memory decrement, as BUTTERS and CERMAK [7] noted, the 38 patients with a permanent memory deficit also had mamillary body lesions. Thus, although lesions of the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus may be a necessary condition, destruction of both this nucleus and the mamillary bodies (or other areas) may be required for a permanent amnestic condition to emerge. Further evidence for the critical role of the dorsomedial nucleus in memory processes is provided by the well- known case of patient N. A. , who received a stab wound to the base of the brain and had marked anterograde amnesia, particularly for verbal material [8, 9]. Computer tomography 17 yr later revealed marked reduction in the mass of the left thalamus, which appears restricted to the anterior two-thirds of its dorsal portion [10]. However, for the fencing foil to reach the thalamus, it had to traverse other cortical and subcortical structures. Others [11-13] have described amnesia associated with thalamic tumors. Amnesia after thalamic hemorrhage has also been reported (14, 15]. However, tumors and hemorrhages are associated with a mass etfect and thereby induce changes of brain function in areas not directly affected by the lesion. To date, there have been no reports of amnestic disorders induced by thalamic lesions that were not associated with hypothalamic, orbitofrontal or mass effects. CASE REPORT A 33-yr-old right-handed man with 9 yr of education, employed as a heavy-equipment operator, when first seen at the hospital was described as confused and poorly oriented. His wife stated that 3 days earlier he had suddenly seemed unable to remember anything. Admission examination showed his speech to be slow with long pauses. He was oriented to person and time but not to place. He repeated five digits forward and three in reverse, recalled none of three objects after 5 min, and knew his birthdate and address but recalled no previous hospitalizations or medications. Because of a past psychiatric history he was administered haloperidol, 5 mg three times a day. However, because he did not have psychotic ideation and had marked memory impairment, neurological consultation was requested 10 days after admission. *Present address: Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, Maryland, U.

An echocardiogram suggested possible mitral valve thickening with mild stenosis. ~ Neuropsychological evaluation Intelligence and languaye tests. Results of intelligence and language tests [16-18] (see Table 1) indicated average- to-low-average intellectual ability and intact language functions. Table 1.

Frontal lobe function. The paticnt could establish four categories in 122 trials of the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. His performance was inferior to that of normal controls reported by Grant and BerG [19]. Performance on serial hand positions [20] was poor and showed verbal-motor dissociation. A task requiring reordering five to seven words into meaningful sentences was administered. In this task each item contains words of high sequential probability (e. g. police and car) that must be separated to make a meaningful sentence. Preliminary data suggest that patients with frontal lobe disorder cannot resist the stimulus pull of the items (E. Kaplan, 1981, personal communication) . He responded correctly to one of six items and could not separate the words of high sequential probability (e. g. on the item that should form alert police found the car , the patient arranged the phrase the alert found police car ) . Memory tests. Administration of the Wechsler Memory Scale yielded a Memory Quotient of 64 (a difference of 24 points with the Full Scale 1Q and 28 points with the Verbal IQ) . Psychotropic medication had been discontinued on the day memory evaluation began, but residual influence of the drug may have continued. To assess short term memory and vulnerability to distraction, we administered consonant trigrams [21, 22] ~ - three consonants to be retained for 0, 3, 9 or 18 sec intervals. The consonants were presented in the following manner: (1) auditorily at a rate of 1/sec; (2) visually and sequentially (a 4 in. [1. 27 cm] letter printed on three index cards) at a rate of 1/sec; (3) visually and simultaneously (three } in. letters on an index card) presented for 3 sec. there were distraction-free and filled intervals counting backwards. Figure 2 reflects the patient s performance. Without distraction, he reported the letters reliably, which suggested that maintenance strategies were effective. With distraction, from 0 to 18 sec he lost 73% of the letters presented auditorily, 80% of the letters presented visually and sequentially, and 33% of the letters presented in the visual simultaneous format. Maintenance of information over very brief periods without distraction was adequate. With distraction, the degree of information loss received sequentially was similar to that reported for Korsakoff patients (22, 23], for the patient N. A. [9] and for patients with frontal and parietal damage, particularly those with left- hemisphere damage [24]. On the Logical Memory portion of the Wechsler Memory Scale Form I, he recalled three details from the Anna Thompson story and two from the American liner story (about 2 S. D. below that expected for his intelligence and age [25]) . He was also given form II [26] on two consecutive days. On the second day, he did not recognize the material but immediately after the story was read recalled four and five details from the two stories. After a 40-min delay, he recalled two details and one detail, respectively. Traditional administration of the 10 paired associate items from the Wechsler Memory Scale (Form I) yielded recall of 3, 3 and 2 items {all of high association value) on the three consecutive trials. These scores are approximately 3 S. D. below mean scores reported by HuticKa [27] and Wecuser [25]. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning task [28, 29], a list of 15 words that can be meaningfully grouped but are not presented in groups, was read five times. After each presentation the patient was asked to recall all the words he could. He recalled 4, 6, 6, 5 and 5 words on each of the five trials, respectively. After the fifth trial a new list of 15 599 Note Fic. 1. Computer tomogram illustrating the patient's left dorsomedial thalamic lesion.

Patient's performance on consonant trigram procedures. different words was presented. He recalled four of the interference list words. For the seventh trial, he was asked to recall as many words as possible from the first list without further presentation. He could not recall any of the words. Immediately after the final recall trial, he was presented with a written paragraph containing the words and correctly circled eight words and erroneously circled two. The patient's performance on the first trial is approximately | S. D. less than expected from manual laborers, and all other trials were comparatively even less adept [29]. The order of recall suggests a serial ordering strategy with recency predominating. Across the five trials, he recalled more words (69%) from the last third of the list than from either the first (15 ) or second (16%) thirds. To examine learning and retention of visual information, we administered the Rey Osterrieth Complex figure [29, 30], asking the patient to copy the complex diagram and take care to include all the segments. Immediately, and again 20 min later, he was asked to reproduce the drawing without the model present (Fig. 3) . Of a possible 36 points, his score for properly located line segments was 33 for the copied drawing, 13 for immediate recall and 10 for delayed recall. Copy performance was at the 50th percentile and immediate recall below the 25th percentile [29]. Although he maintained basic configuration, he lost substantial internal detail. Quantitatively and qualitatively his performance resembled that reported for N. A. by Teuser et al. [8]. To further test his ability to retain visual designs, we used Kimura's Recurring Figures technique [31]. His score was 39 (44 total correct minus five false positives; a T score of 56) [32], which is similar to mean scores reported by MILNeR and associates [8, 33] as typical of scores of normal controls.

During hospitalization, the patient became more competent in general behavior and less obviously forgetful. However, his emotional condition worsened after an unsuccessful weekend pass, and haloperiodol was once again administered (approximately 2 weeks after we tested him initially) . We were able to Teassess consonant trigrams, paired associates, story recall and the Rey Osterrieth figure before haloperidol therapy was resumed and again 72 hr after resumption of haloperidol. Table 2 shows that his performances before and during haloperidol therapy were similar. Table 2.

Schizophrenia may be associated with deficient performance on learning and memory tasks [35-38], but schizophrenics perform better than do amnestic Korsakoff patients [36]. In spite of the qualitative similarities of our patient's deficits in acquisition and recall of new information to that reported in schizophrenic patients, the sudden onset of memory complaints, together with observations of some improvement in memory function during the course of hospitalization despite worsening of emotional status, argues against his initial deficits being solely a reflection of cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. It is also important that at no time during this hospital stay did he show evidence of psychotic ideation. Although the relationship of haloperidol to performance on learning and memory tasks has received little attention, haloperidol in general is not associated with decreased neuropsychological function [39-42] and the resumption of haloperidol administration in our patient did not seem to adversely affect his performance on our measures. Thus, it seems unlikely that his initial memory deficits should be attributed solely to drug effects. Although we do not have postmortem anatomical verification, CT showed a small lesion in the region of the left dorsomedial nucleus. There could have been other small lesions, but none were seen on CT. We propose therefore that the patient's memory and learning difficulties arose from his thalamic lesion. Qualitatively and quantitatively this patient and N. A. performed similarly, and their amnestic deficit seemed less global and devastating than that of patient H. M. , who had a bilateral temporal lobectomy [8, 43], and those of alcoholic Korsakoff patients. Both of the latter had disruption of both limbic circuits. WATSON [44] suggested that lesions that include both the basolateral (Yakolev) and medial (Papez) circuits may induce a more severe and permanent amnesia than that caused by lesions in either of these limbic circuits alone. MISHKIN [45] demonstrated that lesions in two limbic circuits do induce more severe amnesia than do lesions in one limbic circuit in monkeys. The dorsomedial nucleus has reciprocal projections with the amygdala and is part of the basolateral limbic circuit [46]. In addition, the dorsomedial nucleus receives input from the medial (Papez) circuit, including the hippocampus, probably via the septal region [47, 48]. Thus a discrete dorsomedial lesion is suited to disrupt both circuits. The medial temporal lobe and dorsomedial nucleus are the two anatomic arcas where these circuits arc anatomically adjacent and may therefore be vulnerable to disruption by discrete lesions. Further, dorsomedial thalamus with its connections to the frontal cortex may be important for maintaining a higher order of cognitive facility reflected in successful chunking of information according to a category or semantic structure and sequencing the information accordingly. Perhaps the amnestic patient selects less cognitively taxing strategies that involve less reordering of the information because with interruption of the dorsomedial-frontal lobe connections, the executive functions of the frontal lobe are impaired. Decrement in frontal lobe function may have a role in the failure of amnestic patients to effectively and spontaneously adopt higher level acquisition and Note 603 recall strategies. This postulate is in part supported by our observation of decrements in Wisconsin Card Sorting test performance in this patient and the observations of Moscovitch (1981, personal communication) who showed that alcoholic Korsakoff patients performed poorly on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Procedure. nv REFERENCES .

Abstract Background: Cognitive disorders, such as memory disturbances, are often observed following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. We present a very rare case where rupture of a posterior cerebral artery aneurysm caused restricted damage to the hippocampus unilaterally, and caused memory disturbances. Case presentation: A 56-year-old, right-handed man, with a formal education history of 16 years and company employees was admitted to our hospital because of a consciousness disturbance. He was diagnosed as having a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a left posterior cerebral artery dissecting aneurysm, and coil embolization was performed. Subsequently, he had neither motor paresis nor sensory disturbances, but he showed disorientation, and both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Although immediate recall and remote memory were almost intact, his recent memory was moderately impaired. Both verbal and non-verbal memories were impaired. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cerebral hematoma in the left temporal lobe involving the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated low perfusion areas in the left medial temporal lobe. Conclusions: We suggest that the memory impairment was caused by local tissue destruction of Papez s circuit in the dominant hemisphere due to the cerebral hematoma. Keywords: Amnesia, Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Ruptured cerebral aneurysm Background Cognitive disorders, such as memory disturbances, are often observed following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Basal forebrain amnesia due to aneurysm rupture of the anterior communicating artery was reported more than 50 years ago [1, 2]. Anatomically, the basal forebrain is a region consisting of the external and internal septal nu- clei, the basal nucleus of Mynert, and the diagonal band of Broca. It is believed that cholinergic neurons that regulate cerebral blood flow by projecting to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are present in this structure. It has also been reported that damage to the * Correspondence: maeshima@saitama-med. acjp Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Hidaka, Saitama, Japan Present address: Department of Rehabilitation Medicine II, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, 424-1 Oodori-cho, Tsu 514-1298, Japan Full list of author information is available at the end of the article C BioMed Central lower branch of the corpus callosum, which is a pene- trating branch from the anterior communicating artery, may cause amnestic syndrome with spontaneous con- fabulation or impaired attention [3-6]. Moreover, mem- ory disturbances are seen after surgery on cerebral aneurysm of the basilar tip. It is believed that the pri- mary cause of this is damage to the hippocampus, hip- pocampal gyrus, amygdala, fornix, etc. , which form the perfusion region of the posterior cerebral artery. This damage may result in a circulatory disorder, or occlusion of the paramedian thalamic artery and thalamogenicu- late artery bifurcating from the posterior cerebral artery that sends blood to the diencephalon, or occlusion of the polar artery bifurcating from the posterior commu- nicating artery [7-9].

How- ever, there are hardly any reports of only memory dis- turbance. Here, we report a case of amnestic syndrome and formation of a hematoma inside the left temporal lobe due to a dissecting aneurysm rupture of the distal portion of posterior cerebral artery. Case presentation A 56-year-old, right-handed man, with a formal educa- tion history of 16 years and company employees (office work in an insurance company) was admitted to our hospital because of a consciousness disturbance on 3 January, 2011. He did not have any history of medica- tion. On that day, he lost consciousness immediately after going to the toilet and his family requested emer- gency treatment. Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysm rupture of the left posterior cerebral artery was diagnosed, and coil embolization was performed on the same day. After interventional surgery, the case was referred to our department for rehabilitation. Neurological examination (2\"4 day after surgery) The patient was almost completely conscious; however, disorientation with respect to date, place, and age were found. Although neck stiffness was confirmed, no abnor- malities were found in the nervous system, and there were no obvious movement disorders. No abnormalities in the sensory system and no ataxia or coordination dis- turbance was observed. He was cooperative during the examinations. Although aphasia and apraxia were not found, disorientation of time and place originating from anterograde amnesia was confirmed. He was aware of being hospitalized due to illness, and there was no con- fabulation. Anterograde amnesia was severe, and he had no memory of what he did in relation to the new year and what he ate on the previous day of illness. When responding about the instance where he collapsed in the toilet during the new year , he repeatedly asked Oh, I do not know at all. Is that true? Oh, well, where and when did I collapse? and he was not able to remember even the most recent conversation. In addition, his memory for the approximate 1-month period prior to illness was also vague. On the other hand, he could correctly answer all questions related to his educational and car- eer background, names of his children, etc. Table 1 shows the results of neuropsychological tests. He stopped attempting to answer some questions, as he could not remember them. Although performance was somewhat reduced in the intelligence test, overall cognitive function was intact, and immediate memory was also maintained. Decline in performance was found in all memory related tests, and the effect of verbal and speech learning was also poor. Although mild frontal lobe function disorder was found, depression and anxiety were absent. Page 2 of 5 Neuroradiological examination In addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a hematoma was observed in the left hippocampus, extending to the parahippocampal gyrus in a brain CT scan (Figure 1a) . In cerebral angiography, an irregular dissecting aneurysm was found in the distal portion of the left posterior cere- bral artery. Dissection had occurred in the main trunk of the posterior cerebral artery, and it was formed due to a portion that extended saccular and a portion that ex- tended in fusiform, where the portion that extended in saccular was embolized, and the main trunk was preserved (Figure 1b) . A hematoma was found in the left hippocam- pus extending to the parahippocampal gyrus on then MRI scan on day 10 after the onset of the symptoms (Figure Ic) . In SPECT images on day 14 after the onset of symptoms, around the same area, a decline in cerebral blood flow in the left medial temporal lobe was found (Figure 1d) . Clinical course The clinical course after the endovascular surgery was good, and symptomatic cerebral vasospasm or hydro- cephalus was not observed. Although the patient began to perform daily living activities independently, due to the memory disorder, he had difficulties in schedule management and medication compliance. As overall cog- nitive function was good, we instructed him to keep a note on the desk as an external support strategy, and to note down details of conversation and his daily schedule, to-do ist, etc. Although improvements were seen during the course of his treatment, memory disturbance remained. However, as it became possible to independently manage is life by learning the use of note-taking, he was discharged after 10 weeks. Discussion Amnestic syndromes are conditions in which memory unctions are disproportionately impaired compared to other cognitive functions in otherwise alert patients 8, 9]. In the 1950s, research conducted on memory im- airment due to hippocampal lesions was mainly after resection in patients with serious mental disorders or temporary lobe epilepsy. Scoville et al. [10] studied mem- ory impairment after resection of the mesial temporal obe, and reported that memory impairment is found only when there is invasion on both sides of the hippocampus. Moreover, Penfield [11] suggested that occurrence of memory disturbances on one side is due to a cryptic lesion on the opposite side, and he emphasized that lesions on either side can cause memory impairment. Thereafter, it was reported that relatively mild memory disturbances may be observed due to unilateral lesion, and that mainly verbal memory is impaired due to a left-sided lesion, while non-verbal memory is impaired due to a right-sided lesion; however, temporary memory loss is seen in Maeshima et al.

In recent years, cases of not only verbal memory impairment, but also visual memory impairment and prolonged amnesia due to unilateral lesion have also been reported. In the present case of unilateral lesion of the left side, verbal memory, as well as non-verbal memory, was impaired {14]. This supports the hypothesis that there may be individual variation in verbal and non-verbal lateralization related to memory. With regard to neural circuits related to memory, the Papez circuit that consists of the hippocampus, a group of anterior thalamic nuclei, the medial nucleus of the mammillary body, and the hippocampal gyrus, and the Yakovlev circuit that consists of the amygdala, medial nucleus of thalamus, and interior surface of the frontal cortex have been implicated. Although these circuits are independent, they have a strong mutual relationship {15]. The damage limited to bilateral hippocampus causes anterograde amnesia, but it does not necessarily cause retrograde amnesia [16]. Severe retrograde am- nesia was caused by damage to both of parahippocampal gyri with hippocampus. A widely distributed network of regions underlies the retrieval of past memories, and that the extent of lateral temporal damage appears to be critical to the emergence of severe remote memory im- pairment was discussed [17]. Since retrograde amnesia Maeshima et al. BMC Neurology 2014, 14: 44 http: //www. biomedcentral. com/1471-2377/14/44 Page 4 of 5 Figure 1 Neuroradiological examination.

(B) Cerebral angiography before (left) and after (right) coil embolization. An irregular dissecting aneurysm was found in the distal portion of the left posterior cerebral artery. Dissection had occurred in the main trunk of the posterior cerebral artery, and it was formed due to a portion that extended saccular and a portion that extended in fusiform, where the portion that extended in saccular was embolized, and the main trunk was preserved.

(D) A decline in cerebral blood flow in the left medial temporal lobe was found in SPECT images on day 14 after the onset. was mild and remote memory was maintained, we sup- osed that the pathological lesion of our case was limited to the unilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri. In stroke patients, cerebral infarction is the most fre- quent cause of memory impairment [7, 9, 14], and in many cases it occurs as the result of a thalamic or hip- pocampal lesion. Moreover, with regard to the site of cerebral hemorrhage, pathology of the caudate nucleus, the anterior region of the thalamus, or the anterior part of the splenium of the corpus callosum, have also been reported. On the other hand, memory impairment due to subarachnoid hemorrhage may be caused by several factors such as diffuse brain damage due to the sub- arachnoid hemorrhage itself, intracerebral hematoma, an invasive surgical procedure, or the effect of cerebral vasospasm and hydrocephalus. As_ postoperative complications following cerebral aneurysm of the posterior circulation system, damage to the hippocampus, hippocampal gyrus, amygdala, fornix, etc. , which forms the perfusion region of the posterior cerebral artery, causes circulatory disorder due to occlu- sion of the initial portion. Additionally, the paramedian thalamic artery from the posterior cerebral artery P1 sec- tion, the thalamogeniculate artery from the P2 section, or the polar artery from the posterior communicating artery sends blood to the diencephalon after branching, and particularly when approached infratemporally, there is risk that penetrating branches or the posterior cere- bral artery will be obstructed [18, 19]. In the present case, coil embolization was performed. However occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery or cerebral embolism of its penetrating branches was not found in the postoperative Maeshima et al. BMC Neurology 2014, 14: 44 http: //www. biomedcentral. com/1471-2377/14/44 MRI. Moreover, during the treatment course, symptom- atic cerebral vasospasm or hydrocephalus was not ob- served, and overall cognitive function such as immediate recall and intelligence remained consistent. In addition, in SPECT images, diffuse brain damage was not ob- served, and functional lesions were restricted to the left medial temporal lobe where the hematoma was present. Rather than storage of memory or memory retrieval, the hippocampus is an important site for encoding the memory, and it is involved in fixation of the memory in a specific time in the past [20]. Therefore, when the hippocampus is damaged, retrograde amnesia is not so severe (in most of the cases it is restricted to a few years before the onset of symptoms) , and remote memory re- mains intact. Accordingly, in the present case, retrograde amnesia was restricted to a few weeks before the onset of symptoms, and remote memory was intact. Moreover, spontaneous confabulation or attention disorders, often seen in basal forebrain amnesia [6], were absent. Conclusion This was a very rare case where rupture of a posterior cerebral artery aneurysm caused restricted damage to the hippocampus unilaterally, and caused memory dis- turbances. We believe that this is an important case for confirming the role of the hippocampus in memory.

Warrington (National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, WCIN 3BG) ABSTRACT A case is described of a young male who suffered head injuries in a motor accident and subsequently displayed a severe anterograde amnesia in the presence of a relatively intact retrograde memory. He also demonstrated marked impairment of general intellectual ability, naming, perceptual skills and executive functioning. This case demonstrates a striking dissociation between anterograde and retrograde memory. Moreover the retention of retrograde memory in the face of such severe and global cognitive impairment accentuates the dissociation or isolability of retrograde memory. It is further argued that while frontal impairment occurred in this case it lacks any of the hallmarks of frontal amnesia. The case is further evidence for the fractionation of amnesic syndromes. INTRODUCTION The fractionation of memory into anterograde and retrograde memory in cases of brain injury is a classic example of the contribution of clinical neuropsychology to the understanding of memory function in general, and amnesia in particular. Typically, anterograde amnesia refers to the inability to remember events that occur subsequent to the brain injury or illness. By contrast, retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events which occurred prior to the brain insult. Such a commonly observed dichotomy lends support to the key notions of encoding, storage and retrieval which are fundamental to contemporary cognitive psychology. The failure of anterograde memory in the presence of well preserved retrograde memory suggests that the ability to encode new memories is impaired even though memories encoded before the trauma remain stored and retrievable. The less common instances of preserved anterograde memory in the presence of retrograde amnesia (see Kapur, 1993, for a review) , demonstrate the ability to form and subsequently retrieve new memories when memories formed prior to the trauma are either no longer stored or retrievable. Several recent cases have documented the fractionation of retrograde memory itself. Warrington and McCarthy (1988) d scribed a post-encephalitic patient with a selective but severe retrograde amnesia who nonetheless had a good memory for new words. For example, this patient could define the word AIDS yet had forgotten that his mother was dead. In addition his memory for famous names was greatly improved by a simple cuing procedure, and while unable to name famous faces he performed normally at choosing the familiar one from two unknown but similar distractors. They caution that disparate findings on retrograde amnesia may largely reflect simplistic attempts to capture premorbid memory in a single score. Subsequently, Stracciari, Ghidoni, Guarino et al. (1994) have described two cases of post-traumatic focal retrograde amnesia selectively affecting autobiographical memory. Moreover, De Renzi, Liotti and Nichelli (1987) described a woman who, following encephalitis, retained a normal memory for autobiographical events but demonstrated a severe ' Present address: Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand) . Cortex, (1996) 32, 177-185 178 Richard J. Siegert and Elizabeth K. Warrington semantic amnesia. The patient, L. P. , had an impoverished knowledge of the meaning and attributes of words and their referents, and also a complete loss of knowledge of famous people, events and notions generally known by most people in that culture. In addition, Hodges and McCarthy (1993) have reported a detailed case study of a patient, P. S. , with a chronic amnesic state whose personal autobiographical memory was profoundly impaired but who retained relatively good memory for famous people and events. Moreover, with the exception of knowledge of information about himself P. S. s knowledge of people was less affected than his knowledge of events. He also showed much better knowledge of public figures than people of personal relevance. By contrast, Kapur, Young, Bateman et al. (1989) reported a patient E. D. , who showed marked memory loss for public events over the past 20-30 years, but displayed normal anterograde memory and only patchy impairment for memory of autobiographical events. The present case study involves a detailed clinical description of a brain-damaged young man, T. W. , who provides a striking example of well preserved retrograde memory in the presence of a profound anterograde amnesia, and more general cognitive impairment. While cases of well preserved retrograde memory with severe anterograde amnesia are not unknown, they remain rare. The most famous such case is H. M. He was said to retain relatively good memory for environments familiar to him before his operation (Milner, Corkin and Teuber, 1968) , and perform almost normally at recognising faces that were famous before then (1953) apart from a mild retrograde amnesia for the 1940 s (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975) . However, he displayed the most profound amnesia for events occurring since the operation. A problem with this case however arises from the fact that until quite recently there were very few objective measures of remote and/or autobiographical memory. In fact this issue was not seriously explored until Warrington and Sanders (1971) developed a questionnaire about public events and personalities spanning a 30 year time period. More recently Corkin, Cohen and Sagar (1983, in Parkin, 1984) reassessed H. M. s retrograde deficit. They suggest that in addition to amnesia for a two to three year period immediately preceding his surgery, he also appeared to have a mild memory deficit extending back a further eight years, Thus H. M. s retrograde amnesia seems to have been greater than was originally thought, although firm conclusions are not possible as it was not assessed by quantitative means. In a further case, patient N. A. (Cohen and Aquire, 1981) suffered from anterograde amnesia following a fencing accident. This patient scored better than all the control subjects at identifying famous faces known in the decades before his accident, but did worse than the controls on faces which had been famous only since that date. However, N. A. 's detailed recall of public events was impaired compared with two different control groups for the premorbid period, though not as severely as for the postmorbid period. Thus the dissociation is a relative, not an absolute one. A more recent case which has been documented in detail using objective neuropsychological tests is that of R. B. (Zola-Morgan, Squire and Amaral, 1986) . Patient R. B. sutfered an ischaemic episode resulting in a bilateral lesion involving the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Squire et al. reported marked anterograde amnesia, little if any retrograde amnesia, and otherwise preserved intellectual abilities. Their patient R. B. was compared with 8 male medical inpatients matched for age, education and LQ. on several tests of retrograde memory including memory for public events (recall and recognition) , Famous Faces and Crovitz (1988) autobiographical recall method. In general R. B. scored as well or better than the controls, and only showed a retrograde amnesia for a few years immediately preceding his ischaemic episode in the 1970's. These three cases have the advantage of resulting from relatively circumscribed lesions. In H. M. s case this arose from surgery which removed the mesial parts of the temporal lobes in both hemispheres in order to treat intractable epilepsy. In N. A. s case a miniature fencing foil accidentally entered the right nostril puncturing the base of the brain and causing a lesion to the dorsal medial nucleus. Although a subsequent MRI study found damage to several diencephalic structures including the internal medullary lamina, the intralaminar nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus and the mammillothalamic tract (Squire, Amaral, Zola-Morgan et al. , 1989) . By contrast the present case arose from a closed head injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident in which more diffuse injury occurred. Such accidents are a common cause of brain injury and of amnesia. Kapur (1988) notes that memory symptoms, and Retrograde memory 179 Fig. | CT-scan showing bilateral low density frontal lobe lesions. particularly impairment on tasks emphasising a long-term component, are a frequent result of blunt head injury even among patients considered to have made a good recovery. While any direct relationship between anterograde and retrograde amnesia remains unspecified, it has generally been accepted that the more severe one is, the more severe the other, although numerous studies have now shown that anterograde and retrograde amnesia are dissociable. Kopelman, Wilson and Baddeley (1989) found a significant correlation between anterograde and retrograde measures when comparisons were made between diagnostic groups of amnesics but not within the groups. They suggest that this provides some support for independent (or partially independent) brain structures or neurochemical systems underlying anterograde and retrograde amnesia. The prevailing wisdom is that the most common pattern of memory loss following brain injury is anterograde amnesia with variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. This is not the case in the present instance where a sharp dissociation exists. CasE HISTORY T. W. is a 26-year-old university student who was admitted to the National Hospital Queen Square in December 1994, having been transferred from a hospital in France where he had been taken after the car in which he was travelling crashed on 30. 11. 94. Details were sketchy but it is understood he was initially unconscious for 24 hours post accident. He was pyrexic with a stiff neck during the first hospitalisation and treated accordingly for suspected meningitis. Upon admission to the National Hospital he was diagnosed as having head injuries, C5 and C6 subluxation, queried post-meningitis sequelae, and an impacted fracture of the left neck of the humerus. He was soon alert, communicative and fully mobile although remaining confused and disorientated for some time. A CT scan demonstrated bilateral, frontal lobe, low density lesions consistent with infarcts greater on the left. There was ventricular dilatation greater on the left (see Figure 1) . Neuropsychological Testing Initial Cognitive Testing As part of a general clinical cognitive assessment T. W. was administered a number of tests intended to assess current intellectual functioning, memory, language, perception, and performance on tests considered sensitive to frontal dysfunction. He showed impairment on most of the tests with the notable exception of a test of identification of contemporary famous faces on which he obtained a very satisfactory score of 10/12 correct. On the WAIS-R he obtained a Verbal IQ of 74 (borderline) and a Performance 1Q of 60 (defective) . At initial 180 Richard J. Siegert and Elizabeth K. Warrington testing T. W. obtained a scaled score of 9 on the Digit Span subscale of the WAIS-R: this was repeated and his best score was 7 forwards and 4 backwards. While probably a decline from his premorbid ability, nevertheless it was considered that his attention span was sufficient for the range of other cognitive tasks administered. On the National Adult Reading Test he obtained a reading IQ equivalent of 111 which was considered to be below his optimum level since a degree of dyslexia had been reported in the immediate post-trauma period. On the Graded Naming Test he obtained an average score of 15/30 (McKenna and Warrington, 1983) . Two tests from the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery were administered: on the Object Decision test he scored 16/20 which is within the normal range and on the Incomplete Letters test he scored well below the 5% cut-off score (Warrington and James, 1991) . On tests considered sensitive to frontal dysfunction his performance was generally impaired, although not invariably so. He was unable to complete the Weigl sorting task. He performed poorly on the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test achieving only 2 categories. His word fluency was poor insofar as he could only generate 8 words beginning with the letter s in 90 seconds (<5%, Lezak, 1995) . His explanations of proverbs were poor, typically in rather literal and concrete terms. However, his performance on the Cognitive Estimates test was satisfactory (Error score 4 - Shallice and Evans, 1978) . Overall, these results were consistent with frontal lobe damage. In summary, T. W. showed evidence of generalised cognitive decline, including some frontal signs. A more detailed and in depth assessment of his anterograde and retrograde memory functions was documented. Anterograde Memory Recognition Memory Testing T. W. s recognition memory was assessed on the Recognition Memory Test (1) , on a set of easy recognition memory tests (2) and on a further 3-choice test for distinct pictured scenes (3) . His performance on these six recognition memory tests was uniformly and consistently impaired. His raw scores and percentile scores age given in Table I. Recall Testing T. W. was tested on the Story Recall, List Learning, and Figure Recall parts of the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (4) . He was also tested on the Paired- Associates subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (5) and on an easy Paired-Associates Learning test (2) . His raw scores and percentile scores on the recall measures are given in Table I. Again T. W. s performance on these recall measures was consistently and fairly uniformly impaired. Admittedly, T. W. s poor performance at even copying the Coughlan figure may have considerably limited his subsequent ability to reproduce it correctly from memory alone. Retrograde Memory T. W. s retrograde memory was assessed using a further modification of the Famous Faces test (Warrington and McCarthy, 1988) , the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, Wilson and Baddeley, 1989) , and the Crovitz (Crovitz and Schiffman, 1974) method. These will be described separately. Politician s Faces Test As the initial assessment had revealed a surprising ability to both name and identify by occupation, pictures of well known people, a more demanding test of this ability was designed. Twelve monochrome photographs of British and American politicians who had been in office at some time in the past two decades (the patient was 26 years old) were assembled. These included three American presidents (Bush, Reagan and Carter) , three Labour Party leaders (Kinnock, Foot and Callaghan) , three Liberal leaders (Ashdown, Steele and Thorpe) and Retrograde memory 181 TABLE | Anterograde Memory Tests: Raw Score and Percentile Score on Each Test Recognition Recognition Memory Test !

(1945) Note: Norms for the Clegg and Warrington tests are based upon thirty-three 75-81 year olds. three Chancellors of the Exchequer (Baker, Lamont and Howe) . The patient was given the photographs in triplets and asked to name each individual then to say what the person was famous for (i. e. their job) . After all three in a specific group had been presented he was told their occupation (e. g. these three men have all been President of the U. S. ) , and then asked to order the photographs chronologically (e. g. Carter, Reagan, Bush would be a correct response) . T. W. correctly named 11/12 politicians. The one exception was Jim Callaghan of whom he said Jim something, McGregor . He also correctly identified the political position of 11/12 again making a mistake for Callaghan. What was most striking however was that he correctly ordered all four triplets of politicians according to their chronological sequence and took only a few seconds on each set. Autobiographical Memory The Autobiographical Memory Interview was administered. T. W. s scores are presented in Table II along with cut-off scores from the AMI Manual (Kopelman, Wilson and Baddeley, 1990) . Inspection of Table II shows that for Personal Semantic memories T. W. shows a robust memory for the childhood period, in fact better than the average control. His memory for the Early Adult period however is somewhat below the range for normal functioning. This may be, at least in part, an artefact of the Measure used. T. W. scored a maximum of 8 for the section of Early Life in Career (i. e. Part 4) , He was able to state his university qualifications, name the course and university, give his full residential address at the time, and name three friends from that period. By contrast for Part 5 and 6 (Wedding and Children) the subject matter seemed far less salient for the patient who is a single male. On the second part of the A. M. L, Autobiographical Incidents, T. W. scored as well as the controls for both Childhood and Early Adult. His memory for the Recent Life section of Personal Semantic Memory was rather poorer, as might be expected, since this section asks several questions about events soon after the head injury occurred (e. g. Present hospital, Previous hospital) which are anterograde events. For Recent Events he scored somewhat below the level of the controls. However, this score for Recent Events is somewhat misleading since it combines 182 Richard J. Siegert and Elizabeth K. Warrington TABLE IT T. W. s Scores on the Autobiographical Memory Interview Compared with A. M. I. Manual Cut-off Scores* T. W.

Where acceptable is within | SD of mean for controls and definitely abnormal refers to scores below which no healthy controls scored. events which occurred pre-trauma ( Holiday and Journey ) and post-trauma ( Last Christmas ) into one score. When the subsections of the Recent Events scale are segregated into anterograde and retrograde events an interesting picture emerges. For personal Semantic Memory, scores of 10/18 for anterograde and 3/3 for retrograde events were obtained. For Autobiographical Incidents scores of 2/6 for anterograde and 3/3 for retrograde were obtained. Thus the general picture of impaired anterograde memory, and relatively robust retrograde memory, is again demonstrated. In fact, even the 10/18 for anterograde events on Personal Semantic Memory may be somewhat inflated. Four of these ten points were scored by T. W. for giving his correct home address twice. In fact this was his parents current address, he had grown up there and it was undoubtedly weil learned over many years in the retrograde period. Moreover, a qualitative analysis supports this picture. For example, patient T. W. could not name the hospital he was presently in and scored zero for remembering Last Christmas (which had occurred since the November accident) . Similarly, he gave the year as 1993 (it was January 1995) . After four weeks in Queen Square Hospital as an inpatient he could name only one staff member, yet he easily recalled the names of several classmates and teachers from his prep school days. Moreover, he recalled attending the Miss World contest in October 1994 naming the city and country where it took place, his companion at the event, and the eventual contest winner. The Crovitz Technique Crovitz (1988) method of asking the subject to generate personal memories in response to cue words was used. The twelve words were those used by Baddeley and Wilson (1988) (namely, letter, throw, happy, find, game, successful, river, lonely, dog, make, angry, and break) , Of these twelve trials one produced a response which referred to an innocuous incident that had occurred only minutes prior to the testing session. The remaining responses all referred to fairly specific events from T. W. s life before the accident and were relatively rich in detail. Three typical responses are presented in Table II with identifying elements modified. Follow-up Testing The patient was reassessed approximately six weeks later to establish that his pattern of deficits was a reasonably stable one. As retrograde memory was relatively spared it was not reassessed (the Crovitz technique was repeated as a reliability check) . On the WAIS-R the patient obtained a Verbal 1. Q. of 91 and a Performance L. Q. of 67. This reflects a moderate improvement in verbal skills and little change (allowing for some practice effect) in performance ability. His scores on the Recognition Memory Test (Words, 33/50; Faces, 39/ 50) and the Story Recall subtest of the AMIPB (Immediate, 20/60; Delayed, 19/60) showed Retrograde memory 183 TABLE IU Examples of Cue-Recalled Autobiographical Memories* 1. LETTER: I remember receiving my first letter, not sure who from, aged 7 or 8. . . just the excitement about a letter being written to you, not believing it really. . . just the way it was written, saying Master T. W. , P'd never seen something that formal before. On probing T. W. gave his residential address at that time including street name, street number, town and county. 2. HAPPY: I remember being happy passing C. C. E. , Common Entrance. I was in a big room with everyone else and the headmaster sat us all down and told us out loud who had passed and failed. I was told by the Headmaster that I was lucky to pass in front of everybody. I had failed maths but they took me for my overall results. On probing T. W. named the Headmaster, and said this occurred at about 9 a. m. during Summer. 3. BREAK: I can remember working on a building site, one of the things I'd been told before was don t take too long a break . . . first day on the job, first break, I went to the shack where we had tea, said to another worker, How long s the break? . He said It s half an hour. Other workers were there. We were working on a big old house near N---, turning it in to flats. On probing T. W. said that this occurred just after he left school so it would have been September 1989 . modest improvement but were all at or below the 10th percentile for his age. Naming was at an average level (20/30) . Performance on a test of visuospatial ability had markedly improved (Position Discrimination, 17/20) . There was no evidence of improvement on frontal tasks. On a word fluency task he generated only 10 s words in 90 seconds and with some perseverative responses. On the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test he again achieved only two categories. On the Crovitz test T. W. recalled four events that were virtually identical to four of the eleven recailed at the initial testing. One further event showed a degree of overlap, and he recalled 6 new events (again these were quite specific and detailed memories) . As the Crovitz method is completely open ended it is most unlikely that a patient will recall exactly the same set of memories. These results provide evidence nonetheless for the consistency of T. W. s recall given the six-week inter-test interval. For example, Baddeley and Wilson (1986) reported eight patients described as having high reliability over a one-week period, four of whom spontaneously recalled the same incident on 4 or 5/12 trials. DISCUSSION The present case provides a clear example of the relative preservation of memory for premorbid events despite a severe degree of anterograde amnesia. This was observed in a case of closed head injury which entailed widespread cognitive impairment including severe intellectual decline, naming deficits, visual perceptual difficulties and pronounced frontal impairment. In fact the relatively well preserved retrograde memory in the context of such widespread impairment is remarkable in itself. Shallice (1988, p. 35) has noted in reference to such cases that the selective preservation of a function presents an important but rare dissociation. That is to say the preservation of retrograde memory in spite of the decline in anterograde memory, general intellectual ability, perceptual and executive skills, lends strong support in favour of its functional independence or modularity. In addition it adds to a growing body of clinical evidence that anterograde and retrograde memory can be dissociated (Milner, Corkin and Teuber, 1968; Cohen and Squire, 1981; Kapur, 1993) . Nonetheless given the patient incurred almost global cognitive impairment the question arises as to whether the general cognitive impairment alone can account for the memory deficits observed? Or given the severe frontal damage incurred can this case best be construed as an instance of frontal amnesia ? In response to the former question the suggestion that the observed memory deficits are simply the result of intellectual impairment does not account for the well preserved memory for premorbid events. Such a hypothesis would require that a high level of intellectual functioning is necessary for the retrieval of new memories (perhaps 184 Richard J. Siegert and Elizabeth K. Warrington in strategy formation) but not old memories. This does not seem credible in the present case, For example, our subject was able to remember the names and faces of politicians from the 1970 s and 80 s, and also to place them in chronological order. It seems unlikely that such a task would necessarily place any less demands upon executive processes than responding to a simple paired-associate learning task or recognition memory test. Thus to dismiss T. W. s memory dissociation as merely an artefact of his intellectual impairment would demand the assumption that preserved intellect is necessary for anterograde memory but not for retrograde. Admittedly, it could be argued that since anterograde memory requires both encoding and retrieval, whereas retrograde requires only the latter, that defective intellect disrupts the acquisition process. However this seems a much less parsimonious explanation than simply accepting the observed dissociation between anterograde and retrograde memory. There remains the question of whether or not the patient s memory deficits could not be better interpreted as an instance of frontal amnesia . In other words that they arise not from direct impairment of memory but rather as an indirect effect of failures in executive functioning. We shall consider T. W. s deficits in the context of what is known about the frontal lobes in memory disorders. Typically, memory disorders associated with lesions of the frontal lobes are quite different from those associated with either bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions or lesions to the diencephalic midline (Shimamura, Janowsky and Squire, 1991) . Milner (1982) observed patients with frontal lesions to be impaired at recency discrimination. Lezak (1983) notes that there are frequently problems arising from a reduced capacity to integrate temporally separated events. Similarly, Shimamura et al. asked Korsakov and non- Korsakov amnesics to reproduce the chronological order of 15 events occurring between 1940 and 1985. They reported that patients with frontal lobe lesions showed significant impairment on this sequencing test but were not significantly impaired on recognition tests about the events themselves. Shimamura et al. also reported that patients with frontal lesions were not impaired on most tests of new learning ability that is they may perform poorly on recall tasks where strategy and planning is required but do better on recognition tasks. Another characteristic of some frontal amnesics (especially where the anterior communicating artery is implicated) noted by Shallice (1988) , is the tendency to confabulate. In summary, a prototypical frontal amnesic might arguably show poor recall memory but much better recognition, perform poorly on tasks requiring the temporal sequencing of events, and have a tendency to confabulate. Does this description fit our patient T. W. ? In fact T. W. performed equally poorly on both recognition and recall. He performed remarkably well on the politicians faces task which required him to order them chronologically. Moreover, he showed little or no evidence of confabulation. In conclusion, there was no evidence that T. W. s amnesia fitted a frontal characterisation. Jn summary we have presented the case of a young man who, after a closed head injury, demonstrates a severe anterograde amnesia with a relatively well preserved retrograde memory in spite of general intellectual impairment and clear frontal features. This represents a clear dissociation of anterograde and retrograde memory. Acknowledgements.

Organic and psychogenic retrograde amnesia have long been considered as distinct entities and as such, studied separately. However, patterns of neuropsychological impairments in organic and psychogenic amnesia can bear interesting resemblances despite different aetiologies. In this paper, two cases with profound, selective and permanent retrograde amnesia are presented, one of an apparent organic origin and the other with an apparent psychogenic cause. The first case, DD, lost his memory after focal brain injury from a nail gun to the right temporal lobe. The second case, AC, lost her memory in the context of intense psychological suffering. In both cases, pre-morbid autobiographical memory for people, places and events was lost, and no feeling of familiarity was experienced during relearning. In addition, they both lost some semantic knowledge acquired prior to the onset of the amnesia. This contrasts with the preservation of complex motor skills without any awareness of having learned them. Both DD and AC showed mild deficits on memory tests but neither presented any anterograde amnesia. The paradox of these cases opposite causes yet similar clinical profile exemplifies the hypothesis that organic and psychogenic amnesia may be two expressions of the same faulty mechanism in the neural circuitry. Keywords: Retrograde amnesia, remote memory loss, psychogenic origin, functional retrograde amnesia, autobiographic amnesia 1. Introduction Retrograde amnesia (RA) refers to the inability to re- call information acquired prior to the onset of a cerebral pathology. Up until a few years ago, this amnesic syn- drome was neglected by memory researchers in favour of anterograde amnesia study, which is easier for care- givers to identify, more accessible to measurement for clinicians and more disabling for patients [16]. How- ever, in recent years there have been a growing number of studies on RA, more specifically on a subgroup of memory disturbance, focal retrograde amnesia (FRA) , whose existence is still a matter of debate in light of the existing models of long-term memory.

In 1885, Ribot (cit- ed by Kapur [14]) anecdotally reported a case, which he described as an example of incurable amnesia, ex- tending only onto the past . Since then, patients show- ing this syndrome have been described several times in modern literature. These cases can be roughly divided into two broad groups [17]. On the one hand, there are those who have lost their memory after a neurolog- ical disease. On the other hand, there are patients with FRA who do not show detectable neurological dysfunc- tion but for whom a psychogenic aetiology is presumed to be at the source of the memory disturbance. This organic-psychogenic dichotomy has been clouded by a considerable number of cases whose organic and/or psychological aetiology remains unclear.

Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma of his autobiographical past, showing a RA which is very much disproportionate to what would be expected on the basis of the cerebral pathology alone ([10, 18, 23, 39], and for a review, see [34]) . A wide variety of brain lesions and metabolic defi- ciencies have been associated with FRA (for a review, see [14, 16]) . They range from brain injury, herpes simplex encephalitis and epilepsy to vascular patholo- gy and hypoxia. Diffuse rather than focal lesions are known to produce FRA. When the damage is circum- scribed it is most commonly bilateral [27], and there is always some direct or indirect involvement of the tem- poral lobes [20]. An exception to this observation is the description by Repetto et al. [36], of a patient with focal transient hypometabolism in the right globus pallidus and putamen and persistent significant autobiographi- cal semantic and episodic memory gaps 9 months after the single event. The semiology of organic FRA may or may not be characterized by a temporal gradient, the memory deficit usually encompasses autobiographical data and public events and faces, but can also cover encyclopaedic knowledge. Retrograde amnesia following a stressful or trau- matic event has intrigued authors since the turn of the 19' century. More recently, psychoanalytic psychia- trists coined the term dissociative amnesia to denote the phenomenon. Amnesic symptoms in these patients usually range from gaps in memory lasting from min- utes to days, and the memory loss usually ends within a few hours or days after its initial presentation [25]. In- dividuals with psychogenic amnesia most typically on- ly lose access to their personal data, although semantic knowledge may be affected as well [18]. Despite the fact that organic and psychogenic amne- sia can be quite similar in their presentation, few links have been drawn between them until recently. Previ- ously organic amnesia was a domain of interest for neu- rologists whereas psychogenic amnesia was an area of interest for psychiatrists, with few overlaps between the two fields. An attempt to reach a unified comprehen- sion of the two syndromes has recently come from neu- ropsychology. Its growing diagnostic sophistication and contributions to the conceptual understanding of neurological diseases and its more recent contribution in the field of psychiatry have led many authors to dis- cuss similarities and differences between organic and psychogenic amnesia. Markowitsch [25] and Kopel- man [18] particularly, have argued that these classifi- cations represent two sides of the same coin , or form end-points along a continuum rather than discrete cate- gories, and that organic and psychogenic amnesia may stem from common pathophysiological mechanisms. Lying within this framework of ideas, the present paper is, to our knowledge, the first to directly compare two patients suffering from a strikingly similar dense and focal retrograde amnesia, despite their two apparent different aetiologies. 2. Material and methods: Case reports 2. 1. Case AC: Psychogenic amnesia AC, a 39-year-old right-handed women, was brought to the hospital emergency on April 11 1998, a few moments after having attempted suicide, threatening to jump from a window. She was stopped from doing so by her boyfriend. On arrival of the ambulance, AC was well oriented in time and place. Upon examina- tion in the emergency unit, she was described as being excessively anxious and pacing like a lion in a cage. Her contact with reality was adequate; she expressed feelings of emptiness, loneliness and fear of loosing control. She was given medication for her anxiety and was released from the hospital the same day. Two days later, she appeared to have lost all memory of her pre- vious life. Neurological examination and a head com- puterized tomography performed at that moment were unremarkable. However, AC could not recall anything pertaining to her past. She did not know her own name, address, nor did she remember the suicide attempt of two days previously nor the reasons that had led her to the attempt. She did not know whether she had a family of her own, if her parents were dead or alive nor how long she had been living in this city. On the other hand, memory for on-going events was clinically normal. We could not get many details directly from AC con- cerning the four to six months following the loss of her memory, as this period remains too vague for the patient. According to medical records, the following months were marked by an addiction to Rivotril and al- cohol, as well as intense psychological suffering most- ly due to an abusive relationship with her boyfriend and financial distress. Six months after the onset of the amnesia, AC com- menced weekly psychotherapy sessions with a psychi- atrist. She did not undergo hypnosis nor were there any Amytal injections. Following her psychiatrist s advice, she paid special attention to her dreams, hoping that some elements of her past would emerge from them. She reports having experienced at that time a great deal of frustration and helplessness as a result of not be- J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma 29 ing able to recall anything. According to AC, neither friends nor the boyfriend had reported her memory loss to her family, and it was left to the psychiatrist to do so. He eventually contacted her ex-husband of fifteen years, who appeared on some of her documents as be- ing the person to contact in case of emergency. AC did not know until then that she had been previously married. Subsequently, the ex-husband re-established a rela- tionship with AC and was instrumental in helping her to reconstruct her past. He showed her pictures, told her about their life together and about their three chil- dren (aged between 20 and 25 at the time) . He made frequent trips between the city where he lived and her home to ensure that she met with her children as of- ten as possible. On the first of these reunions, she did not recognize her children, nor did she experience any sense of familiarity towards them. She also did not rec- ognize her mother and sister when she met with them after the onset of her amnesia, and she called her moth- er Ma am for a period of time during the subsequent family meetings. A visit to the city where she raised her children and lived for 15 years did not evoke any memories. Looking at her photographs from childhood to marriage did not evoke any memories either. We interviewed separately the two people who seem to have known her the best: her sister and her ex- husband, in order to better comprehend AC s present condition and to fill in the many gaps in her information about her past. AC left home at 14 because of major disagreement with her father, and possibly because of domestic violence. She had her first child at 15 and two other children before 20. She is described as having al- ways been a hardworking, intelligent women, although she had been struggling with a drinking problem ever since she was a teenager. Both AC and her husband at the time had been drinking quite heavily for many years, and this situation caused them to lose custody of their children for a few years. After the divorce, AC showed many signs of depression and suicidal ten- dencies, symptoms that culminated when she entered a three-year relationship with an abusive man the same man she was living with when she lost her memory. 2. 2. Past and present psychiatric status Information was collected through the patient s med- ical record. Five years prior to the onset of amnesia, AC was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder and depres- sion, two conditions that have persisted throughout the following years and past the onset of the amnesic syn- drome. She is also known to have made a few attempts at suicide during the same period. After she lost mem- ory, AC was diagnosed with a Dissociative amnesia with depressive-anxiety problems on axis | and marital difficulties including violence that triggered the amne- sia on axis V . Hysterical and obsessive-compulsive traits were also noted in the patient. Dual or multi- ple personalities disorder diagnostic were considered and dismissed by the psychiatrist. According to fam- ily members, AC has no known past history of fugue episodes. We had AC fill out a Millon Clinical Multiaxial In- ventory (MCMI-revised) . The profile could not be validly interpreted since a total of 26 questions, corre- sponding to elements pertaining to the past, were left unanswered. 2. 3. Clinical observations We met AC four, then five years (43 then 44 years old) after the onset of her amnesia. She was referred by her neurologist whom she had consulted twice during the previous year for persistent headaches and learning difficulties she was experiencing in a one-year secre- tary course. These are the only known neurological antecedents in AC. AC is a slim, tall woman who looks her age. On each of the six occasions we met her, she was timid, quiet and somewhat serious. Her general attitude in- dicates that she was still upset by her condition. In interviews, she often looked perplexed and sometimes sad when she could not provide answers about her past. AC reported that most of her time and energy was oc- cupied by trying to find her past self for the two years following the onset of the amnesia. Even though she finds it hard to remain with the uncertainty about who she was and what kind of life she had been leading up until her memory loss, she has now decided to get on with her present life and plan her future. She was an eager collaborator throughout the process of collecting information for the present investigation. 2. 4. Neuroradiological examination In addition to the negative CT scan performed after the onset of AC s memory disturbance, a MRI and a resting state SPECT were done, five years post-trauma. The MRI did not show any sign of structural brain damage and the SPECT did not show any focal region of hypometabolism. . 30 J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma 3. Neuropsychological assessment 3. 1. Anterograde memory The patient s anterograde memory was assessed with standard learning tests and semi-structured interviews. On aclinical basis, AC s memory for day-to-day events appears intact, as she is well able to recall events that had occurred in the five years post-trauma . Although she is able to keep track of incoming information, she complains of experiencing some learning difficulties at school. Previously a straight A student, according to transcripts of marks from the early 90s, when she went back to school as an adult student, she now reports having many difficulties keeping pace with her fellow students in a secretarial school for adults. Results of the formal testing on memory measures are shown in Table 1. We tested AC s verbal memory in both English and French, in order to determine whether her difficulties in secretarial school were a consequence of the teaching language (French) , which is less familiar to her, or to verbal encoding deficits per se. AC was raised in French and spoke French fluently until the age of 14. She eventually lost some of her abilities in that language having switched to English when she met her husband. She raised her children in English. AC shows a mild encoding deficit for words in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) , adminis- tered in French, but not in the Logical stories or the Ver- bal Paired Associates of the Weschler Memory Scale Ill, administered in English. The learning slope is a bit flat on the RAVLT and some retroactive interference is noted. These difficulties, and those encountered at school, can be attributable to her loss of familiarity with the French language. On the other hand, her visual memory seemed completely normal as measured by the different tests (WMS-III and Rey-O Figure) . 3. 2. Retrograde memory 3. 2. 1. Autobiographical memory Autobiographical memory for AC was investi- gated with the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) [22] and with a semi-structured interview. The AMI contains questions about personal semantic (Name of first school) and autobiographical incidents (Recall an incident from the first job) for three periods of the patient s life: Childhood, Early Adult Life and Recent Life. AC was unable to recollect any single personal incident in the Childhood or Early Adult Life sections of the AMI. On the other hand, she could easily talk about the last five years of her life. No personal se- mantic information was recalled by AC concerning her childhood, whereas she could recount a few details con- cerning her early adult life since some relearning had occurred (qualifications obtained after leaving school, name of first child) . Her total score in the Personal Se- mantic Information section was 30/63, and she scored 9/27 on the Autobiographical Incidents section. Dur- ing interviews, AC always denied having any memory of her entire life history prior to April 1998. The only so-called memory she had that predated her amnesia was the feeling of having been pregnant. All the other facts she knew pertaining to her past (birth year of her children, previous occupations, year of marriage, etc. ) had been relearned in a detached manner through con- versations she had had with family members and her ex-husband. Those memories are totally without any emotions or sense of intimacy. 3. 2. 2. Semantic memory Semantic information that had been learned before 1998 seems to have been only partly preserved, al- though this is hard to rigorously assess four years post- onset since a relearning of many facts may have taken place. AC did lose all explicit knowledge of a nine- month class she took in the mid 90s in health-care aid- work, about three years prior to the onset of her amne- sia. This program included a computer class. At the time of the assessment by our group, AC was taking a one-year class to become a secretary a course that probably duplicated some of the things she had learned pre-trauma. She mentioned that some of the appren- ticeships did give her a feeling of d ja-vu, but this nev- er evolved into an explicit recall. The loss of seman- tic memory extended to the French language. Medical notes dating back to the months following her loss of memory indicate that she could not properly answer questions in French. AC reported later to her psychia- trist that she did understand the language, but she was unaware that she once was able to speak it until her ex-husband told her so. She eventually relearned the language, but not without difficulty. AC also seemed to exhibit a partial loss of didactic information that was still evident four years post-onset. The score on the Information subtest of the WAIS-III was the lowest score of the intelligence scale (scaled score = 5) . Some responses to this subtest were partic- ularly surprising given her level of education (13 years) . For example, she had no idea when asked On what continent is the Sahara desert? . She did not know what a continent was and examples provided did not J.

She answered France to the question What is the capital of Italy? , and ha no idea of who Cleopatra was. It is possible, however, that part of this loss might be explained by a limited academic achievement. It must also be recalled that CC left her parents home at 14 and had her first chil when she was 15. Performance on Vocabulary was in the superior mean range (scaled score: 12) . AC s explicit recall of famous names was also teste with a test that covers six decades [42]. The overall performance was below that of control subjects an there was no evidence of a temporal gradient, although the patient was more successful with items covering the last decade (78% correct responses for the 1990 s, compared to 62-64% correct responses for the 1960 s, 70 s and 80 s) . 3. 2. 3. Procedural memory AC shows preservation of at least one complex mo- tor skill that was learned before the onset of amnesia: typewriting. When in her first computer class two years post-trauma, she was surprised to realize that she knew where to place her fingers on the keyboard and was quite fast at typing. She did not however, have any recollection of how she learned this skill. 3. 3. Other cognitive functions An exhaustive neuropsychological assessment was also conducted with AC. Language abilities were nor- mal, except for a slight deficit in confrontation naming for low frequency words. Perceptual functions were in the normal range. Attentional capacities (simple im- mediate span of attention, sustained and focused atten- tion) all appeared normal as well. Upon examination of executive functions, AC showed normal planning abilities on the Tower of London, WISC Mazes, Zoo Map and Modified Six Elements Test (BADS) . Howev- er, moderate difficulties were encountered on the copy of the Rey-Osterrieth Figure. The poor reproduction of the figure (result was 27/36) appears to be the prod- uct of haste and carelessness rather than a consequence of visual-spatial or executive disorder. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IIL Short form [35]) indicates that AC was functioning within the average range of intelligence, according to estimates of VIQ = 85, PIQ = 94 and FSIQ = 88 [35]. 3. 4. Case DD: Organic amnesia DD was a 40-year-old, right-handed man who, be- fore his accident, was without any previous medical, 32 J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma surgical or psychiatric history. On November 29 1977, while doing renovations at his workplace, a nail from a hydraulic gun entered his right temporal region. The patient was found somnolent on the accident site but was conscious upon arrival at the hospital and respond- ed adequately to verbal commands. The neurological exam revealed a left visual field defect, a left facial paresis, a left hemiparesis with positive Babinski sign, and a left hypoesthesia to all modalities. He was im- mediately transferred to neurosurgery: a right lateral craniotomy was performed and a 3 cm-long nail was removed. Post-operative evolution was considered favourable. The patient spent three weeks at the hospital recuperat- ing from the accident and the surgery, with his wife by his side. Although he was medicated and sedated for much of the time during this period, he recognised that he was in a hospital and he kept asking his wife and the medical staff why he was there. He was discharged 24 days following admission. Only when he returned home did it become obvious that DD had lost his past memories. At the time of the accident, the patient was married and the father of two sons, aged 14 and 16. He was the manager of an electronics firm where he had been employed for 20 years. After a six-month convales- cence period the patient went back to work although he still presented a left sensory-motor deficit that was as- sociated with a painful sensation (thalamic syndrome) . He had to relearn most of the information pertaining to his work (names and occupations of his colleagues, clients and suppliers, how to make a contract, etc. ) . He needed frequent rest periods during the day because of his fatigability. He was only able to succeed with the constant help of his wife and support of his colleagues. In 1985, seven years after his accident, the company was sold and his work re-evaluated by the new own- ers. His performance as a manager was then judged unsatisfactory and he was offered a salesman position, which he refused. This demotion greatly affected the patient psychologically and apparently exacerbated his chronic pain. He has since been considered unfit to work but has remained active in voluntary work. In 1988, eleven years post-trauma, the patient had a comprehensive workup (neurology, neuroradiology, neuropsychology, clinical psychology and psychiatry) prior to the implantation of a thalamo-lemniscal elec- trode for the treatment of his pain syndrome. The neu- rologic exam was essentially unchanged. It revealed a subtle hemiparesis with increased tendon reflexes and positive Babinski sign on the left, a left hemi- hypoesthesia to all modalities, athetoid movements of left hand with coarse postural tremor, a dysmetria of the left hand and foot on cerebellar testing and a left inferior quadranopia. The patient complained of re- current headaches that were partially controlled with medication. According to the CT- scan (August 1985) and to the MRI scan performed in May 1989 before the implantation of the electrode, the lesion was uni- lateral and linear and extended from the mid portion of the right superior temporal gyrus to the thalamus (VPL, pulvinar and possibly CM) . The lesion involved the posterior part of the insula, the extreme capsule, the claustrum and part of the temporal stem. The mammillo-thalamic tract, amygdala, hippocampus, en- torhinal, parahippocampal and cingulate gyri appeared intact as did as the entire left cerebral hemisphere (see Fig. la, b) . 3. 5. Past and present psychiatric status Information was collected through the patient s med- ical records and interviews with his wife in 1988, and from formal psychological and psychiatric assessment. Past psychiatric history was unremarkable. According to his wife, DD had never shown any signs of psy- chiatric illness in the past. He completed 14 years of formal education with specialization as an electronic technician. He married when he was 21. The cou- ple had two sons, one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia seven years after DD s accident. DD has been involved as a volunteer in an association for par- ents of schizophrenic children since his son s diagnosis. Before his accident, DD seemed fulfilled by his work and his family life. He always maintained close rela- tionships with his brothers, sisters and children. Other than his actual condition, DD is and has always been in good health. He drinks only socially. Results of the MMPI are considered invalid since a total of 52 questions pertaining to the patient s past were left unanswered. Results obtained on the Beck Depression Inventory and on the ASTA in 1988 showed mild levels of anxiety and depression. Psychiatric eval- uation revealed a neutral affect with some depressive elements. The patient has no post-traumatic stress dis- order symptoms or conscious emotional distress relat- ed to his condition. According to his wife, the patient had not changed after his accident as far as personali- ty, tastes and preferences (food, clothing, music, etc. ) were concerned. The patient was briefly re-interviewed in December 1993. Following our 1988 investigation, a thalamo- J.

Treat- ment with hypnosis and acupuncture later brought him some relief but he was still taking medication. DD s wife died from cancer in May 1993. Although their re- lationship was particularly close because his wife was, in a way, his autobiographical memory, he completed the mourning process by participating for a few months in a support group for widowers. He is now leading a normal, active life as a volunteer worker and he is living by himself. He still does not remember anything of his autobiography for the period prior to his accident in 1977. 4. Neuropsychological assessment 4. 1. Anterograde memory With the exception of difficulty in recalling the ear- ly postoperative period, the patient presented no an- terograde amnesia and could adequately recall ongo- ing events. Contrary to what was noted for events preceding his accident, his mental imagery of events that occurred after the trauma was normal. However, some deficits were apparent on formal testing of mem- ory functions. The scores obtained on memory tests are presented in Table 1. Results obtained with ver- bal material (RAVLT, WMS-R) were better than those obtained with visual-spatial material (Rey-Osterreith, WMS-R) , although some retrieval deficits were ob- served in the delayed recall of Logical Memory and Verbal Paired Associates. Significant improvement in performance was seen when retention was assessed with recognition. No evidence of malingering was ob- served ; the patient obtained a score of 98. 75% correct in a forced-choice picture recognition test known to be sensitive to malingering [5]. 4. 2. Retrograde memory Although the patient was evaluated more than ten years post-trauma, his well preserved anterograde memory for the entire period following the onset of his illness allowed us to analyze the characteristics of his retrograde memory loss. 4. 2. 1. Autobiographical memory Autobiographical memory was assessed with semi- structured interview with the patient and his wife in 1988. It was reported that when he was released from the hospital and back at home with his wife and chil- dren, it became evident that DD had completely lost his autobiographical memory. He could not remember any single personal events for his entire life (first year of school, wedding, birth of his children, etc. ) . He did not recognize his house although he had built most of 34 J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma the interior himself, nor the office where he had worked for 20 years. He did not recognize personal belong- ings. He could not recognize his relatives, colleagues or long-time friends. He experienced no sense of famil- iarity when he visited the house in which he was raised or when looking at pictures of his parents or of himself at an earlier age. He could not remember any trip he had made in the past even when looking at pictures and did not recognize anything when he re-visited the same places. Although his well-preserved anterograde mem- ory enabled him to relearn a lot of information about his life, he has never experienced any sense of familiar- ity when relearning his autobiography. He knows that when he was 32, his father died from a heart attack at age 69. DD does not recall whether his father died in his house or at the hospital, although he took care of him every day during the weeks preceding his father s death. The episodic memory deficit extended to public events and famous people the patient should have nown from reading and watching the news (confirmed by his wife) . Although DD was able to relearn a number of important events that had occurred during his life- time, he presented unexpected gaps in his knowledge of public events and famous people. Because there is no standardized remote memory test available for the Quebec francophone population, this last feature was assessed clinically by the presentation of pictures of famous people and recalling of their names with cue- ing and/or recognition if necessary, and the discussion of important public events. Although the patient had some knowledge of certain events, he could not give a detailed account since he did not remember them i. e. , he experienced no sense of having witnessed their oc- currence during his lifetime. Similarly, when present- ed with musical themes of famous television programs, the patient could only recognize the more recent ones, all broadcast after his accident. 4. 2. 2. Semantic memory The patient reported that he had lost a great amount of previously acquired information (e. g. geography, history, literature, music) , a fact that was confirmed by his wife. He had to completely relearn the map of his hometown. He could not explicitly remember anything concerning his specialized training as an electronics technician. Despite having relearned a lot of informa- tion at the time of the assessment, formal tests of gen- eral knowledge confirmed the presence of numerous gaps compared to what one would expected given his socio-cultural status and educational level. DD could not name the continents, did not know who discovered Canada, and thought Julius Caesar was a singer. His performance was not facilitated with multiple choice. He obtained a scaled score of 6 on the Vocabulary sub- test. He could not provide the definition of a number of words he should have known given his premorbid level. These were low frequency words that were probably learned at an older age (e. g. , reluctant, remorse, tangi- ble, etc. ) . Although he did not present any obvious lan- guage deficits and his basic reading and writing skills were preserved, some grammatical rules were lost and a number of orthographic errors were made when writ- ing dictation. Again, there errors concerned mostly low frequency words. Arithmetic skills were preserved but part of the multiplication tables had to be relearned. This was easily done and, at the time the evaluation was performed, DD did not present any difficulties solving arithmetic problems (WAIS-R scaled score: 10) 4. 2. 3. Procedural memory The patient seemed to have retained a number of pre- morbidly acquired skills, such as driving his car, skiing, swimming and skating. This normal performance con- trasted with the absence of a conscious recollection of having done those things in the past. His abilities to use tools appeared intact at least for basic operations; more complex skills could not be assessed, as the patient still presented a left sensory-motor deficit precluding the use of many tools. He had however retained cer- tain highly complex skills such as repairing electronic circuits. As the patients spontaneously stated: For manual things, I do it but cannot explain how. . . I do it without knowing why. . . It s in me . 4. 3. Other cognitive functions A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was conducted in DD, as part of the pre-operative workup. Confrontation naming was mildly deficient but mostly for low-frequency words. Reading was slow but no errors were made on the Chapman-Cook test. Verbal fluency was limited. As described be- fore, DD made many errors when writing to dicta- tion and complained of having lost many grammatical tules, a fact that was confirmed by his wife. Spelling was as deficient as was writing to dictation. Repeti- tion was normal. A mild to moderate deficit of visuo- perceptual functions was apparent on Benton s tests tion, where DD obtained scores of 43/54 and 21/30 respectively, and on the Hooper Visual Organisation J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma 35 Test (22. 5/30) . There was a more severe deficit on the copy of the Rey-Osterrieth Figure, where performance was below the first percentile (23/36) . On Object As- sembly and Block Design, the performance was slow but normal overall. Visual exploration was slow but there was no omission on Letter Cancellation. The IQ scores were in the normal range with a slightly lower score on the Performance Scale compared to that of the Verbal Scale, consistent with DD s visual-perceptual deficits and slowing (VIQ = 92; PIQ = 85; FSIQ = 88) . There was no frontal lobe semiology as assessed by WCST, Trail A & B, Luria s graphic series and ges- tual sequences. On the Stroop Test, the performance was slow but there was no interference effect on the third condition (name color print) . Table 2 highlights the similarities between CC and AC in terms of the general characteristics of their am- nesia and memory systems. 5. Discussion The two patients presented share a similar memory profile in many regards. The retrograde amnesia covers 40 years without any temporal gradient modulating the memory loss. Although both patients were able to re- learn many aspects of their personal history, neither of them ever recovered the vividness and authenticity of their past memories. Indeed, not a single autobiograph- ical memory has emerged for AC and DD since the oc- currence of their respective trauma. Semantic memory also appears similarly affected in both patients, who ex- hibit patchy didactic knowledge. Furthermore, both patients showed a preservation of most motor skills ac- quired before the onset of the amnesia, without any memories of the acquisition of those abilities. Finally, anterograde memory functions appear mildly dimin- ished for both patients on tests but not on a day-to-day basis. AC shows some learning difficulties for verbal material whereas DD has encoding deficits with visual stimuli, a fact that is compatible with his right-sided brain lesion. One of the interesting observations to come out of these cases is how an organic and a psychological con- dition can both trigger the same profile of complete FRA. These case presentations tend to support the hy- pothesis of a disruption of retrieval processes rather than a deterioration of the memory substrata per se. The disconnection may be a consequence of mechani- cal alterations in the brain of organic amnesia. In psy- chogenic amnesia the disconnection may be induced during processing of autobiographical information in a way that can be described as a desynchronization of the activity that give access to memory patterns [25]. The similarities of the two cases provide support for the hy- pothesis postulating a dysfunction in a common under- lying pathway in both types of amnesia. Markowitsch etal. [28] and Costello et al. [6] produced PET evidence of defective right frontal retrieval mechanisms in psy- chogenic and organic amnesia, a procedure that could not be used with our patients owing to their possible relearning of autobiographical information. Taken separately, the semiology of our two patients conditions does not match the typical features of or- ganic and psychogenic amnesia. AC s amnesia differs from what is usually observed in psychogenic amnesia in its seven years of persistence despite a strong de- sire to recuperate. This is a far longer duration than what is usually observed in psychogenic amnesia which abruptly resolves within a few hours or days after its initial presentation, following a confrontation with el- ements of past life [1, 3, 25, 38]. As concerns DD, he was left with a retrograde amne- sia which appeared to be unusually severe in compari- son to the extent of his lesion. As Teuber reported [40], he found no case in which RA appeared in isolation in 100 cases of penetrating brain injury, a finding also reported by Salazar et al. [37]. In general, focal retro- grade amnesia is found following diffuse and bilateral lesions. Based on the existing written evidence, Ka- pur [15] concluded that a focal pathology of the tempo- ral lobes is unlikely to provoke a global autobiographic retrograde amnesia. Two years later, Markowitsch et al. [27] suggest that circumscribed bilateral lesions can produce such an amnesia, although the precise location of the lesion remains obscure. DD s case, featuring a focal and unilateral penetrating lesion, appears to chal- lenge these affirmations and offers a potential region of interest. The lack of anterograde amnesia in DD is con- sistent with preservation of the medial temporal lobe structures namely the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, when penetrating head injury disrupts anterograde memory functions, it is mainly due to poor retrieval and poor control of learning rather than storage deficit [32]. An important point to discuss is the genuineness of AC s amnesia [13, 19]. We believe that in the case of AC there is evidence of an authentic, unconsciously triggered hysterical amnesia. First, there is a lack of secondary gains. AC was never involved in litigation nor did she gain any financial advantages in this situa- tion. It might be argued that AC simulated to escape her 36 J.

(structured clinical interview and questionnaires) Retrograde autobiographic memory information. DD did not recognize his family nor the home that he had built himself. AC did not recognize her 3 children in their 20 s nor her mother. Anterograde memory Table 1) Semantic memory Procedural memory though there was a slight difficulty learning new material (see Partial loss of didactic (geography and history) and general cultural knowledge Preserved, although there was no recollection of the original learning experience for skills (e. g. capacity to repair electric circuits for DD and knowledge of typing for AC) painful marital situation. However, a counter-argument is that there was no alleviation of the symptoms despite the fact that her relationship was terminated four years previously. If AC s case was one of malingering in order to get attention from the medical community, one would have expected her to get help after the onset of the amnesia. Instead, she only consulted a psychiatrist six months after her loss of memory. Also, she never mentioned anything about her amnesia to her neurolo- gist on any of her appointments, two years post-onset. Gaining the sympathy of her relatives might also have motivated AC to simulate, but again, if that was the case, one would think that she would have found a way to alert the family about her condition earlier than six months after the onset. Furthermore, it has been re- ported by family members that AC did not seem com- fortable nor content in family meetings following the onset of amnesia. Second, no major inconsistencies were found be- tween various interviews with AC and between her statements and her ex-husband s nor her sister s state- ments. Moreover, these two relatives were both very adamant about AC s amnesia. Third, her state of anx- iety and preoccupation concerning her memory loss does not seem typical of a simulated amnesia. Lastly, the long duration of AC s amnesia (seven years) speaks in favour of a non-simulated condition, although a pro- longed duration (one year) of malingering in a case study of amnesia, has been reported by Kopelman [19]. Are AC and DD valid examples of psychogenic and organic amnesia? In the case of AC, neuroradiologi- cal exams : CT, MRI and a resting state SPECT the latter having been described as being more efficient at localizing brain dysfunction than is EEG [29] showed no evidence of anomalies. However, this absence of physical proof does not necessarily qualify AC s syn- drome as being psychogenic. A psychogenic inter- pretation should rest on positive history, not only on the absence of demonstrable organic factors [7, 8]. In AC s case, her three-year abusive relationship and her psychiatric history (depression, panic disorder, suicidal attempts, hysterical and obsessive-compulsive traits) give stronger support to a psychogenic than neurogenic hypothesis. Furthermore, psychogenic amnesia may occur as a protective mechanism in persons contem- plating suicide and psychogenic loss of memory acts as an alternative to suicide in some patients [11, 41]. AC s loss of memory occurring some 48 hours after an incomplete suicide attempt appears to exemplify this view. Insofar as AC s drinking habits are concerned, this information does not likely have any etiological relevance on the grounds that there is general agree- ment that even long-term alcohol abuse does not result in isolated RA [4]. The evidence to date leads us to postulate that AC s social environment, psychiatric antecedents and pro- longed states of altered mood may have combined to modulate her cerebral activity in a way that caused per- manent change in the network dedicated to the retrieval of autobiographical memories. Although not yet well understood, a wide range of effects on memory func- tions and on brain regions involved in memory have been attributed to stress [3]. Also, studies showing neu- robiological correlates of the effects of psychotherapy J. Ouellet et al. / Two routes to losing one s past life: A brain trauma, an emotional trauma 37 reinforce the idea that context and cognitive behavior can functionally rewire the brain [33]. We see a number of arguments in support of the con- clusion that DD s amnesia is of neurological origin. In his case, there is an incontestable brain insult and a per- fect contiguity. Indeed, his memory loss followed im- mediately after a focal lesion in the right hemisphere, which is more frequently involved in the retrieval of episodic information than is the left hemisphere [9, 21, 26]. Furthermore, exhaustive psychosocial and repeat- ed psychiatric assessments of the patient revealed noth- ing in his pre- or post-morbid history to suggest a psy- chogenic contribution to his amnesic condition. Five neurologists, two neurosurgeons, two psychiatrists, and three psychologists examined DD over a 15-year peri- od. They all carefully considered and finally rejected the psychogenic hypothesis on the basis of his back- ground and clinical profile. Moreover, DD exhibits on- ly 4 of 23 features considered by Kapur [16] to support a psychological basis to a retrograde amnesia. Those features are : 1. disproportionate severity in regard to lesion, 2. absence of diffuse brain pathology, 3. loss of basic personal semantic knowledge, and 4. failure to recognise as familiar, members of his family. The fact that DD did not recognize as familiar, pictures of himself at a younger age, nor pictures of his family, may indeed appear psychogenic-like since it is usually assumed that the loss of self-sense does not happen in organic amnesia. It must be noted that Kapur s features do not include more recent, post-1999 cases that do not conform to this characterisation [31]. An interest- ing and genuine counter-example of this argument may be found in a paper from Meltzer [30]. The author, a psychologist, suffered a cardiac arrest which resulted in anoxia and partial retrograde amnesia, a loss of past memories and the feeling of not quite exactly knowing anymore who he was. This partial loss (or more com- plete loss as in the case of DD) in the case of anoxia, could lead to difficulties such as not recognizing one- self in old pictures or not being able to answer some questions about personal values, as was the case for DD when he completed the MMPI. To our knowledge, one other patient has been re- ported with an extensive and isolated retrograde amne- sia following a circumscribed thalamic lesion. JG, a 33-year old man, showed a dense, remote memory im- pairment after having suffered a likely infarction in the right thalamus [31]. MRI images yielded evidence of a more recent thalamic lesion involving the right medial region and an older one involving bilateral posterome- dial regions. Psychiatric investigation revealed no evi- dence of a functional aetiology or malingering. From a clinical point of view, it is of particular interest that JG showed a reverse temporal gradient and a loss of some aspects of his prior procedural knowledge, both features being quite rare in retrograde amnesia, in addi- tion to a loss of some semantic knowledge. The authors concluded on the crucial role for the right mesiodorsal region of the thalamus in the ability to access remote memories. It is very unlikely that DD could be malingering, es- pecially in the face of his unchanged, twenty-six year- long state of amnesia. Also, there was no evidence of secondary gains. If there was at attempt for emo- tional or financial compensation for his dysfunction, he would not likely have gone back to work with such effort and persistence only a few months after his ac- cident. Furthermore, DD went on to live a normal and autonomous widower s life, after his wife s death in 1993, an attitude that does not seem typical of a per- son who would have been simulating amnesia in order to escape responsibilities. Our tentative hypothesis to explain DD s invasive amnesia in the presence of such a focal brain lesion is that the latter may have disrupt- ed the structures and mechanisms devoted to the re- trieval and reconstruction of autobiographical memo- ries. It remains to be determined if there are specific regions specialised in the retrieval of remote souvenirs and if so, their localization. A role for the thalamus in coordinating cortical networks involved in conscious recollection has been put forward [2, 24]. We believe that an interesting way to promote a better understanding of FRA would be to extend the approach described in this paper and directly compare patients with FRA of organic and psychogenic origin, using functional imaging soon after the onset of the amnesia, in order to control the relearning of personal memories. Aknowledgement We wish to thank the patients AC and DD, and their relatives, for their collaboration. References [1] R. Barbarotto, M. Laiacona and G.

Na> Key-Chung Park? Received: May 23, 2007 Accepted: October 28, 2007 Published online: July 16, 2008 *Department of Neurology, Kyung Hee Medical Center, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, and Department of Neurology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea Dear Sir, Fornix is a principal tract of the Papez circuit, interconnecting the hippocampus with the anterior thalamic nuclei directly or via the mammillary body. A fornix le- sion disconnects the memory circuit that runs from the temporal to the frontal lobe, causing severe anterograde amnesia [1-3]. Memory impairment in those patients was characterized by anterograde amnesia, recognition better than recall and pre- served procedural memory. To our knowledge, of 4 reported cases with a localized fornix lesion [1-4], only 1 patient was described having memory def- icits for a retrograde event [4]. However, the patient retained the ability to recall past events, while only confusing their temporal order. We evaluated a patient who suddenh sociated with an isolated fornix lesion. Case Report A 65-year-old right-handed man with 6 years of education developed abrupt memory loss and personality changes, such as apathy and indifference, 2 weeks before visiting our memory disorder clin- ic. He had worked as a miller for 25 years and had no history of cognitive impair- ment. Two weeks prior to his visit, he sud- denly began to ask the same questions re- petitively, often forgetting orders from customers, and would have his employees to roast sesame too much without consid- ering the size of the order. The family thought he seemed strange because he showed no anger when one of his employ- ees, who had worked for him for more than 10 years, moved to a neighboring mill without telling him. His medical history was remarkable for a small infarction of the posterior limb of the right internal capsule with consequent mild left lower extremity weakness 17 years previously as well as for medication-controlled diabetes mellitus arising 3 years earlier. On examination, the patient appeared alert and cooperative but unaware of his memory deficits. He correctly answered questions on personal information, such as his social security number, telephone number, and home address. However, he could not remember recent events, such as how he had visited the clinic and what he had eaten for lunch 1 h before. On Mini- Mental Status examination, he could not recall 3 words that he had registered only a few minutes before, scoring 20/30 due to additional problems with orientation in time and place and the last step of the Se- rial Seven Test. The severity and content of cognitive decline were investigated by detailed neu- ropsychological tests using a standardized battery called the Seoul Neuropsycholo- gical Screening Battery [5]. The patient s scores are given in table 1. He was able to repeat 6 digits forward but only 2 digits backward. His performances on spoken and written language were normal as were those on 10 items of praxis and on tasks for the Gerstmann syndrome. However, the patient was impaired at confrontation naming as assessed by the Korean version of the Boston Naming Test. Copying abil- ity tested with the Rey-Osterrieth Com- plex Figure was intact, but immediate re- call and delayed recall were impaired. Ver- bal memory, as assessed by the Seoul Verbal Learning Test, was also impaired, not perform the recognition section of the Seoul Verbal Learning Test because he did not even re- member he had done its learning section. On the free recall concerning the presi- dents of Korea, he responded to only 2 of 9 (he could not recall the name of the cur- rent president) . Frontal/executive func- tions, including controlled oral word as- sociation and Stroop Color-Word Interfer- ence Test, were severely impaired. We suspected that the patient s remote memory was compromised, since he could not recall the previous and current presi- dents. Questions about significant events in his personal history were formulated to evaluate the retrograde amnesia in further detail.

Although his son had already finished army duty 10 years before and graduated from univer- sity more than 5 years previously, the pa- tient confabulated that his son was serving in the army and was presently going to university. In fact, his son had got married 30 months before and the granddaughter had been born 20 months previously. How- ever, he said that his son had got married 10 months before and the granddaughter had been born 20 months earlier. 156 Eur Neurol 2008; 60: 155-158 In order to investigate the semantic as- pect of remote events, we administered the previously published Korean Public Event Recall Test that consists of 10 famous pub- lic events per decade from 1966 to 1997 in Korea [6]. When asked to answer questions with a single word or a short phrase, the patient showed correct responses only once in 30 questions. Subsequently, when forced to choose 1 of 4 choices, he replied correctly to 11 of 30 questions (3 in 1966- 1975, 4 in 1976-1985, 4 in 1986-1997) . Fourteen age- and education-matched controls with no history of neurological and psychiatric illness were also tested. The average performance scores were 13. 7 + 3. 7 in free recall and 21. 2 + 3. 1 (75 + 1. 2 in 1966-1975, 6. 9 + 1. 4 in 1976-1985, 6. 9 + 1. 6 in 1986-1997) in the multiple- choice paradigm. A gadolinium-enhanced MRI taken 15 days after symptom onset revealed a mass involving the hippocampal commissure, the body, and the anterior column of the bilateral fornices (fig. 1) [7]. An endoscopic biopsy performed 22 days after the onset proved the mass to be a diffuse, large B cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy and radiother- apy were performed based on the result of the biopsy. A detailed neuropsychological test was not assessed again, but his son re- ported that the characteristics of the amne- sia were unchanged 3 months after onset. Discussion Our patient differed from previously reported cases with localized fornix le- sions [1-3], showing severe retrograde am- nesia. As stated in the introduction, there has been 1 case report where the patient showed difficulty tagging the order of past events chronologically, while retaining the ability to recall the contents of past events [4]. Unlike these patients, ours failed to re- call personal events of at least the past 10 years with a temporal gradient. This retro- grade amnesia was not limited to the epi- sodic component of events but also ex- tended to the semantic aspect of events. That is, our patient had decreased knowl- edge of public events that had happened in the past 30 years and also decreased se- mantic knowledge of words as demon- strated in impaired naming on the Boston Naming Test. The underlying mechanisms of retro- grade amnesia associated with fornix le- sion remain to be elucidated. In the previ- Yoon/Na/Park GP KF VW, Cac Ill oe Fornix (column) =o1) Fig. 1. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI axial (a) , sagittal (b) and coro- nal (c) images of the patient show that lymphoma invades the for- nix selectively and completely along the long axis and the septum pallucidum only partly.

The fornix has dense connections with the me- dial region of the frontal lobe including the septal area and diagonal bands as well as anterior thalamus and mammillary body. Thus, the mechanism of retrograde amne- sia associated with the fornix lesion might be attributable to the failure of the frontal lobe to retrieve the past memory stored in medial temporal areas because of the dis- connection of the frontal lobe from the hippocampus [8]. Our observation that the patient was better at the recognition part than the free recall part of past public Retrograde Amnesia Associated with Fornix Lymphoma events may partly support this hypothesis. Alternatively, we cannot completely ex- clude the possibility that the lymphoma in our patient invaded structures adjacent to the fornix. Retrograde amnesia has been reported in patients with a lesion in the subcortical septal nuclei in the basal fore- brain, such as the diagonal band of Broca and the nucleus accumbens [9, 10]. How- ever, we considered that these structures were not involved after mapping of the gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the lesion by superimposing on 2 schematic coronal sections from the neuroanatomical atlas (uj. One of the characteristics of our pa- tient was frontal behavior such as apathy and indifference. Personality changes with a fornix lesion have been reported in only 1 case study in which the patient showed impulsiveness, aggressiveness, binge eat- ing and hypersomnia [3]. The patient, however, had injuries not only to the for- nix but also to the hypothalamus. It has been reported that lesions in frontal-basal areas of the brain, such as the septal nucle- us, the accumbens nucleus, the innomi- nated substance, and the anterior and me- dial thalamus, are associated with person- ality changes [12, 13]. It is also well known that branches of the fornix send informa- tion to the septal area and the anterior and medial thalamus. Thus, we posit that apa- thy and indifference in our patient might be partly related to the disruption of the circuit connecting these structures. Eur Neurol 2008; 60: 155-158 157 The extent of the fornix lesion in our patient was different from that of previo studies. The fornix consists of the crus, t commissure, the body, and the anteri cases were mainly confined to the anteri part of the fornix (anterior column or t bo involving not only the anterior part as previous cases (anterior column and t bo as the fornix proceeds from the body to t anterior column, it sends out several branch fibers, terminating in different target sites such as the septal area, the anterior and lat- eral dorsal thalamic nuclei, the mamm: lary body, and the medial nucleus of t thal pez circuit with a lesion at the level of t columns [7].

The injury to both ante- rior and posterior parts of the fornix in our patient may explain why he had severer amnesia involving both anterograde and retrograde events than previous cases.

Subependymomas are benign neo- plasms intimately related to the ventricular system which only exceptionally associate hemorrhagic events. We present neuroradiological and pathological eviden- ces of intratumoral hemorrhage within a single case of subependymoma operated on at our institution. Additionally we analyze retrospectively the well-defi- ned reports of similar cases published in the scientific literature. Case report. A 71-year-old man on anticoagu- lant therapy presented with abrupt and progressive deterioration of his level of consciousness. Emergent computed tomography and magnetic resonance ima- ging evidenced signs of acute bleeding within a mass located at the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, producing obstructive biventricular hydrocephalus. The lesion was immediately and completely removed through a left frontal transcortical approach. Patho- logical diagnosis was consistent with subependymoma displaying areas of microhemorrhage. After surgery the patient developed global anterograde and retro- grade amnesia. Conclusions. A spontaneous hemorrhagic event within an asymptomatic lateral ventricle subependy- moma can result in a surgical emergence as a conse- quence of sudden obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pathways. Prompt and radical surgical removal of the mass, which allows a rapid resolution of hydrocephalus and prevents the risk of rebleeding, may constitute the safest management strategy.

Introduction Subependymomas are low-frequency tumors that Hemorrhagic subependymoma of the lateral ventricle appear near the ventricular system and spinal cord. They are characterized by a benign clinical course, the rate of symptomatic subependymoma being estimated in a 40% approximately*!'. Only exceptionally does this kind of tumor present an aggressive behaviour' . Spontaneous hemorrhage associated with these lesions represents an exceedingly rare event that may cause a rapid and severe neurological derangement in the patient. In this report, we present a single case of subependymoma displaying a spontaneous acute intratumoral hemorrhage, which was surgically removed on an emergency basis at our institution. We have performed a systematic review of clinical series and well-described single reports of subependymomas, analyzing the features and out- come of those cases associating tumoral bleeding. Case report A71 year-old man was brought to the emergency depar- tment of a primary hospital by his relatives, after suffering an abrupt-onset episode of disorientation, incoherent speech and memory deficit. He suffered from arterial hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation, so he was being treated with acenocumarol. An emergent brain computed tomography (CT) was obtained, demonstrating a solid mass near the left foramen of Monro, with signs of both intratumoral and intraventricular acute hemorrhage. There were also signs of active biventricular obstructive hydrocephalus (fig 1) . During the transfer to our neurosurgical department, the patient presented a progressive deterioration of his Figure |. Preoperative CT, showing a 3 x 2. 5 cm mass loca- ted at the left frontal horn, near the foramen of Monro. It causes displacement of the septum pellucidum and obstruc- tive biventricular hydrocephalus, predominantly affecting the left ventricle, with signs of transependymal edema. The lesion is solid, lobulated and shows mild heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. It displays a heterogeneous signal with high density areas corresponding to recent intratumoral hemorrhage. A cerebrospinal fluid - blood level can be visualized at the left occipital horn, corresponding to intraventricular hemorrhage (B) . Neurocirugia 2010; 21: 478-483 Figure 2.

The tumor was completely removed through a left frontal transcortical approach assisted by neuronavi- gation (fig 3) . An external drainage was left at the lateral ventricle for five days. After the surgical procedure, the patient recovered pro- gressively his normal level of consciousness. Nevertheless, he presented both temporal and spatial disorientation, and episodes of agitation. In addition, the patient exhibited anterograde and retrograde memory impairment with confabulation. The pathological study was diagnostic for subependymoma displaying areas of hemorrhage (fig 4) . The postoperative MRI study confirmed a complete resection of the mass was achieved (fig 2, C-D) . The last follow-up assessment of the patient, performed nine months after the surgical procedure, disclosed an improve- ment in his memory performance, so he was able to learn 480 Neurocirugia 2010; 21: 478-483 Figure 4.

The radiological characteristics of subependymomas are non-specific, making a definite preoperative diagnosis difficult. Aggressive features such as peritumoral vasoge- nic edema, mass effect, hemorrhage and dense enhance- ment indicating high vascularity are rare findings (12%) \"'. Overall ten cases of a subependymoma presenting with a hemorrhagic event have been reported in the literature (table 1) . Among these cases, three patterns of hemorrhage can be distinguished: pure intratumoral, pure extratumoral (intraventricular and/ or subarachnoid) , and finally those subependymomas associating signs of both intra and extratumoral bleeding. The mechanism of spontaneous intratumoral bleeding within a subependymoma remains unclear'*, Personal antecedents predisposing to hemorr- hage have only been described in the case reported by Di Lorenzo (arterial hypertension) and in our own case (anti- coagulation) . It is surprising the fact that during the surgi- cal procedure, most authors describe the subependymoma displaying radiological signs of intratumoral bleeding as an avascular mass, being the hemorrhage only demonstrated in the microscopic study. Most of these pathological des- criptions include the presence of dilated capillaries, areas of recent microhemorrhages and/ or the presence of hemo- siderin-ladden macrophages, indicating old hemorrhage . Only in two cases the presence of large areas of massive intratumoral hemorrhage has been reported . Noteworthy is the absence of these pathological findings within the cases of subependymoma associating a pure extratumoral hemorrhage, being this phenomenon considered by some authors a consequence of tearing of an ependymal or sube- pendymal vein during tumoral growth'*'*. The clinical presentation of hemorrhagic subepen- dymomas depends on the type of bleeding. An acute intratumoral bleeding can produce a sudden increase in the size of the mass, producing acute obstruction of the cere- brospinal fluid pathways, as observed in our patient !>5. Nevertheless, two cases of subependymomas presenting intratumoral areas of old hemorrhage, who only complai- ned of long-term headache without signs of hydrocephalus, have been described>' . In contrast, the presence of extra- tumoral hemorrhage can produce a clinical picture indistin- guishable from that of a subarachnoid hemorrhage?*\"\"\". In this context a lumbar puncture may be performed without excluding the presence of a supratentorial mass, with the evident risk of brain herniation. During the surgical management of a hemorrhagic subependymoma, the neurosurgeon must face two pro- blems, namely hydrocephalus and tumoral removal, almost always being on the diagnostic suspicion of an aggressive 482 Neurocirugia 2010; 21: 478-483 Figure 5.

It is our opinion, coincident with the attitude sustained by most authors, that a prompt tumoral removal can solve immediately both problems, avoiding shunting procedures and preventing new hemorrhagic episodes. The surgical approaches to the ventricular system performed by different authors managing hemorrhagic subependymomas were tailored depending on tumoral location and are summarized in table 1. Technical details have been extensively described elsewhere and are out of the scope of this report'?. Six hemorrhagic subependymomas were completely removed. A partial removal was achieved in two cases, one of them presenting a fatal episode as a consequence of massive re- hemorrhage of the residual tumoral mass . One additional fatality was described in a patient who presented with mas- sive intratumoral hemorrhage and could not be operated'*. Neurological sequels were detected in three patients after the surgical procedure. Among them, one patient pre- sented a left homonymous hemianopsia as a consequence of a parietal transcortical approach to the ventricular atrium . Yamasaki et al. , reported an anterograde memory deficit after a transcallosal removal of a lesion located at the left frontal horn, probably as a consequence of damage to the ipsilateral fornix' . Our patient presented disorienta- tion, agitation and a global memory deficit with confabula- Hemorrhagic subependymoma of the lateral ventricle tion in the acute phase that gradually improved over nine months of follow-up. The discrete residual lesion disclosed on the MRI (fig 2D and 2E) involved the left septal nuclei, the anterior comissure, the diagonal band of Broca, the pre- optic area and anterior hypothalamus (fig 5) . This kind of basal forebrain lesion, mainly seen after removal of tumors and hemorrhage from anterior com- municating aneurysms, tends to produce memory deficits which are less severe than those observed in patients with medial diencephalic or mesial temporal lobe damage, and characteristically do not affect non - declarative memory! ' , It has been postulated that the amnesia follo- wing basal forebrain damage can be a consequence of the interruption of the cholinergic innervation that the nuclei located in this anatomical region provide to the hippocam- pus and neocortical areas'*' ' , Nevertheless, the presence of clinically evident memory dysfunctions seems to depend on a combination of basal forebrain nuclei and fiber tracts lesions rather than on damage to a single structure' .

WATSON (From the Department of Neurology and the Center for Neuropsychological Studies, University of Florida College of Medicine, USA) SUMMARY A 39-year-old man developed retrograde and anterograde amnesia following haemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation situated near the splenium of the corpus callosum. MRI studies demonstrated damage to the splenium, and to a region containing the retrosplenial cortex and the cingulate bundle. The fornix was anterior and inferior to the site of maximal damage, but may have been involved; the stria terminalis was probably spared. Structures known to be important in memory but spared by the lesion included the hippocampus, thalamus, and basal forebrain. The retrosplenial cortex receives input from the subiculum and projects to the anterior thalamus, thus providing an alternative route between hippocampus and thalamus. Perhaps more importantly, medial temporal structures involved in memory receive anterior thalamic input directly via the cingulate bundle and indirectly through a relay in the retrosplenial cortex. We suggest that this thalamocortical portion of Papez circuit may be important in memory, and that lesions of the cingulum and retrospleniat cortex may cause amnesia by disrupting this pathway. INTRODUCTION In 1977, Heilman and Sypert described a patient who developed severe amnesia in association with the growth and removal of a pilocytic astrocytoma near the trigone of the lateral ventricles. These authors postulated that the memory disturbance was caused by involvement of the fornix bilaterally. They recognized that fornix lesions in humans had not consistently been associated with amnesia; however, they argued that, first, cases of alleged normal memory following fornix transection were not well studied neuropsychologically and, secondly, lesions of the posterior fornix interrupt connections between the fornix and thalamus that would be spared by lesions of the columns of the fornix. Authors arguing against the importance of the fornix in memory have discounted Heilman and Sypert s evidence on the grounds that only surgical observation was available to document the extent of the lesion, and that other structures, such as the temporal stem or the posterior hippocampus, might have been involved by the tumour or by surgery (Horel, 1978) . We now report a patient with amnesia associated with haemorrhage from an Correspondence to: Dr Edward Valenstein, Department of Neurology, J.

For convenience, we have referred to this area as the retrospinal region, although the actual retrosplenial cortex is only one of the structures in this region. Neuroradiological studies in our case demonstrate no lesions in the hippocampus, temporal stem, or stria terminalis, and it is possible that the lesion did not involve the fornix. It unquestionably destroyed the cingulate bundle and retrospinal cortex, structures that were also involved in the case reported by Heilman and Sypert. These two structures have strong anatomical connections with structures known to be important in memory, raising the possi- bility that lesions restricted to the retrosplenial area can be associated with amnesia. CASE REPORT On March 15, 1984, T. R. , a 39-year-old right-handed college-educated accountant, awoke with a severe headache. He was confused, and pyrexial, with a stiff neck and decreased memory. Lumbar puncture yielded blood-stained CSF. He was transferred to the Shands Teaching Hospital, University of Florida. His past medical history and family history were noncontributory. Nine months before the onset of his illness he had moved from California to a responsible post in the offices of a large corporation in Florida. On admission (March, 15) his temperature was 38 C, and his blood pressure 118/90 mmHg. He had moderate meningism, was somnolent and orientated only for person. He recalled only | of 3 objects in 5 min, and had difficulty performing the serial 7s test. Spontaneous speech, comprehension and repetition were normal. He had a right homonymous hemianopia, full extraocular movements and normal pupillary responses. The rest of the cranial nerves were normal. He had no abnormal motor signs or alteration in reflexes and pain sensation was intact. Urine and blood studies, including clotting studies, were normal. A CT scan showed blood in the ventricular system and an intracerebral haemorrhage just lateral to the splenium on the left (fig. 1) . An angiogram showed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) both above and below the splenium in the pericallosal cistern and the cistern of the velum interpositum, extending into the medial aspect of the trigone of the left lateral ventricle (fig. 2) . Feeding vessels arose from interhemispheric branches of the left anterior and posterior cerebra! arteries, and from choroidal branches of the left posterolateral choroidal artery. He was treated with dexamethasone, cimetidine, phenytoin and analgesics. He slowly became more alert. Repeat CT scans on March 21 and 29 demonstrated disappearance of the intraventricular blood and partial resolution of the intracerebral haemorrhage. There was slight ventricular enlargement. Fifteen days after admission, he was alert and cooperative. He was orientated for place, person and year, but was unsure of the month. He remembered | of 3 objects after distraction, but did not recall the other 2 even with multiple choice. He had no recollection of the events of his illness, and he was very uncertain about time relationships before his illness; for example, he could not remember if he had moved to Florida before or after Christmas. Spontaneous speech was fluent, without errors, and repetition and naming were normal. He made occasional errors on calculations, but right-left orientation and finger naming were normal. He had signs of a mild callosal disconnection. Although he made only occasional errors reading aloud and reading comprehension for short commands was normal, he sometimes failed to read correctly items in his left visual field. His writing was normal with his right hand; he made occasional errors with his left hand, but could type correctly with the left hand the same sentences that he had difficulty writing. He had some difficulty drawing with the left hand, but he was not apraxic with either hand.

Visuospatial abilities were intact. With his right hand, he could draw a cube and a rudimentary map of Florida, and could correctly indicate the location of major cities. He performed the cancellation task normally with either hand. He had a partial right superior quadrantanopia to confrontation, and variable left visual field extinction on bilateral simultaneous stimulation. He could accurately count fingers on either side, and he could name colours in either visual field. Extraocular movements and optokinetic nystagmus were normal, as was the remainder of his neurological examination. On April 5 the AVM was removed through a left occipitoparietal craniotomy. After several bridging veins along the interhemispheric fissure were divided, the left occipital lobe was retracted laterally, exposing the splenium. The posterior pericallosal artery was followed to the AVM, which was surrounded by an old haematoma. Using microdissection techniques the AVM was removed. The fornix was not directly visualized during the operation. He remained somnolent postoperatively. A CT scan showed intraventricular blood with increased ventricular size. On April 6 ventriculostomy was performed. Three days later he was still somnolent, but could name objects placed in his left hand and was not apraxic. He then became unresponsive. The ventriculostomy continued to drain blood-stained CSF. He was treated for suspected meningitis, although only one CSF culture was positive (anaerobic streptococcus) . He gradually improved, and by April 23 he was alert, but had a more extensive retrograde amnesia than preoperatively. He was discharged on April 28. On June 15, formal visual field testing demonstrated a partial right superior homonymous quadrantanopia. Eleven months after his haemorrhage he tried returning to work on a limited basis, but he was unable to perform his previous work because of memory limitations. Although improving, he has significant memory deficits 2 yrs after his haemorrhage.

Details of the most comprehensive testing are given in the Appendix. We will first consider testing performed preoperatively and within 4 months of surgery. During preoperative and early post- operative testing, he was alert, attentive, and socially appropriate. With the exception of an increase in the span of his retrograde amnesia from 9 months preoperatively to 4 yrs postoperatively, differences between preoperative and early postoperative testing were minimal. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (Wechsler, 1981) , his verbal IQ was 118 preoperatively and 115 postoperatively; his memory quotient of 84 preoperatively was significantly reduced compared with his verbal IQ. All language and language-related functions were intact, as was performance on tasks associated with frontal-subcortical functions (i. e. , Verbal Fluency (Benton, 1968; Lezak, 1976) , Proverb Interpretations, Stroop, Visual-Verbal Test (Siegel, 1957) ) . The single exception was poor performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (Milner, 1963; Robinson er al. , 1980) : abnormal preoperative performance on this test was thought at the time to reflect difficulty in remembering the categories that he was sorting. In contrast to these preserved functions, he had a profound amnesia. Retrograde amnesia was present at the onset of his illness. He could recall none of the events surrounding his illness, and he thought he still worked in another state. His retrograde amnesia transiently increased postoperatively to encompass more than 4 yrs: he did not remember the birth of his second child (aged 4 yrs) , believing he had only one child. His remote memory, however, appeared intact, as assessed by the Albert Remote Memory Battery (Albert ef a/. , 1979) . At 6 months postoperatively, his retrograde amnesia had shrunk back to a span of 9 to 12 months. His anterograde amnesia was profound. For at least 6 months after the onset of his illness, he had virtually no recall of episodic personal information. By lunch he could not recount reliably what he had done that morning. When asked how he felt, he would say that he had improved dramatically from the day before, that everything yesterday was a fog , and that he had now reached a new level of consciousness and clarity . Formal assessment of recent memory confirmed this clinical impression: he was severely impaired across all verbal memory tasks, both with auditory and visual presentations. Story recall of the Logical Memory stories from the Weschler Memory Scale I (Wechsler, 1945) was 6 immediately (average normal = 10) , but zero after a 30 min delay (average normal =8) : no information was recalled and there was no overt recognition that stories had previously been presented. Paired associate learning from the Wechsler Memory Scale was impaired and none of the hard associaies were learned. He was similarly impaired on word list learning tasks (California Verbal Learning Test (Delis et a/. , 1983) ) , recalling no more than 5 of 16 words. After a 30 min delay, both cued and free recail of the California word list were zero. In contrast, he performed much better on nonverbal recent memory tasks, such as the Milner facial memory task (Milner, 1968) , and the Benton visual recognition task (Benton, 1974) . Immediate and delayed recall of the Rey Osterreith figure (Lezak, 1976) , however, was abnormal. Follow-up testing Tests performed 7 months after his haemorrhage showed improvement in his memory quotient and paired associate learning. Twenty to 22 months after his haemorrhage, his full scale IQ had increased to 125, but his memory quotient remained more than 20 points below his verbal IQ, indicating isolated memory impairment. He recalled none of the logical memory stories on the Wechsler memory test after a 30 min delay, and on the California Verbal Learning Test he recalled only 3 of 16 words after distraction without delay, and zero of 16 with a 30 min delay, and his performance on the Peterson-Peterson auditory consonant trigram memory task was at least as impaired at 22 months as it had been 3 to 4 months after the haemorrhage.

R. s amnesia is similar to the classic amnesic syndromes described with bitemporal or diencephalic lesions (Butters and Miliotis, 1985) . He had severe anterograde amnesia: he initially was disorientated, and remembered very little about daily events. His anterograde amnesia began to improve about 5 months after the haemorrhage, so that by 7 months he was usually orientated as to place and day, but even after 2 years he was unable to carry on the responsibilities of his previous job, and performed poorly on standardized tests of recent memory. He also demonstrated a circumscribed retrograde amnesia. Although he did well on some tests of remote memory (the Albert Remote Memory test and the Florida recent/remote memory battery) , he had difficulty recalling with appropriate clarity and specificity personal memories for events occurring in the past 4 years, as demonstrated on a personal autobiographical test of memory. Finally, he -had remarkably intact general intellectual functions: there were no consistent deficits on tests of frontal lobe function, and language, praxis, and visuospatial functions that did not rely on memory were intact. T. R. s memory deficit was to some extent material-specific. Verbal tasks showed a consistent deficit; while tests of nonverbal memory, except for the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, were performed normally. Poor performance on the Rey Osterreith Complex Figure task, however, is seen in both right and left hemisphere- damaged patients. While T. R. had an abnormal rate of forgetting for verbal material, the rate of forgetting for nonverbal! material was not significantly different from controls (see Appendix) . The results are compatible with the proposal that the predominantly left-sided lesion in this case affected verbal more than nonverbal memory. More detailed consideration of the results of neuropsychological testing of this patient are to be reported separately. Localization Although T. R. has a classic amnesic syndrome, extensive neuroradiological studies demonstrated that the lesions associated with his intracerebral haemorrhage spared the areas classically associated with amnesia: there were no lesions seen in the diencephalon (Victor et a/. , 1971; Squire and Moore, 1979; Speedie and Heilman, 1982, 1983; Graff-Radford et a/. , 1984; von Cramon et al. , 1985; Rousseaux er al. , 1986) or basal forebrain (Whitehouse et a/. , 1981; Alexander and Freedman, 1983; Volpe and Hirst, 1983; Damasio et al. , 1985; Hepler er al. , 1985) , and both medial temporal lobes (Scoville, 1954; Scoville and Milner, 1957; Cummings er al. , 1984; Zola-Morgan et al. , 1986) were free of evidence of a destructive lesion. The small lucency in the anterior hippocampus on the left (see fig. 3p) probably represents anomalous vessels: it remained lucent on T2 MRI studies (spin echo sequence: 2000ms pulse repetition time; 90ms echo delay) , suggesting either calcium or blood, but it was not visible on the CT scan or LZ0Z 49q0}90 6Z UO Jasn AueIqIT jooyS Me7 PyenJeH Aq 6/SLSP/LE9L/9/01 L/ajome/ulesq/woo'dno siwepece//: sdyy wo. pepeojumoq 1636 EDWARD VALENSTEIN AND OTHERS Fic. 3.

Coronal sections at 6mm intervals encompassing the entire extent of the temporal lobes showed no other lesions. There were no lesions involving neocortex and subcortical damage was confined to the site of the principal lesion, plus a small lesion at the site of a temporary ventricular shunt in the right dorsolateral frontal lobe. The CT study (fig. 1) , the angiogram (fig. 2) and the MRI studies (fig. 3) all locate the pathology near the splenium of the corpus callosum. Two MRI scans, performed 3 and 9 months after the onset of his deficit (and 2 and 8 months after operation) demonstrated a defect in the splenium of the corpus callosum, and an LZ0z 49q0}90 6Z UO Jesn AyeIgIq JOoYDS Me PlemeH Aq 6/SLSP/LE91/9/0 1 L/elolwesulesq/woo'dnoo1wapece//: sdyy wos pepeojumoq RETROSPLENIAL AMNESIA 1637 adjacent lesion posterolateral to the splenium, involving the cortex and subcortical white matter between the splenium and trigone of the left lateral ventricle. This is the location of the most posterior portion of the cingulate gyrus, which is composed principally of the retrosplenial cortex. In the white matter deep to this cortex runs the cingulate bundle. The neuroradiological studies lack the resolution to identify with certainty whether certain small structures, such as the fornix and stria terminalis, were damaged. In the ventricle, the fornix runs anterior and inferior to the site of maximal damage, but may have been damaged, and the hippocampal commissure, directly beneath the splenium may also have been involved. The stria terminalis, adjacent to the caudate nucleus in the inferolateral wall of the lateral ventricle, was lateral to the lesion, and was probably spared. There was no radio- logical or clinical evidence to suggest right hemisphere involvement. Pathogenesis of T. R. s amnesia Damage to one or more of the above-mentioned structures is presumably respon- sible for T. R. s amnesia. Memory loss sometimes occurs after section of the corpus callosum (Dimond et al. , 1977; Bentin et al. , 1984) . This has been attributed to associated damage to the fornix and/or the hippocampal commissure, or to disconnection of the left hemisphere from the right medial temporal region in patients with dysfunctional left medial temporal structures (associated with seiz- ures) (Ross, 1980) . The first mechanism might apply to our patient, and will be discussed below. The second appears unlikely; there is little to suggest that our patient s left hippocampus was dysfunctional, and even if it were, a small lesion in the splenium would not be sufficient to disconnect the left hemisphere from the right hippocampus. Patients with cerebral infarctions in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery may also present acutely with amnesia (Geschwind and Fusillo, 1966; Damasio and Damasio, 1983) . These patients sometimes have lesions in the splenium; however, when amnesic, they always have associated damage to medial temporal structures (Damasio and Damasio, 1983) . Although their lesions often extend anteriorly to involve at least a portion of the hippocampus, they may also involve the retrosplenial cortex and cingulum, and the mechanism of memory loss may thus be similar to that in our patient. Lesions of the bodies of the fornix (fig. 4, lesion 1) disconnect the hippocampus from the septum, anterior thalamus and mamillary bodies. Fornix lesions in monkeys produce mild memory impairment (Gaffan, 1974; Owen and Butler, 1981; Moss et al. , 1981; Carr, 1982; Bachevalier et a/. , 1985a, 5) . Fornix lesions in humans have had variable effects on memory. There are reports of definite memory impairment after surgical section (Sweet et al. , 1959; Hassler and Riechert, 1957) or trauma (Grafman et al. , 1985) , and there are also reports of normal memory after surgical section (Dott, 1938; Cairns and Mosberg, 1951; Garcia Bengochea et al. , 1954) or destruction by tumour (Woolsey and Nelson, 1975) . The reports of normal memory have not included careful neuropsychological testing. Heilman and Sypert (1977) also pointed out that surgical section of the columns of the fornix LZ0z 49q0}90 6Z UO Jesn AyeIgIq JOoYDS Me PlemeH Aq 6/SLSP/LE91/9/0 1 L/elolwesulesq/woo'dnoo1wapece//: sdyy wos pepeojumoq 1638 EDWARD VALENSTEIN AND OTHERS Fic. 4, Semidiagrammatic representation of Papez circuit, indicating the position of the retrosplenial area in this circuit. | and 2 indicate sites of hypothetical lesions discussed in the text.

(fig. 4, lesion 2) may spare memory because projections from the hippocampus directly to the anterior thalamic nuclei and to the septal area leave the fornix before the site of the lesion. Since in both humans and animals, section of the fornix has been associated with at most mild impairment of memory, it would be difficult to ascribe the severe memory loss suffered by the patient of Heilman and Sypert (1977) to fornix lesions alone. The lesion in their patient, however, also involved the retrosplenial cortex and cingulum. It may be that combined lesions of the fornix and these latter areas produce a more profound amnesia than lesions restricted to the fornix. Finally, it should be kept in mind that while it is virtually certain that the cingulate bundle and retrosplenial cortex were involved by T. R. s lesion, we have no proof that the fornix was affected. It is therefore possible that all the memory deficits in the present case might need to be explained by factors other than fornix damage. The retrosplenial cortex, architechtonically transitional between the allocortex of the hippocampus, and the isocortex of the posterior cingulate cortex, lies in the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus between the subiculum-presubiculum and the posterior cingulate cortex (area 23) (Vogt, 1976; Braak, 1980) (fig. 5) . Anteriorly, it is contained in the inferior bank of the posterior cingulate gyrus; posteriorly, it extends onto the medial surface of the hemisphere, Research.

Spl=splenium. primates, but it is clear from observations in various species that retrosplenial cortex is richly connected both to the anterior thalamic nuclei and to medial temporal structures. In the rabbit, the principal projections of the anteromedial and anterodorsal thalamic nuclei are to the granular retrosplenial cortex, while the anteroventral nucleus projects principally to the agranular retrosplenial cortex (Robertson and Kaitz, 1981; Jones, 1985) . The lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus (considered to be one of the anterior thalamic nuclei) projects strongly to the cingulate cortex, agranular retrosplenial cortex, and presubiculum and para- subiculum (Jones, 1985) . It has been demonstrated in monkeys and rodents that the retrosplenial cortex has reciprocal connections with subiculum and _ pre- subiculum and projects back to the anterior and lateral dorsal thalamus (Domesick, 1972; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977; Sorensen, 1980, Schwerdtfeger and Sarvey, 1983; Vogt and Miller, 1983) . The fibres connecting the retrosplenial cortex with the thalamus and medial temporal lobe structures are carried in the cingulate bundle (Mufson and Pandya, 1984) . A lesion of the retrosplenial cortex and underlying cingulate bundle would therefore interrupt an alternative pathway from hippocampus to anterior thalamus (via the retrosplenial cortex) . Perhaps more importantly; such a lesion would also interrupt input from the anterior and lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei to retrosplenial cortex and medial temporal lobe (fig. 4) . This lesion might substantially disrupt communication between the anterior thalamus and hippocampus, and thus may have an effect similar to lesions in either of the structures that it disconnects.

The patient was treated with curative intent with high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine chemotherapy according to local guidelines. Following her second cycle of treatment she remained nauseated with poor oral intake; during the third cycle the patient experienced extreme emesis for 13d that was poorly controlled with maximal anti-emetic therapy. On recovery the patient sought a high-carbohydrate intake including large amounts of carbonated soft drinks. Three days after improvement of nausea she experienced an episode of severe, culture-proven sepsis associated with fluctuating confu- 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, British Journal of Haematology, 149, 896-918 899 british journal of I) Correspondence sion. The confusion was initially attributed to her sepsis, but an alternative cause was sought when this did not settle with antimicrobial therapy (fusidic acid, doxycycline and vancomy- cin) . Mild hypomagnesaemia was the only notable metabolic abnormality. Two successive computerized tomography scans demonstrated post-chemotherapy vascular changes in the right frontal lobe mass, but no new structural cause. Lumbar puncture was contra-indicated due to recalcitrant thrombocytopenia. After 17 d magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated classical findings of severe Wernike Encephalopathy (WE; Fig 1) . Ocular signs were absent, although a mild, transient cerebellar syndrome had been documented during the second cycle of chemotherapy, 2 months previously. Parenteral thiamine was administered. The patient devel- oped multi-organ failure due to sepsis and was transferred to the intensive care unit and recovered. Eight weeks following her presentation with confusion she continues to suffer with profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia and fluctuating confusion. Her lymphoma remains in remission with no further treatment. WE is an acute, neuropsychiatric syndrome first described in 1881 by Carl Wernike in two alcoholic males and a woman who developed severe vomiting due to pyloric stenosis following sulphuric acid ingestion. Neuropathological studies demonstrate that the classical clinical triad of confusion, ataxia and ocular abnormalities is present in only 16% of cases and that 80% of cases are only diagnosed at post-mortem (Sechi & Serra, 2007) . Thiamine stores are sufficient for 18d, beyond which enzymes requiring thiamine pyrophosphate as a co-factor are impaired. In acute WE, a sudden fall in central nervous system (CNS) thiamine causes oedema and haemorrhage in the peri- aqueductal grey matter, mamillary bodies and medial thala- mus. High signal in these areas on T2-weighted MRI images has a sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 93% for WE, making MRI scanning the most useful diagnostic modality (Antunez et al, 1998) . In addition hypotension, tachycardia and hypo- thermia are recognized due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In chronic thiamine deficiency a peripheral neuropathy may predominate (dry beri beri) . High or low output cardiac failure (wet beri beri) is more commonly seen in Asians (Sechi & Serra, 2007) . Chemotherapeutic drugs including ifosfamide (Buesa et al, 2003) , erbulozole (Van Belle et al, 1993) , and 5-fluorouracil (Cho et al, 2009) can deplete thiamine reserves. Known precipitating factors for acute WE include carbohydrate loading, tetracycline use and hypomagnesaemia (Sechi & Serra, 2007) . All of these were present in our case and in many patients undergoing therapy for PCNSL. Importantly, the neurological manifestations of the condition may be ascribed to the underlying lymphoma, delaying replacement therapy. Optimal therapy for WE is controversial; consensus opinion recommends treatment with a minimum of 500 mg parenteral thiamine per day, continued until there is no further neurological recovery (Sechi & Serra, 2007) . Thiamine is inexpensive, safe and easy to administer. Concerns about growth-promoting effects on paediatric tumours are not supported by available evidence (Lee et al, 2005) . The outcome from acute WE, however, is poor with an estimated untreated mortality of 17% and 80% of patients developing Korsakoff's dementia (Sechi_& Serra, 2007) characterized by severe memory defects. Every effort should therefore be made to prevent this complication in at-risk groups. We present a case of acute WE resulting in Korsakoffs syndrome complicating the therapy of PCNSL. The patient was predisposed by hyperemesis and we believe her decline was precipitated by a combination of glucose loading, sepsis, tetracycline use and possibly hypomagnesaemia. Clinical Fig 1. (A) Pre-treatment MRI for comparison. (B) There is periaqueductal high signal extending into the hypothalamic region and mamillary bodies on the T2-weighted images. No enhancement is seen post contrast (not shown) . The appearances are consistent with thiamine deficiency/Wernicke encephalitis. The differential diagnosis would include a paraneoplastic syndrome. 900 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, British Journal of Haematology, 149, 896-918 suspicion was clouded by her pre-existing neurological state and concurrent sepsis causing diagnostic delay and significant morbidity. We believe that these predisposing events are common to all patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy for CNS lymphomas and that this complication is under-recog- nized. Evidence shows that cancer and its treatment is the leading case of WE in the paediatric population and that the diagnosis is commonly missed (Vasconcelos et al, 1999) . We propose that prophylactic, parenteral thiamine should be administered to all patients receiving second-line anti-emetic therapy during high-dose chemotherapy for CNS malignancy.

However, due to the low proliferative activity of plasma cells (PCs) and limited bone marrow (BM) infiltra- tion, it is difficult to obtain abnormal karyotypes in this disorder. In addition, the resolution of conventional cytogenetic analysis makes it impossible to recognize cryptic translocations. The advent of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) , especially when performed on malignant PCs, enabled the rapid detection of recurrent and prognostically significant aberrations. Translocations involving the [GH gene located on 14q32 are recurrent, with a prevalence of about 40-50% in MM, and result in juxtaposition of oncogenes from partner chromo- somes to IGH. At least 30 different partners have been reported, and some of these translocations are karyotypically cryptic. The recurrent partners involved in the so-called primary translo- cations include CCND1 (11q13) , WHSC1/FGFR3 (4p16) , MAF (16q23) , CCND3 (6p21) , MAFB (20q12) , MAFA (8q24) and CCND2 (12p13) . These have been reported in 15%, 15%, 5%, 2%, 2%, <1% and <1% of MM respectively, and can be detected from the stage of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (Chng eft al, 2007) . These translocations may actually define MM subtypes with distinct prognosis. Indeed, whereas the t (11; 14) and the t (6; 14) are associated with a standard risk, the t (4; 14) and t (14; 16) predict a short overall survival, especially when conventional treatment, i. e. not including any of the newer therapeutic agents, is used. However, little clinical data is available for the rare translocations, including the t (14; 20) (q32; q12) . Here, a series of 1600 patients displaying MM or related PC disorders was routinely analyzed by interphase FISH between September 2002 and September 2009, and the demographic, clinical and cytogenetic features of the patients with the t (14; 20) were analyzed. FISH was performed either on immunologically identified PCs, using cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light chain immuno- fluorescence with simultaneous FISH analysis (clg-FISH) , or on purified CD138 positive PCs. For the purpose of analysis, <10% PCs in the BM were considered insufficient for testing. The European Myeloma Network (EMN) recommendations for cut-off points were used (http: //www. cytogenetics. org. uk/ 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, British Journal of Haematology, 149, 896-918 901"

Hodges! and Rosaleen A. McCarthy \"University of Cambridge Neurology unit and the 7Department of Experimental Psychology, Cambridge, UK SUMMARY A patient with a chronic amnesic state resulting from bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction showed a pattern of retrograde amnesia not previously reported. Personally Televant autobiographical memory was profoundly impaired, whereas knowledge of famous people and public events was relatively spared. Furthermore, knowledge of famous people, including the ability to make accurate temporal judgements, was less affected than knowledge of public events. In addition, we have documented a severe and systematic distortion of personal memory. These findings are not compatible with current accounts of retrograde amnesia based either upon the type of information stored (e. g. episodic versus semantic memory) , or upon simple storage versus access models. We propose an explanation based upon an interactive cognitive model in which the patient shows a disorder at the thematic retrieval framework level of memory organization due to a disconnection of frontal and medial temporal memory systems. INTRODUCTION Retrograde memory disorders are important for two distinct levels of theory. From the perspective of neurobiology, those cases whose disorder arises from focal damage provide unique and critical information regarding the architecture and cerebral substrata of human memory systems. From the perspective of the cognitive scientist, retrograde disorders provide a unique opportunity for examining the bases of memory organization and the programming of memory retrieval. be attributable to the obliteration of some storehouse of information (Mair et al. , 1979; Warrington and Weiskrantz, 1982; Markowitsch, 1984, 1988; von Cramon et al. , 1985; Graff-Radford et al. , 1990) . If dissociations arise in the context of diencephalic amnesia then they are likely to have been caused by a failure in communication between cerebral . In the parlance of cognitive science, the patients deficit is more likely to be one of impaired access or retrieval, rather than degradation or loss of information. A considerable number of patients with thalamic infarction resulting in persistent amnesia have now been reported (Graff-Radford et al. , 1984, 1985, 1990; Winocur et al. , 1984; von Crammon et al. , 1985; Stuss et al. , 1988) , but the overwhelming emphasis in these studies has been on the anterograde aspects of memory. Only six reports, totalling nine patients, have included any quantitative assessment of remote memory. Analysis of the data on these nine cases, summarized in Table 1, shows that eight had evidence of retrograde memory impairment. Although there is little controversy about the presence of retrograde memory loss in such cases, its characteristics are less well established. In most instances only one or two tests of remote memory were employed, and there has been only one attempt to assess autobiographical memory (Stuss et al. , 1988) . Description of the qualitative aspects of the memory impairment have been scanty in all cases. Studies of anterograde amnesia of diencephalic origin have clearly shown task- and material-specific dissociations (Warrington and Weiskranz, 1968) . Anterograde amnesia TABLE 1.

Schacter, 1987; Shimamura, 1989; Weiskrantz, 1990) . These dissociations provide compelling evidence for a major distinction between subtypes of anterograde memory. In the domain of retrograde memory disorders, the evidence for fractionation and for dissociations between different types of memory is less well established. This is partly because of the difficulties inherent in testing premorbid memories, and partly because there has been a tendency to emphasize memory age rather than memory type . Thus, while the core question in studying anterograde amnesia has been, Why do amnesics forget most things but remember others? ; in the case of retrograde memory a major issue has been, What is the extent and duration of their retrograde amnesia? Since a single factor model of memory is no longer acceptable in analyses of the anterograde disorder, it is appropriate to be suspicious of its validity in the case of retrograde amnesia. Indeed, even as early as 1975 there was evidence of heterogeneity in the syndrome. A dissociation between recall and word completion in famous name retrieval was demonstrated in the medial temporal lobe case H. M. (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975) . As a working framework we have adopted a heterogeneity hypothesis similar to that which has proven so very fruitful in analysing the anterograde amnesic syndrome. Retrograde memory loss may affect different types of memory in different ways. Indeed, there may even be more than one forgetting gradient depending on the class of memory and/or on the specific type of testing procedure employed to assess that memory. Of course, there may also be substantial differences between individual patients depending on the pathology involved. In this regard it is of note that previous single-case studies. of retrograde amnesia for whom neuropathological correlation has been attempted have either involved patients with Herpes simplex encephalitis who have medial temporal lobe damage, or cases of alcoholic Korsakoff s syndrome. Single-case analyses have allowed an exploration of the quantitative and qualitative attributes of patients autobiographical knowledge, as well as their recall and recognition of public events (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Baddeley and Wilson, 1986; Butters and Cermak, 1986; Warrington and McCarthy, 1987; McCarthy and Warrington, 1993) . In some cases it has been possible to construct objective and verifiable measures of memory accuracy by reference to written autobiography, family photograph albums and inter- views with close family members. These investigations have demonstrated task-specific dissociations in retrograde amnesia that appear to bear at least a superficial resemblance to those shown in anterograde tasks. There is also growing evidence for material-specificity. Knowledge of word meaning, facts about other people and personal semantic information appear to be relatively spared. Knowledge of public events and even major personal events appear to be gravely impaired. Further fractionations are hinted at in the literature and in particular there are pointers to suggest that personal memories may be different from public events (De Renzi et al. , 1987) . These dissociations are critical for gaining an understanding of the neurobiological and the cognitive basis of amnesia. The data from these detailed analyses of single cases have demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in the status of various aspects of retrograde knowledge both within an individual patient and also perhaps between different individual cases. In so far as such differences between patients may be correlated systematically LZ0z Jequia}des 6} UO Jesn Ayeiqr] pueney Aq GLLSrb/LZ6/P/9 | L/alome/ulesq/woo'dnooiwapeces/: sdyy Woy papeojumoq 924 J. R. HODGES AND R. A. McCARTHY with pathology, they have the potential for stimulating the development of cognitive neurobiological theories beyond the level of descriptive taxonomies. Clues to the properties of the memory impairment are not restricted to quantitative characteristics; patients also clearly differ markedly in the qualitative aspects of their recall of retrograde information. In some patients, questions about their personal history may simply elicit empty recall such as don t know responses, or stereotyped but skeletal information. In others, memory errors consist of paramnesic confabulations that have little or no grounding in externally verifiable or objective events. The patient s recall may be disordered, muddled and in some cases delusional (e. g. Baddeley and Wilson, 1986) . There may also be individual differences in the spontaneity with which paramnesic errors are produced. In some patients they are generated spontaneously, whereas in other cases they only arise in response to direct questioning (Berlyne, 1972) . The cognitive bases of these confabulatory phenomena have received relatively little attention. At a very broad level, empty recall and paramnesic autobiographical memory errors appear to be correlated with damage to different anatomical sites. Empty recall of premorbid episodes has been documented following Herpes simplex virus encephalitis with medial temporal lobe damage (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Warrington and McCarthy, 1987; McCarthy and Warrington, 1993) . The precise localizing significance of paramnesic disorders is less certain but seems to implicate the frontal or fronto-thalamic systems. The presence of confabulations has been documented as a primary or prominent sign following ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm (Logue et al. , 1968) , in post- encephalitic frontal and subcortical lesions (Damasio et al. , 1985) and in the context of restricted thalamic infarction (Stuss et al. , 1988) In this paper we shall describe our experimental analyses of a severe and persistent confabulatory retrograde amnesia that arose in the context of circumscribed thalamic lesions. The patient s remote memory deficit appeared to be constrained both by material, and by the way in which the material was assessed. CASE REPORT P. S. , a 67-year-old, right-handed garage proprietor was admitted to Addenbrooke s Hospital, Cambridge on June 12, 1989 in coma. He had retired to bed the night before with his wife as normal, but the following moming was unrousable. There was no evidence of drug overdose. He had been in good general health with no history of cerebrovascular disease. Alcohol consumption was at most modest. Following admission he remained in coma for <24 h. The following physical signs were then observed: absent pupillary reflexes, marked bilateral ptosis with an inability to voluntarily open his eyes and paralysis of vertical eye movements. No other abnormal signs were elicited. Upon recovery of his conscious level, he was noted to be severely confused, disorientated in time and place with marked impairment in new learning capacity. No language or perceptual abnormalities were noted. Full investigations on admission were normal including a CT brain scan, EEG and CSF examination. A subsequent MRI scan obtained in October 1989 documented symmetrical bilateral thalamic infarction in the territory of the paramedian artery (see Fig. 1) . The lesions involved the dorsomedial nuclei as well as the internal medullary lamina and the mamillo-thalamic tract bilaterally. The parafasicular nuclei and the retrofiex fascicle may also have been damaged (anatomical details courtesy of Professor D. Y. von Cramon) . He remained in hospital for a month. When discharged in July 1989 he was fully alert but exhibited features of a profound memory disorder which has persisted ever since. His retention of new information remains negligible and he has a extensive retrograde amnesia encompassing the whole of his adult life (see below) . There has also been a marked change in his personality; having been a vigorous and successful garage owner and a keen member of various business clubs, he is now apathetic and lethargic. He is content to LZ0z sequiaydas 6) uO Jesn Ayeigi puemeH Aq SL Lebb/LZ6/P/91 L/elole/ulesq/woo'dnoolwapece//: sdy}y Woy pepeojumoq AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AMNESIA 925 Fic. 1.

He lacks insight into his deficits and denies any cognitive impairment. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT The results of standard clinical neuropsychological tests are shown in Table 2. The level of measured IQ was commensurate with his estimated premorbid level, as judged by the National Adult Reading Test (Nelson and O Connell, 1978) . His short-term (immediate) memory for verbal and spatial information was normal. In contrast, all tests of longer- term memory demonstrated profound impairment; on the Recognition Memory Test (Warrington, 1984) his performance was at chance level. Similarly he showed no reten- tion of verbal material from the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler and Stone, 1945) . Although able to copy the Rey-Osterrieth figure (Osterrieth, 1944) , his retention of this non-verbal information after a delay was minimal. Tests of language showed no significant impairment. His description of the cookie jar theft picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983) demonstrated normal articulation, phonology and syntax without word-finding difficulty or paraphasic errors. Performance on the difficult Graded Naming Test (McKenna and Warrington, 1983) was in keeping with his estimated intellectual level. On the shortened 36-item Token Test he made only two errors, both of these in the last block, which is within normal limits.

Retrograde memory Between July 1990 and January 1991 we systematically explored P. S. s remote memory by means of a series of tasks designed to probe personal and public memory, using both pictorial and verbally presented material, and free recall and cued recall procedures. The patient and his wife gave informed consent for these experimental investigations of remote memory. Autobiographical memory Free recall. Clinically, the most striking feature of P. S. s autobiographical memory is his persistent belief that he is currently in the navy on active service, but away from his boat on shore leave. He usually states that he was called up two years ago at the start of the war. Details of his naval career (1941 1946) are related accurately, although he claims to have been married with two children before entering the navy, when in fact his children were all born after he left the navy. Despite realizing that he is aged over 60 years and was born in 1922, he still persists in the claim that he is on active navy service. At home he frequently mentions rationing and restricted travel and torments his wife by insisting on a nightly blackout. Using a semi-structured interview technique, we documented a temporally extensive deficit in autobiographical recall. He can relate facts about his early life such as place and date of birth, schools attended, names of teachers, first job and war service record. However, he is unable to furnish specific details of major personal events such as his own wedding (e. g. date, name of church, best man s name) . For events after 1945, he recalls a few very salient occurrences but virtually no details. He can usually recall that he has three children, but is vague and variable about their place of birth and where he was at that time. He knows that he owns two garages, and that they are now run by his sons, but the sequence of their purchase and further details about the business elude him. When asked anything about family or business events over the past few decades he repeats stereotyped factual accounts that lack any experiential component. Cued recall. Using the Galton Crovitz technique (Sagar er al. , 1988; Hodges and Ward 1989) we administered 15 high frequency nouns (e. g. train, house, book, car, etc. ) and asked him to describe a personally experienced and unique episode relating to each word. Despite extensive encouragement and cueing he did not produce a single specific episode. Instead, general facts about his early life and navy service in the 1930s and 1940s were related, but without any of the richness of detail or self-reference that normally characterizes the recall of personally experienced autobiographical episodes. Each episode was scored for richness and temporal specificity on a O 3 point scale according to previously described guidelines (Sagar et al. , 1988; Hodges and Ward, 1989) : P. S. obtained a mean score per episode of 1. 5; normal controls score 2. 840. 2 (Hodges and Ward, 1989) . LZ0z sequiaydas 6) uO Jesn Ayeigi puemeH Aq SL Lebb/LZ6/P/91 L/elole/ulesq/woo'dnoolwapece//: sdy}y Woy pepeojumoq 928 J. R. HODGES AND R. A. McCARTHY Qualitatively similar responses were obtained using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman er al. , 1989) . In this task, subjects are asked to generate personal semantic information (names of school friends, teachers, occupations, addresses, etc. ) as well as episodes from three life periods (early: pre-school and school; mid: first job, marriage, birth of children; late: recent holidays, hospital admissions, etc. ) . P. S. was able to produce a normal amount of semantic information from the first life period, was markedly impaired on the second and produced virtually no information from the third. Despite encouragement, he remained unable to produce any specific episodic material. Family photograph identification. The patient s wife supplied us with 28 photographs of events containing 17 family members and close friends (holidays, weddings, dinners, etc. ) from the 1970s and 1980s. The photographs were presented in a random order and the patient was asked about the people and events portrayed in each. P. S. did not recognize any of the events. He identified only six of 17 people and made a number of major errors, misidentifying for instance his grandchildren and close long-standing friends. He mistook a fairly recent Masonic dinner for his own wedding. Cued recall of family events. With the help of his wife, we compiled a list of 12 major family events from the past three decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s) including births, weddings, business deals, holidays, etc. Using these we constructed a cued recall task. For each item (e. g. your holiday in Tenerife ) we asked first for spontaneous recall using the labels generated by his wife. Then, if P. S. was unable to produce any details, we administered a standard cue (e. g. it was when the hotel flooded and there was a power cut ) . P. S. produced virtually no correct details even in the cued recall paradigm and made many confabulatory errors. Incidents were typically incorporated into his navy service schema in that he thought that most of the events had occurred whilst he was in the navy on location, often in the Caribbean where he had served in the war. In summary, tests of autobiographical memory indicate a profound deficit in recalling specific life events whether using a clinical interview format, the Galton Crovitz word association technique, the Autobiographical Memory Interview, or cueing with family photographs, or named family events. P. S. shows some preservation of semantic information about his early life, but even salient facts about his own life after 1940 are related inconsistently. The persistence of a paramnesic state of delusional proportions in which he believes that he is still on active service in the navy is the most striking clinical observation. It is against this background that we embarked upon a parallel investigation of his remote memory for public events and famous faces. Public remote memory Famous people Famous faces test. The original version of this task, which was based on the Famous Faces Test of Albert et al. (1979) , has been described in detail elsewhere (Hodges and Ward, 1989; Hodges, 1991) . It has now been updated to include the 1980s and consists of 72 portrait photographs, 12 per decade, from the 1930s to the 1980s. The photographs were presented in pseudo-random order so that each block of five contained one photograph LZ0z sequiajdas 6} uO Jesn Ayeiqiq puensey Aq SL L8rb/LZ6/P/9L L/elole/ulesq/woo'dnoolwapece//: sdyjy wos pepeojumoq AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AMNESIA 929 from each decade. P. S. was first asked to name the person representing a particular decade. If unable to do so, he was asked to identify them by description and encouraged to be as specific as possible (e. g. in response to a politician , he was asked What party was he in? or Which position did he hold? etc. ) . Finally, a forced choice of three names from the same era and category were presented for recognition (e. g. Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Ted Heath) . Thus, three scores were obtained: (i) naming, (ii) identification and (iii) forced-choice recognition. P. S. named only 12 of the 72 and showed evidence of a modest gradient (see Fig. 2) . However, in the second part of the test he identified 55 of the 60 unnamed faces by their correct superordinate category (i. e. politician, film star, etc. ) . Of these, 41 responses included very specific and often uniquely identifying information (e. g. Princess Diana, She married Prince Charles ; Ronald Reagan, He s the American President who was an ex-film star ; Terry Waite, He is the church going man held in the East ; Benito Mussolini, The Italian ex-war leader ) . In the third (forced choice recognition) part of the test, he chose the correct name in 53 out of 60 (88%) instances. 100 90 80 70 s Naming * o identification Forced Choice } 6 # 0 x 2 10 +4920 1030 1040 1060, 1980 1970 1980 1980 Decade Fic. 2.

McCARTHY This updated version of the Famous Faces Test was given to 15 age and educationally matched normal control subjects. P. S. s score for naming fell more than two standard deviations below normal (P. S. 16. 7%; controls 36 96%, mean 77. 6 +9. 6%) . By contrast, his score for identification (taken as the total correctly named plus those accurately identified) was above normal (P. S. 93%; controls 68 100%, mean 89. 0+9. 6%) . Similarly, his score for recognition, taken as the total correctly named plus those correctly recognized, was also within the normal range (P. S. 90. 3%; controls 83 100%, mean 94. 2 +6. 8%) . Famous names: definitions and dating. To ensure that the information P. S. generated about the people in the Famous Faces Test was not merely general semantic information deducible from the photographs, on a subsequent occasion we administered the 72 names of the people depicted in the Famous Faces Test and asked him to describe the people again in as much detail as possible. For 71 names (99%) he gave the correct superordinate category (politician, film star, etc. ) , and for 60 (83. 3%) he generated highly specific or unique information (e. g. John Profumo, He was in the government, a Tory, had an affair with some tart ; Michael Heseltine, An MP, one of Maggie s crowd ; Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister three was famous most recently. Then, the sequence was repeated and he was asked which was famous longest ago. As shown in Table 3, P. S. was correct on 49 out of 54 trials (91%) . The same experiment was repeated using the names, rather than photographs, of the same individuals. For the names, P. S. was correct on 44 trials (81. 5%) . Eight age-matched and educationally matched normal control subjects were given this test. P. S. s scores were entirely normal (see Table 3) . We found these results so remarkable that we replicated them using a further set of name triplets that had previously been shown to be sensitive to retrograde amnesia (Warrington and McCarthy, 1988) . On these items, P. S. scored 20 out of 24 (83%) .

F. R. with medial temporal damage from Herpes simplex encephalitis scored only eight out of 24 (33%) which is at chance. Comment. In contrast to his performance on tests of autobiographical memory, P. S. shows striking preservation of knowledge about famous people from all eras. Although poor at naming famous faces, he can generate specific identifying semantic information in the majority of instances whether tested using faces or names. His ability to distinguish famous faces and names from non-famous foils is extremely good. Even more remarkable is his ability to place triplets of faces and names in their correct sequence, although his ability to date individual names is severely impaired. Famous events Famous events: recognition and dating. The Famous Events Test used has been described in detail elsewhere (Hodges and Ward, 1989; Hodges, 1991) . In brief, the test consists of the names of 100 news items; 50 true events from the 1930s to the 1970s (e. g. the Profumo affair, the Watergate scandal, the Mau Mau, etc. ) , and 50 fictitious events made up to sound authentic (e. g. the Goldberg affair, the Jin Jin, the Blackheath murders, etc. ) . The subject is asked merely to say which of these events are true and then to date these to a single decade. For normal subjects, the recognition part is very easy and scores approach 100%. P. S. endorsed 38 (76%) which is more than four standard deviations below normal on this test (Hodges and Ward, 1989) . In addition, he also endorsed 15 of the foils (i. e. 30%) which gave him an overall score approaching chance. His dating was correct only for the events from the 1940s and this is artefactual since all events were judged to have occurred either during or shortly after World War II. Overall, his dating ability fell more than four standard deviations below normal on the test (Hodges and Ward, 1989) . Famous events: photograph identification and dating. To compare identification of famous events with his performance on the Famous Faces Test, we selected 26 photographs of very famous events taken from a popular chronicle of the twentieth century. The events were distributed evenly from the 1930s to the 1980s. P. S. correctly identified only four events (the Jarrow March, King Edward VIII s abdication speech, the coronation of Queen LZ0z sequiaydas 6) uO Jesn Ayeigi puemeH Aq SL Lebb/LZ6/P/91 L/elole/ulesq/woo'dnoolwapece//: sdy}y Woy pepeojumoq 932 J. R. HODGES AND R. A. McCARTHY Elizabeth II, the assassination of John F. Kennedy) . In the remainder, he correctly identified the person depicted in six of the 11 photographs showing people. The events he described only in non-specific (generic) terms using visual information present in the photographs. In many cases he spontaneously confabulated. For instance, when shown a picture of the mushroom cloud and the destruction of Hiroshima, he responded that it must have been a bomb, probably dropped on South America or China by the Germans. Cueing appeared not to help, but merely elicited further confabulation. The eight normal controls used in the recency judgement experiment were also given this task. They accurately identified between 20 and 25 of the scenes depicted with a mean of 22 (+2. 2) . Thus, P. S. s score (four out of 26) fell below four standard deviations of normal on this test. Dating was also severely defective (below four standard deviations) . Only the events from the 1930s and 1940s were correctly dated. However, this again reflects response bias since he judged all events to have occurred just before, during or shortly after the war. Famous events; recency judgement. For direct comparison with P. S. s recency judgement for famous people, we took 42 events from the Famous Events Test and combined them into 14 triplets containing events from three consecutive decades (e. g. the Abdication crisis, the Berlin air-lift, the Mau-Mau, the Great Train robbery, the Watergate scandal, the Falklands war) . The same procedure as that described for the Name Recency Test was employed. P. S. was first asked to judge the most recent from each triplet, then all the triplets were repeated and he was asked to judge the least recent item from each. As shown in the Table 4, his overall performance was 13 out of 28 (i. e 46% versus a chance level of 33%) . The same eight normal control subjects who had undertaken the Name Recency Judgement Test were also given this task. Their scores ranged from 20 to 27 out of 28 (mean 24 + 1. 9) . Thus P. S. s score fell more than four standard deviations below normal. A comparison of P. S. s performance on the Famous Name and Famous Events Recency Judgement tests revealed a significantly better performance on the Famous Faces 62 = 10. 83, P = 0. 001) . By contrast, the percentage obtained by controls on the two tests was virtually identical. Comment. P. S. s preservation of specific semantic information about famous people appears not to generalize to other domains of public knowledge since his performance on tests of famous event identification (from name and photograph) is extremely poor. Furthermore, his ability to sequence famous events is significantly worse than his ability to perform comparable judgements about famous people. TABLE 4. COMPARISON OF P.

The amnesia was of acute onset yet appears to affect all of the patient s adult life. These observations allow us to conclude that the minimal pathological cause of a severe retrograde amnesia is a bilateral diencephalic lesion. We can, therefore, infer that the loss of remote memories in Korsakoff s syndrome is likely to be a primary consequence of damage to thalamic and mamillo-thalamic regions rather than a secondary effect of long-term alcohol toxicity. In this regard our conclusions are in accord with those of Butters and Cermak (1986) . Our patient, P. S. , shows material specificity in his retrograde amnesia; that is, his amnesia is more pronounced for some types of information than others. Personally relevant information and autobiographical knowledge appear to be more severely affected than the knowledge of famous people and public events. With the exception of knowledge of information about himself, P. S. s knowledge of people is less affected than his knowledge of events. Moreover, his knowledge of public figures is better preserved than his knowledge about people with personal relevance. This profile of impairment is counter-intuitive and poses difficulties for any simple model of amnesia. We consider that the data allow us to do more than simply challenge current frameworks. Rather, we wish to argue that they allow us to present a synthesis of neuro-scientific and cognitive evidence which sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying the amnesic syndrome. In our investigations we have documented a severe and systematic distortion in personal information. The most striking clinical observation is P. S. s persistent claim to be home from the navy on leave from active service during World War II. This claim has a delusional intensity and is resistant to contrary evidence and argument. On directed questioning, P. S. can recall some factual information about his early life, knows that he is married, knows his occupation and when directly questioned can retrieve a few favourite tales and isolated themes; however, this information is fragmentary, has to be elicited and is not, or cannot be, spontaneously integrated into a coherent life-story. In addition to this distortion of personal semantic information, we have shown that P. S. has a marked impairment of personal autobiographical knowledge. He cannot give details about major family occurrences such as the birth of his children and his grandchildren, their weddings or divorces. In recalling episodes he confuses and confabulates information when questioned directly. His deficit goes beyond a failure to recollect family events. He has very grave difficulty in recognizing photographs of his family, gets confused in recalling which of his children is married or single and can neither recall their jobs and careers nor say who is the parent of his grandchildren. Indeed, his wife claims that his memory of virtually all of their married life has been lost as a result of the stroke. P. S. s knowledge of personal and public events is gravely impaired. His knowledge of famous events is extremely weak, and their recall is characterized by confabulation. By contrast, P. S. s recall of information about famous people appears to be relatively better preserved. His memory for famous people is sensitive to the way in which information is elicited. Although he is unable to name individuals, he can detect and recognize their names, he can provide very detailed definitional accounts of who they are and can say why they are famous. P. S. is unable to recall when the people were famous, but, remarkably he is able to place named or photographed individuals in appropriate date order. In direct contrast to his performance with famous people, P. S. LZ0z Jequiaydes 6} UO Jasn Ayesqr] pueneHy Aq SLL 8pb/LZ6/P/9 1 L/ajomme/ulesq/woo' dno siwepece//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq 934 J. R. HODGES AND R. A. McCARTHY is unable to discriminate famous from fictitious events and cannot order the occurrence of events in time. How should this (hitherto undescribed) profile of deficit be understood? In framing our account we first wish to consider two main psychological or cognitive theories of amnesia and confabulation. A popular way of characterizing amnesic deficits has been in terms of the semantic versus episodic memory distinction (Tulving, 1983) . Thus, retrograde amnesia can be thought of in terms of an impairment of episodic knowledge with relative sparing of semantic memory. On initial consideration we thought that P. S. seemed to fit this dichotomy quite well. His grave difficulties with tests of personal and public episodic memory appear to be relatively isolated: he does not have the impairment of word-meaning or object recognition which is characteristic of patients with a primary loss of semantic memory (Warrington, 1975; McCarthy and Warrington, 1988; Shallice, 1988; Hodges et al. , 1992) . There is, however, evidence of impaired recall of personal semantic information, including seminal personal facts such as details about his children s births and his businesses. P. S. s episodic recall is clearly impaired. However, detailed testing demonstrated that some aspects of P. S. s episodic knowledge were better than would be expected on an account positing a simple loss of episodic memory. In particular, P. S. has good knowledge of temporal information about individuals at least as assessed by the relative date-order task knowledge that would seem to require some ability to access an episodic record. Furthermore, his episodic memory is not simply lost or subtracted, rather, it is distorted via his persistent fixation on the navy theme. Recall of facts about his own life is confabulatory and consistently distorted within his navy framework. Although it would be possible to formulate a multiple deficit account of P. S. s retrograde amnesia within the episodic/semantic model such an explanation would fail to capture the qualitative characteristics of his disorder. Another possible cognitive account of P. S. s retrograde amnesia focuses on the confabulatory aspects of the disorder. Confabulation may be a direct consequence of a frontal lobe or dysexecutive syndrome. For example, Shallice has proposed that con- fabulation may arise because of a general failure to check the products of a memory search against plausibility criteria or other memory records (e. g. Shallice, 1988; Delbecq- Derouesne et al. , 1990) . P. S. does show impairment on tests considered sensitive to frontal lobe damage, so it is plausible to speculate that his confabulations might represent one facet of a more pervasive impairment in cognitive monitoring. Whilst a failure to check or monitor possibly contributes to P. S. s problems, it does not explain, or characterize, the very specific and systematic distortion that we have documented. An executive system failure could account for a non-specific tendency to confabulate, but it would have more difficulty in explaining the temporally biased nature of P. S. s confabulations or their characteristic content (phenomena that have been consistently demonstrated in the 3 years since P. S. s stroke) . We would suggest that part of P. S. s problem lies in his criteria for checking rather than in his ability to check per se. Thus he correctly accepts information retrieved from the 1940s but incorrectly accepts that from later epochs. He appears to be working with an erroneous set of checking assumptions and these preclude normal or adequate monitoring and evaluation of memory products. The two main candidate cognitive theories for interpreting P. S. s retrograde amnesia, namely the episodic/semantic theory of amnesia and the frontal dysexecutive theory of confabulation, do not seem to offer a suitable interpretation of P. S. s difficulties. We are therefore led to suggest an alternative account. In developing such an alternative theory LZ0z Jequiaydes 6} UO Jasn Ayesqr] pueneHy Aq SLL 8pb/LZ6/P/9 1 L/ajomme/ulesq/woo' dno siwepece//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AMNESIA 935 we have been guided and constrained by the neurological evidence and by contemporary cognitive science. If a patient shows a grave retrograde amnesia on the basis of a restricted thalamic lesion it is implausible to propose that she/he has lost a memory store of some kind. A priori, there is insufficient neuronal space in the media] thalamus for a store of one s adult life memories! Rather, as discussed in the Introduction it seems more plausible to attribute such dense impairments to failure of a critical link or component within a closely integrated memory system. The neurological account of this disorder might plausibly be cast in terms of a disconnection syndrome; that is, in terms of a failure to link anterior and posterior cerebral processing systems via the thalamo-frontal neural tracts (Warrington and Weiskrantz, 1982) . The memory system of the brain requires the integrated operation of anterior and posterior systems in order for effective retrieval of memories to occur. So, P. S. s deficit can be construed as a retrieval failure (or partial failure) . However, simply categorizing this retrograde disorder as a retrieval problem fails again in capturing its characteristics at a cognitive/behavioural level. Contemporary cognitive theories of autobiographical memory emphasize the view of memory as a complex integrated retrieval and storage system (e. g. Baddeley, 1990) . The overall process of retrieval and remembering is viewed as a dynamic cognitive operation involving problem solving, cross-checking, verification and inference (e. g. Norman and Bobrow, 1979) . Memory information is not simply read out from a store, but is recon- structed in accordance with task demands and with reference to recorded information of various sorts. The on procedures supported by the frontal lobes. Contextually independent (semantic) information and individual memories may be represented in temporal and inferior parietal cortical areas (e. g. Shallice, 1988; Weiskrantz, 1990; Hodges et al. , 1992) The qualitative characteristics of P. S. s disorder are consistent with a major disruption of the thematic retrieval framework level of the retrieval process. He appears to have lost, or cannot access, an adequate set of frameworks to index his autobiographical memory LZ0z Jequia}des 6} UO Jesn Ayeiqr puenrey Aq GLL8rb/LZ6/P/9 | L/alome/ulesq/woo dno-oiwapeoey/: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq 936 J. R. HODGES AND R. A. McCARTHY records. So, rather than being able to look-up his memories via a childhood theme, a navy theme, a young married theme, a successful businessman theme (for example) , P. S. is inappropriately stuck with navy as his default framework for reconstructing the past and perhaps for interpreting the present. This is a cognitive disaster from a number of perspectives. First, over the intervening 40 years since the navy theme was appropriate, access to the contents of P. S. s lower level records is likely to have become noisy or degraded, and subject to considerable retroactive interference. His search, retrieval and reconstructive activities are referred by default to relatively weak information. Secondly, P. S. is extremely restricted in the range of verification operations that he can carry out on the results of his memory searches and reconstructions. He is operating on false default assumptions and therefore has no firm ground for with people s names, P. S. is unable to place named events in order. How does P. S. relate to previously described cases with retrograde amnesia? The detailed study of patients with either proven or presumptive medial temporal amnesia (Cermak and O Connor, 1983; Warrington and McCarthy, 1988) as a result of Herpes simplex encephalitis have revealed a pattern of profound impoverishment of personal episodic memory as well as knowledge of events. Patient R. F. R. (McCarthy and Warrington, 1993) showed relative sparing of semantic and lexical information for famous names; but in contrast to P. S. , R. F. R. was at chance when asked to place famous names in date order. In post-Herpes simplex encephalitis cases, the damage invariably involves both medial limbic and temporal neocortical areas. Patients with damage confined to the hippocampus appear to have a relatively limited retrograde amnesia: the most fully documented patient, R. B. , who sustained anoxic damage confined to the CA1 zone of the hippocampus has no appreciable retrograde amnesia despite a moderately severe anterograde memory loss (Zola-Morgan er al. , 1986) . The data on the famous patient H. M. , who underwent bilateral anterior temporal lobectomy for treatment of intractable epilepsy in the 1950s, are much more difficult to interpret. On the basis of clinical observations, he was said initially to have only a very limited retrograde amnesia (Milner et al. , 1968) . Furthermore, on a famous faces test he recognized as many stimuli as controls (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975) . More recently, however, H. M. was given a version of the Galton Crovitz test of autobiographical memory which indicated that his deficit extended to his childhood (Corkin, 1984) . However, this finding should be interpreted with caution since the test was performed ~ 30 years post-operatively. Most of the literature on retrograde amnesia comes from the study of patients with alcoholic Korsakoff s syndrome (see above) . There has been considerable debate concerning the pattern of their retrograde memory loss. It is generally agreed that there is an extensive loss, which has been shown to be temporally graded (at least in those studies that are not subject to floor effects) . Interpretation of these findings is, however, extremely difficult due to the compounding effects of chronic alcohol abuse (arguably causing the poor encoding of new memories over many years) and brain damage beyond limbic structures (see Butters, 1984; Squire, 1986; Butters and Stuss, 1989, Kopelman, 1989) . The findings from our study clearly indicate that extensive retrograde amnesia can result from purely diencephalic lesions. As outlined in the Introduction, relatively few other patients with bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction have undergone assessment of remote memory and there have been no detailed case studies. In the majority of patients reported, however, quite severe retrograde amnesia has been documented (see Table 1) , and in two cases there have been hints that the qualitative characteristics of the disorder were similar to those we have documented in P. S. ; Graff-Radford et al. (1990) mentioned that their most severely amnesic patient had marked problems with the temporal ordering of past memories, and Stuss et al. (1988) note that their patient with bilateral thalamic infarction showed a confabulatory state with features of a reduplicative paramnesic syndrome. One way of viewing P. S. s disorder is in terms of a dysmnesia. Whereas a globally amnesic patient may be quite unable to operate the autobiographical memory system in a coherent integrated way due to the abolition of linkages; P. S. is unusually prone to distortion due to the partial failure of this same system component. As we have noted, P. S. s disorder is most unlikely to have arisen on the basis of a loss of stored memories.

McCARTHY At the level of neurobiology, his pathology appears to point to a partial neural disconnec- tion. Whether this lesion results in a simple failure of information flow between major neuroanatomical components of the memory system, or has the effect of changing the physiological activation balance between different components cannot be determined on the basis of the present evidence. In other words, his deficit may arise either because the lesioned mamillo-thalamic system precludes the flow of information between posterior (temporal) and anterior (prefrontal) areas via the diencephalon, or because of relative hypoactivation in these regions. We are not claiming that all communication between the temporal and frontal regions occurs via the diencephalon, merely that it constitutes a Vital link in the circuitry underlying certain types of reconstructive memory processes. In terms of a cognitive analysis, it seems that P. S. s disorder arises from an inability to use the normal range of indexing procedures that are required for autobiographical memory. His injury precludes a complete dynamic linkage of major thematic memory frameworks with memory records. The partial nature of his deficit results in a paramnesic distortion. Information is transposed and distorted through the lens of one specific and inappropriate framework or life scheme. We suggest that the pattern of retrograde amnesia observed in P. S. with a chronic dysmnesic confabulatory state and profound loss of autobiographical memory, but sparing of specific factual information about famous personalities, should be observable in other patients with vascular diencephalic lesions, if specific tests of the sort employed in this study are used. We can only speculate as to why P. S. may have become stuck in the navy epoch of his life. In this context, it is interesting to note that the qualitative features of P. S. s retrograde amnesia resemble fairly closely those described by Sacks (1985) in his patient with Korsakoff s syndrome, Jimmie G. ( the lost mariner ) , who likewise remained fixed in his wartime naval service days. There seem two very distinct classes of explana- tion for this phenomenon: psychological and neuroanatomical. From the perspective of psychology we may speculate that for P. S. his call-up and wartime service has a close similarity to his present condition in terms of lack of personal control, disruption and trauma. Alternatively there is the possibility that there is something neuroanatomically and/or physiologically special about early adult life memories.

        "other": "These levels of theoretical analysis are complimentary and in this paper we shall present a case whose deficits address a number of outstanding issues in both domains. The most commonly studied cause of amnesia is probably Korsakoff s syndrome occurring in the context of chronic alcoholism. It is now well established that Korsakoff s syndrome leads to an extensive impairment of old memories (retrograde amnesia) , as well as a failure of new learning (Butters, 1984; Butters and Stuss, 1989) . However, attempts to identify the pathological substrates of the retrograde memory impairment have Correspondence to: Dr J. R.

The main problem has been in distinguish- ing the memory disturbances attributable to the diencephalic lesions from the multiple neurological and cognitive complications of chronic alcohol abuse (e. g. Butters, 1985; Squire, 1986; Butters and Stuss, 1989; Kopelman, 1989) . Questions concerning the neurobiological architecture of memory and its cognitive organization are, therefore, best addressed in patients with selective and focal amnesia arising from brain injuries of acute onset. Diencephalic amnesia is perhaps of central importance for theoretical accounts of memory and amnesia.

In addition, he was asked to say when each person was famous; his dating was accurate only for names from the 1940s, but he attributed practically all of the names to this decade. Famous faces and names: familiarity judgement. To establish whether P. S. was able to recognize famous faces as famous, we matched each of the 72 photographs from the Famous Faces Test with a photograph of a non-famous person of the same sex and age and from the same era as the target photograph. These were obtained from a wide range of historical sources. For each pair, P. S. was asked to choose the famous person. Then the whole set was given again in a different order and he was asked to select the non- famous person. His accuracy in the two conditions was 96% and 98%, respectively. The same experiment was repeated using the names from the Famous Faces Test each matched with a fictitious non-famous name. In the two conditions his accuracy was 98% and 88%, respectively. Famous faces and names: recency judgement. The 72 photographs from the Famous Faces Test, plus nine others were arranged in triplets so that each triplet contained three famous faces of the same category (e. g. US Presidents, Prime Ministers, sportsmen, etc. ) and from three consecutive decades. P. S. was then asked for all 27 triplets, to judge which of the operation of the system and its processing is construed by analogy with computer programs that are continually being modified and updated. In terms of organization, retrieval can be thought of as being mediated via hierarchical program structure. At the lowest level are the elements of autobiographical records which may be relatively fragmentary and cognitively unstructured (Morton et al. , 1985) . Memories may become structured and coherent by virtue of operations that are carried out in the processes of retrieval. At the highest level of the program are retrieval frameworks (sometimes termed E-Mops or episodic memory organization packets, Schank, 1982) . The major role of the retrieval frameworks is in providing pointers, and a basic organizational structure, for guiding retrieval and integration of the lower level records. The relationship between the higher and lower levels of the hierarchy can be thought of as being much like the card index system of a library which guides the reader towards books. The higher-level retrieval frameworks are themselves thought to be organized thematically, in terms of major life events or lifetime periods (Conway, 1992) . In essence, by accessing the retrieval framework appropriate to one or other life epoch a major organizational structure is provided that can guide retrieval and reconstruction of more specific autobiographical episodes (e. g. Reiser et al. , 1986; Conway and Bekerian, 1987) . In terms of neurological substrates, it has been suggested that the highest level of memory processing and the dynamic control of memory search both rely checking and cross-checking his retrieval. Thirdly, the navy scheme is inappropriate to and inconsistent with his current life. He is like a person operating on expectations appropriate for visiting the dentist when going into a restaurant. The wrong things will seem significant and memorable and the right things will seem trivial and irrelevant. Failure in accessing the thematic retrieval framework level of autobiographical memory may account both for the observation that P. S. s of events is generally worse than his knowledge of people, and for the fact that his knowledge of personal information is impaired relative to his knowledge of public occurrences. For this explanation to work we need to assume that (i) there are alternative means of accessing and constructing memories at a level below that of thematic retrieval frameworks and (ii) that there are sub-schemes that can be used to retrieve and reconstruct information under alternative headings. Some modes of retrieval will be optimal for some types of information. These assumptions have received considerable empirical support in work with normal subjects and hence it is reasonable to adopt them here (Tulving and Thomson, 1973; Brown et al. , 1986; Richardson-Klavehn and Bjork, 1988) . The relative sparing of P. S. s knowledge of people and the events with which they are associated might arise because of the highly specific search and retrieval processes that are triggered by individual names. These operations may not depend as closely on the thematic framework level of programming discussed above. Person-names can address highly specific semantic (context-free) information that can be employed to index knowledge about events and episodes associated with that name. We would suggest that the distinction between people and events arises as a consequence of the differing uniqueness of cues provided by these two types of information. Highly specific or unique cues provide a means of entering the memory system at a level below that of thematic retrieval frameworks. P. S. can also access information about the relative recency of individuals provided that judgement is relative rather than an absolute. So P. S. can judge that X is more recent than Y, who is more contemporary than Z (whether tested by faces or by names) ; but if P. S. is asked When was X famous? he defaults to his navy framework and transposes all individuals to the 1940s. These findings underline the contention that knowledge about people may be indexed using multiple access routines. They also demonstrate that the information that P. S. accesses from people s names has relative recency as an emergent property rather than as a constituent of his stored knowledge. Taking these two pieces of information together, we can deduce that the derivation my order occurs at a level of coding that is subsequent to phonological and lexical storage an inference LZ0z sequiajdas 6} UO Jesn Ayeigiq pueneH Aq SL Lebhb/LZ6/P/91 L/elole/ulesq/woo'dnoolwapece//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AMNESIA 937 that is consistent with previous work on amnesia (McCarthy and Warrington, 1993) .

Edelstyn, S. J. Ellis', P. Jenkinson and A. Sawyer Department of Psychology, University of Keele, Keele and Department of Neurology, Royal Infirmary, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, UK Abstract This study reports a patient with a unilateral left thalamic lesion which was centred on the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus. Cognitive neuropsychological assessment revealed a severe impairment in verbal memory and symptoms of executive dysfunction, in the presence of relatively intact visual and facial recognition, working memory, praxis, language and IQ. Verbal and visual recognition memory were investigated using the remember-know paradigm. The results indicated a profound impairment in recollection-driven verbal recognition memory. These results are discussed in the context of the role of the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus in recognition memory, and functional models of memory. Introduction Memory impairment is a well-documented sequela of thal- amic damage. Traditionally, diencephalic amnesia has been characterized by deficits in encoding and recollection (both free recall and recognition) , resulting in a severe anterograde episodic memory impairment in the presence of preserved 1Q, motor learning, perceptual functions and short-term memory (e. g. Von Cramon et al. , 1985; Weiskrantz, 1985; Graff-Radford et al. , 1990; Aggleton and Saunders, 1997; Squire and Zola, 1997) . However, most of the evidence linking thalamic pathology to memory deficits has been reported in patients with alcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff Syn- drome (e. g. Victor ef al. , 1989) . dependent on the extended hippocampal system, and that a second non-hippocampal system, which extended from the perirhinal cortex to the dorsomedial thalamic (DMT) nucleus and the prefrontal lobes, subserved the ability to evaluate the contextual memory strength, or familiarity, of an item. However, a number of authors have claimed that Aggleton and Brown s anatomical model is incompatible with empirical evidence reported from behavioural studies of rats (Mair et al. , 1999) and monkeys (Parker, 1999) as well as patients (Mayes et al. , 1999; Van der Warf et al. , 1999; Witter and Van der Warf, 1999; Hanley et al. , 2001) . For instance, Witter and Van der Warf (1999) described a patient who displayed evidence of impaired familiarity-but intact recollection-driven recognition in the context of a thalamic lesion which spared the DMT. While not disputing the neuroanatomical separation of recall from familiarity, the authors claimed that it was Correspondence to: N. M. J.

From a different perspective, the case reported by Hanley et al. (2001) also questioned the validity of Aggleton and Brown s claims. Their patient, ROB, exhibited a severe deficit in free recall of verbal material following a lesion which damaged the fornix and the anterior thalamic nucleus. cognitive deficits such as inattention. Memory problems due to the latter rather than a disruption to memory processes per se are evident in terms of an impairment in the active recall from the memory store in the presence of spared recognition or aided retrieval (Van der Warf et al. , 2000) . The current study sought to examine the effects of DMT pathology on retrieval- and familiarity-driven recognition in a single case study. The specific aims of the study were, first, to characterize the patient s memory deficits in terms of familiarity- and retrieval-driven recognition using the remem- ber -know paradigm. Second, by manipulating the level of target familiarity within the recognition memory system, to determine whether the observed profile was more readily accounted for by the single or dual memory system signal detection models. Methods Subjects Patient. QX, a 55-year-old, right-handed male university lecturer, woke to find that he was talking rubbish and had 444 N. M. J. Edelstyn et al. slurred speech. He noted that his right arm felt heavy, but this returned to normal. For 2 days he was very confused. QX developed disinhibited behaviour, reduced motivation, memory problems and apraxia. For instance, he was unable to return to his hobby of bell ringing because he could not remember the complex sequences of actions involved. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a discrete lacuna infarction involving the DMT of the left thalamus, which extended superolaterally and involved the medial part of the ventrolateral nucleus (see Fig. 1) . There was an incidental minor area of ischaemia in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe (Fig. 1b) . The patient s initials have been changed to preserve anonymity and informed consent was obtained. Neuropsychological profile. A detailed neuropsychological profile is presented in Table 1. QX s current IQ [Revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R) ; Wechsler, 1981] was placed in the high average range. This score indicates a slight decline in general intellectual functioning from premorbid levels which placed him in the superior range [National Adult Reading Test (NART) ; Nelson, 1982]. There was a large discrepancy between his high score on the verbal IQ subtests which placed him in the superior range, and scoring on the performance IQ subtests, which fell within the low average range. QX was particularly poor on block design, object assembly and digit symbol. Successful completion of block design and object assembly requires orderliness and planning, and are notable in that they do not lend themselves to verbalization (Lezak, 1995) . Digit symbol is a non-specific indicator of brain dysfunction, in that it involves the integration of many different components, which include visuomotor processing, visual search and shifting (Lezak, 1995) . QX displayed little difficulty in successfully completing the facial and visual processing tasks. He was able (1) to sort a pack of 50 famous faces drawn from a variety of different professions (including sport, politics, royalty, film and television) from 50 unfamiliar faces and then (2) to name the famous faces. Similarly, he had no problems naming 32 animate (16 animals and 16 fruit and vegetables) and 32 inanimate (drawn from a variety of categories including work tools, kitchen implements, vehicles, etc) line drawings. He was able to mime the use (i. e. and to identify another obj associated (association: e. g. function) of inanimate objects ject with which it would be a target item cup would be associated with a saucer ) . While for the animate exemplars he was able to label their superordinate category (e. g. for apple it would be fruit , or for dog it would be animal ) . Formal tests of language function [Psycholinguistic Assess- ments of Language Processing in Aphasia (PALPA) ; Kay et al. , 1992] failed to elicit the word-finding difficulties reported during casual conversation. Similarly, there was no evidence of buccofacial, ideomotor or constructional apraxia. Despite the reported personality and motivational changes, no deficits were evident on the tasks which tap executive Fig. 1.

Assessment of memory revealed a complex pattern of preserved and deficient abilities [Autobiographical Memory Inventory (AMI) , Kopelman ef al. , 1990; Rey Complex Figure, Myers and Myers, 1995; Wechsler Memory Scales (WMS) , Wechsler, 1997]. Working memory (WAIS-R, WMS) and autobiographical memory (AMI) for childhood and early adult life were intact. However, more recent memories for incidents and personal semantic information showed signs of impairment. Assessment of immediate and delayed visual and auditory memory (Rey Complex Figure, WMS) showed differential rates of impairment. Whereas auditory memory was impaired on all assessments, delayed visual memory appeared intact on the WMS but deficient on the Rey Complex Figure. This discrepancy may be accounted for in terms of task demands: whereas the WMS delayed visual memory subtest does not involve a visuomotor/visuoconstruc- tive component, the Rey Complex Figure does (refer to previous outline of WAIS-R performance IQ subtests) . Controls. The performance of two groups of normal controls are reported: a larger cohort of 29 young psychology undergraduate and A level student volunteers (NC[y]) aged between 16 and 29 years (mean 19. 5 years) and a smaller group (NC[o]) of five older age-matched (range 41-49 years, mean 45. 6 years) university employees. a distracter was termed a false alarm. Following each positive identification, irrespective of whether it was a target hit or a false alarm, the subjects had to decide the basis of their decision in terms of whether the item elicited (a) feelings of familiarity (i. e. a know response) or (b) a specific retrieval of the item having been presented QXx in the study phase (i. e. a remember judgement) . A third category, (c) guess, which was based on a superordinate category decision, was included during a pilot study but dropped for the reported tasks because the subjects failed to make use of it. The selection of remember know choices was not time constrained and was achieved using the hand- held buttons. Results Experiment 1. Short duration (3000 ms) recognition memory tasks Hit rates, defined as the conditional probability of responding yes to an old item, and false alarm rates, defined as the conditional probability of responding yes to a new item, were calculated [number of hits (or false alarms) + 0. 5/number of targets (or distracters) + 1] for both recognition memory tasks and are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 2. In this and subsequent analyses, QX s performance was considered to be significantly impaired if his score was 2. 0 standard deviations or more away from either of the two normal control group means.

QX dis- played evidence of both VRM and FRM impairment, which was apparent in terms of a significantly elevated false alarm rate for words and a reduced hit rate for faces. A breakdown of hit rate in terms of remember know judgements for the VRM and FRM tasks is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Both normal control groups recorded higher numbers of remember responses relative to know responses. QX, however, displayed significant impairment in terms of his paucity of remember judgements, which were compensated for by a significantly elevated number of know responses. The number of remember judgements was also significantly reduced in the FRM task when his performance was compared with the NC[o] group only. Subsequent analyses converted hit rates and false alarm rates into the non-parametric signal detection indices of A (Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988) and B p (Donaldson, 1992) which provided measures of discrimination accuracy and response bias, respectively (see Table 2) . B p values of 0 indicate a neutral response bias, i. e. when in an uncertain state a yes or no response is registered with equal probability, whereas positive (B\"p> = 0. 1-l) and __ negative (B\"p = 0. 1 to 1) values indicate conservative and liberal bias, respectively. A conservative bias is defined by the increased probability of no responses when in an uncertain state and a liberal bias is defined by the increased probability of yes judgements. QxX s discrimination accuracy on the VRM task was significantly impaired relative to both normal control groups normal ranges, and on the FRM task compared with the NC[o] set. Both normal control sets varied in terms of their response bias. Whereas the NC[o] group tended to exhibit a slightly liberal response bias on both recognition memory tasks, the NC[y] group displayed a more conservative one. QX also exhibited a conservative bias, which fell outside the NC[o] normal range for the FRM task only. Experiment 2. Long duration (6000 ms) recognition memory tasks Extending target exposure during the study phase facilitated VRM for the NC[y] group; this was evident in an increased hit rate and a reduced false alarm rate (see Table 2, Fig. 4) . The NC[o] group showed little change from their already high level of performance on the shorter target exposure version. QX s WRM, however, remained significantly impaired. Both his hit rate and his false alarm rate fell outside the normal range of both control groups. In contrast, a strong facilitatory effect was evident during the facial version, with both his hit rate and his false alarm rate falling well within the normal range of both control groups.

Remember and know judgements in experiment 2. The number of remember judgements recorded during the VRM task remained significantly impaired relative to the normal ranges of both control groups. The paucity of remem- ber judgements was again compensated for by a significantly elevated number of know responses, which fell outside the NC[y] normal range only. In contrast, a large increase in recorded remember judgements was evident in the FRM task, such that the numbers of recorded remember and know responses fell within the normal range of both normal control groups. QX s discrimination accuracy during the VRM_ task remained significantly impaired relative to both normal con- trol groups. However, a slight improvement was noted in the longer compared with the shorter exposure duration VRM task. This is attributed to the decrease in his false alarm rate. A dramatic improvement in discrimination accuracy was evident in the FRM version. This result is underpinned by an increased hit rate and a reduced false alarm rate. Finally, a slight change in response bias was noted. Both sets of normal controls displayed a conservative response bias on the VRM task and a liberal one on the FRM task. QX followed this trend. However, his stringently conservative response evident on the VRM task fell outside the NC[o] normal range. Measures of discrimination accuracy and response bias are presented in Table 2.

Verfaellie and Treadwell, 1993; Kroll et al. , 1996) . The paucity of QX s recollection judge- ments was most evident on the two VRM tasks, where the absence of a demonstrable remember response rate was compensated for by an increased know response rate. The performance profiles on the FRM tasks were more variable. The shorter exposure version was characterized by a low remember rate but no evidence of a compensatory increase in know rate, whereas the longer exposure version was marked by a significant increase in remember judgements to the extent that they were more numerous than know responses. The significant increase in the contribution of remember judgements to FRM on the longer exposure version suggests that recollection- and familiarity-driven recognition memory can be independently manipulated. However, it remains uncertain whether the nature of the dissociation between remember and know judgements on the VRM tasks reflects qualitatively distinct memory processes (Yonelinas, 1994; Yonelinas et al. , 1996; Dobbins et al. , 2000) or a memory system based on trace strength (Donaldson, 1996) . Currently in the literature there is an ongoing debate as to 450 N. M. J. Edelstyn et al. whether the raw number of know responses is an accurate measure of familiarity (Gardiner et al. , 1996; Richardson- Klavehn et al. , 1996) or not (Jacoby, 1991; Yonelinas and Jacoby, 1996; Khoe et al. , 2000) . Yonelinas and Jacoby (1996) claim that the number of recorded know responses is mathematically constrained by the proportion of remember judgements in the remember know procedure. They argue that the contribution of familiarity to recognition memory performance should be calculated from the proportion of know responses, given that the subjects are allowed to make such a response [i. e. familiarity = know/ (1 remember) ]. This is an important debate, but has little impact on QX s VRM performance given his near complete reliance on know responses. There are also questions regarding the extent to which the recollective component of recognition memory, as measured by remember judgements, maps on to the contextual recollec- tion processes operating during free recall of verbal material (Hanley et al. , 2001) . Hanley et al. reported a patient who exhibited a severe impairment of free recall of verbal material in the presence of intact use of remember and know judge- ments of tests of recognition memory. Drawing on the neural network model of the hippocampus proposed by Hasselmo and Wyble (1997) , the authors suggested that during free recall, context is used as a cue to retrieve an associated item, whereas during recollective-driven recognition the item is used as a cue to retrieve context. This case raises important questions as to whether important differences exist between the contextual-recollection processes used during free recall and recollective-driven recognition, which in turn has implica- tions for Aggleton and Brown s (1999) proposals regarding a common extended hippocampal system subserving free recall as well as retrieval-driven recognition. QX displayed clear evidence of contextual retrieval on verbal tests of both free recall as well as recollection-driven recognition. According to Hanley ef al. s interpretation of Hasselmo and Wyble s neural network model, this implies disruption of both context- as well as item-cue retrieval. However, perform- ance on the tests of visual memory was more variable, with clear deficiencies evident on immediate and delayed retrieval of the Rey Complex Figure and the recollection-driven FRM (short exposure duration) , yet spared delayed visual memory (WMS) and recollection-driven FRM (long exposure dura- tion) . His ability to use recollection-driven recognition in both FRM tasks, albeit to a lesser extent in the short duration version, suggests that QX does experience conscious recollective memory of the context in which target faces were presented at encoding. And unlike VRM, his FRM decisions are based on contextual retrieval and do not rely disproportionately on familiarity-driven recognition. The fact that QX s lesion is restricted to the left DMT suggests that this recollection-driven recognition for visual material is being supported by his right episodic memory system. Evidence regarding the neuroanatomical regions and path- ways implicated in familiarity- and recollection-driven recog- nition memory remains equivocal. In their anatomical model, Aggleton and Brown (1999) proposed that processes involved in familiarity-driven recognition memory depend on a DMT perirhinal prefrontal network whereas recollection-driven recognition memory is supported by a hippocampal di- encephalic system. Thus, damage restricted to the DMT should result in a selective deficit of familiarity not recollec- tion. However, in the reported case, extensive left DMT damage was associated with deficient recollection- not famili- arity-driven recognition memory. Van der Warf et al. (1999) also questioned DMT involvement in familiarity-driven recognition memory. Their patient exhibited evidence of impaired familiarity but spared recollection in the context of a thalamic lesion that spared the DMT, anterior thalamic nucleus and the mamillothalamic tract but involved the region of the right lateral internal medullary lamina (IML) . The authors concluded that the IML and/or nuclei within, rather than the DMT, is involved in familiarity-driven recognition memory. In addition to the reported verbal memory problems, QX also displayed evidence of a mild impairment of processes ascribed to the prefrontal cortex. For instance, QX s behaviour had become increasingly apathetic and disinhibited, and he performed poorly on tasks which required high levels of orderliness and planning (WAIS-R performance subtests) . Surprisingly, however, high levels of preservation were evid- ent on traditional tests of executive processing (WCST and Stroop) . In addition, there were also signs of executive memory dysfunction on the recognition memory tasks. This was evident in QX s extremely high false alarm rates on both VRM tasks, and to a lesser extent, his abnormal response bias exhibited on the short duration FRM and long duration VRM tasks. It has been claimed that the precise pattern of prefrontal deficits depends on the focus of damage within the thalamus, as specific thalamic nuclei have reciprocal projections with different parts of the prefrontal cortex. Thus, QX s behavi- oural symptoms are suggestive of dysfunction in the medial- orbital prefrontal cortex (Duffy and Campbell, 1994) ; while the presence of mild executive dysfunction suggests increased levels of preserved dorsolateral prefrontal processing (Fuster, 1989) . The presence of behavioural and cognitive evidence of prefrontal dysfunction following DMT damage is broadly consistent with Van der Warf et al. s review of the neuropsych- ology of thalamic infarction, in which the authors tentatively concluded that destruction of the midline nuclei (IML or the DMT) may lead to executive dysfunction. Interestingly, the authors go on to suggest that lesions of only one of these nuclei may be insufficient to produce a pronounced dysexecutive syndrome, which may account for the mild prefrontal signs and symptoms reported for QX. Taken together, these findings suggest that QX s verbal memory problems may be linked to recollection-based prob- lems, which have their origins in impaired retrieval that involves using context as well editors.

Edelst: A. Sawyer Abstract This study reports a patient with a unilateral left thalamic lesion which was centred on the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus. Cognitive neuropsychological assessment revealed a severe impairment in verbal memory and symptoms of executive dysfunction, in the presence of relatively intact visual and facial recognition, working memory, praxis, language and IQ. Verbal and visual recognition memory were investigated using the remember-know paradigm. The results indicated a profound impairment in recollection-driven verbal recognition memory. These results are discussed in the context of the role of the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus in recognition memory, and functional models of memory. , 9. J. Ellis, P.

        "other": "Many of these patients had large lesions, which extended well beyond individual thalamic nuclei, and often included the frontal lobes (Jacobson, 1989) . The lack of circumscribed neuropathology coupled with evidence of widespread neuronal damage, which results from prolonged exposure to alcohol (Okazaki, 1989) , have obscured which thalamic structures are critical for the devel- opment of diencephalic amnesia (Graff-Radford et al. , 1990; Mennemeier et al. , 1992) . More recently, an attempt has been made to reformulate the anatomy underlying anterograde amnesia and in so doing it has been claimed that the distinction between temporal lobe and diencephalic amnesia is of limited value (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . The main argument for this is based on the premise that diencephalic and medial temporal lobe anterograde amnesia arise from damage to a common extended hippocampal memory system, which is comprised of reciprocal connections between the hippocampus, the mamillary bodies and the anterior thalamic nucleus, via the fornix (Aggleton and Shaw, 1996; Aggleton and Saunders, 1997; Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Aggleton and Brown proposed that this extended hippocampal diencephalic sys- tem was critical for the encoding and subsequent recall of contextual information about a previous episode. Further- more, they suggested that this memory system was not necessary for efficient recognition. This proposal builds on earlier suggestions that recognition memory arises out of two functionally independent components, i. e. contextual recollection and familiarity detection (Mandler, 1980; Jacoby and Dallas, 1981) . Aggleton and Brown claimed that contex- tual recollection was However, there was no evidence of impaired recol- lection-driven recognition memory. The authors acknow- ledged that damage to the extended hippocampal circuit had a major impact on recall relative to recognition, but their findings did not support the suggestion that the extended hippocampal system was necessary for recognition memory decisions which were based on contextual recollection. Recognition memory has also been investigated using signal detection models (Yonelinas, 1994; Donaldson, 1996) Typically, such studies make use of Tulving s (1985) remem- ber-know paradigm, which requires subjects not only to identify target stimuli from distracters during recognition testing, but also to select the basis of their decisions in terms of either explicit retrieval (i. e. remember) or feelings of familiarity (i. e. know) . Remember know studies have led to a number of dissociations between retrieval and familiarity responses being identified. For instance, word frequency and levels of processing have been shown to influence selectively remember judgements (e. g. Gardiner and Java, 1990; Rajaram, 1993) ; whereas conceptual fluency only affects know responses (Rajaram and Geraci, 2000) . Reports of amnesic patients with widespread damage of the medial temporal lobe using the remember know paradigm have yielded inconsistent results. Studies by Verfaellie and Treadwell (1993) , Kroll et al. (1996) and Schacter et al. (1996) found that amnesics were more likely to use know responses, based on feelings of familiarity, than remember judgements. Whereas a later report by Knowlton and Squire (1995) claimed that amnesics were less likely to make know responses and concluded that familiarity responses were disrupted. Both Donaldson s and Yonelinas signal detection models allow for a dissociation between the two component processes of recognition. However, they differ in terms of their theoret- ical predictions. Donaldson proposes that a single underlying memory system based on a continuum of familiarity, sub- serves both know and remember judgements. It assumes that subjects cannot directly determine whether an item is familiar or not; rather individuals are only aware of an item s level of familiarity. Therefore, in order to label an item familiar or unfamiliar, a criterion value of familiarity must be set, such that items which exceed it are labelled familiar and those which do not are labelled as unfamiliar. A second more stringent criterion value of familiarity is used to determine whether a target item accesses stored recollective information or not. Items whose level of familiarity is sufficiently strong to exceed this second criterion result in the retrieval of contextualizing information and are labelled remember, while those which fail to do so are labelled know. In contrast, Contribution of the left DMT to recognition memory 443 Yonelinas suggested that familiarity and retrieval are best accounted for by a dual-process model, in which know responses are familiarity driven, whereas remember judge- ments are dependent on a separate non-familiarity-based mechanism operating in parallel (Yonelinas et al. , 1996; Dobbins et al. , 2000) . Lesions of the thalamus not only give rise to memory disorders, but can also lead to a disruption of prefrontal processes [see review by Van der Warf et al. (2000) ]. Extensive reciprocal projections exist between the DMT and ipsilateral medial and orbital regions of the prefrontal cortex (Bachevalier and Mishkin, 1986; see also Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Thus, a lesion centred on the DMT is likely to cause widespread dysfunction within prefrontal areas, leading to disturbances of executive abilities, attention, initi- ation, inhibition and temporal organization of behaviour [see review by Van der Warf et al. (2000) ]. It is known from studies of animals and patients that frontal/temporal interaction is essential for the encoding of novel items (Parker et al. , 1988) and in key executive memory functions involved in strategic memory search, monitoring and decision making (Shallice, 1980; Squire, 1981; Kapur et al. , 1995; Markowitsch, 1995; Parker and Gaffan, 1997, 1998; Parker et al. , 1997; Rapcsak et al. , 1999; Ward et al. , 1999) . For instance, in normal subjects, when exposed to an unfamiliar face which elicits false feelings of familiarity because of certain physical similarities to known faces, this uncertainty may be resolved by attempts to retrieve more detailed contextual information. Patients with damage to their prefrontal lobes may not spontaneously engage in this effortful search, and therefore produce high levels of false recognition, which is evident in an elevated false alarm rate (Rapcsak et al. , 1999) . Thus, memory problems may arise either as a direct consequence of prefrontal damage, or secondarily as a result of prefrontal All subjects were right-handed, had English as their first language, had normal/ corrected visual acuity and no reported dyslexia, neurological or psychiatric history. Anterograde memory experiments Procedure. Recognition memory for words and faces was assessed separately, using the same procedure. A standard recognition memory format was used, which consisted of a study phase, during which time the target stimuli were presented, and a recognition phase, when target stimuli were discriminated from novel distracters. A total of four recognition memory tasks were adminis- tered: two facial recognition memory (FRM) tasks and two verbal recognition memory (VRM) tasks. Both FRM tasks and VRM tasks were matched in all respects apart from the duration of target exposure during the study phase. In one version, the facial and verbal targets were exposed for 3000 ms and in the other version it was 6000 ms. Visual stimuli were presented in a program written in Microsoft Visual C+ + using MFC on a personal computer running Windows 95. The images presented in the FRM tasks consisted of 100 black and white photographs of unfamiliar male faces (images extended 8 cm horizontally and 9 cm vertically, and viewed at a visual angle of 9 ) . The words used in the VRM tasks were a mixture of 50 high- and low-frequency unfamiliar adjectives (mean 137, range 2-2035) . All stimuli were viewed one at a time in the centre of the screen. 446 N.

Hit and false alarm rates in experiment 1. Fifty target items were presented during the study phase. To help concentration, the subjects were instructed to state whether the item (face or word) was pleasant or not. During the recognition phase, which immediately followed comple- tion of the study phase, the studied targets were mixed with 50 unfamiliar distracters. The subject s task was to identify the target items from the distracters. This process was achieved by pressing one of two hand-held buttons: pressing the button held in the right hand indicated a yes response for a positive recognition (i. e. an old item) while pressing the left-hand button indicated a no response to an unrecog- nized item (i. e. a new item) . The subjects had a 3000 ms window in which to register their choice before the next stimulus item appeared. The participants were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. The subjects were familiarized with the experimental set-up using a practice test prior to starting the experimental tasks. The presentation order of the recogni- tion memory tasks (verbal versus facial; 3000 versus 6000 ms) was counterbalanced across subjects. Correct identification of an old item was defined as a hit, while false recognition of the normal range of one group but not the other.

Furthermore, when con- sidering Aggleton and Brown s neuroanatomical model, their prediction of impaired familiarity-driven recognition memory following DMT damage is not supported. In sum, rather than advocating a key role for the DMT in familiarity, it may be that the DMT acts in an integrative role with respect to the prefrontal cortex (Parker, 1999) .

M. P. SMITH, D. L. MCLELLAN? and E. H. BURROWS! (From the Wessex Neurological Centre, the *Neuropathology Department and the >Rehabilitation Department, Southampton General Hospital, UK) SUMMARY A patient who suffered a severe closed head injury was left with a dense retrograde amnesia for events which she had experienced prior to her injury, but she showed only mild, patchy anterograde memory impairment. Her retrograde amnesia included both public events and autobiographical material, and it extended back to her childhood. Previously learned skills such as playing a piano and driving a car were spared, even though she had no recollection at all of the original learning experience. A series of focused magnetic resonance scan images revealed major pathology in the anterior portion of both temporal lobes. No significant abnormality was found in the hippocampus, thalamus or other medial structures in the limbic-diencephalic system. Our findings indicate the independence of anterograde and retrograde memory mechanisms, and point to structures and pathways in the anterior temporal lobes as playing a critical role in memory for past events. INTRODUCTION In many memory disordered patients, major anterograde memory loss is accompanied by marked retrograde memory deficits (Kapur, 1988) . However, a number of patients may present with minimal retrograde memory deficits or retrograde deficits which are disproportionately small compared with their anterograde memory impairment (e. g. Zola-Morgan et al. , 1986) . Patients in whom retrograde amnesia occurs as a relatively isolated deficit, or disproportionately marked compared with any anterograde memory loss, form a relatively unique set of patients. A few such neurological patients have been reported in recent years (Roman-Campos et al. , 1980; Goldberg et al. , 1981; Rousseaux et al. , 1984; Kapur et al. , 1989) . We were able to examine a head injury patient who was similar in a number of ways to the cases described by Goldberg er al. (1981) and by Rousseaux er al. (1984) . We therefore sought to carry out the following investigations: (1) to administer a wide range of anterograde and retrograde memory tests to see if a similar selectivity of retrograde memory loss was present, (2) to ascertain the extent, severity and sparing of retrograde memory functioning; (3) to obtain precise neuroradiological information, based on magnetic resonance imaging, relating to the possible anatomical basis of focal retrograde amnesia.

KAPUR AND OTHERS such as those who have suffered herpes simplex encephalitis (Damasio et al. , 1985) , are limited by the coexistence of diverse loci of lesions. On the basis of CT scan data from their head injury patient, Goldberg er al. (1981) suggested that a lesion in the ventral tegmental region of the mesencephalon may underlie focal retrograde amnesia. However, there has been no subsequent evidence to confirm or refute this hypothesis, or to suggest other candidate anatomical structures which may underlie dense retrograde amnesia. Furthermore, since the publication by Goldberg ef al. (1981) , magnetic resonance imaging technology has become widely available, offering greater anatomical precision than computerized axial tomography. CASE REPORT Clinical history L. T. , a right-handed woman (date of birth November 2, 1962) who had previously worked as a nanny, suffered a severe closed head injury in November 1988 as a result of falling off a horse. A skull X-ray indicated a left occipital fracture. A CT scan at the time of hospital admission was reported as follows: Both cerebral hemispheres are smeared with fresh subarachnoid blood. Haemorrhagic contusion of the right frontal lobe is present, possibly also of the left frontal lobe. The quadrigeminal cistern is poorly outlined and appears to be compressed, but the third ventricle remains visible. After several days ventilation, L. T. was weaned off this support and was gradually improving until she became pyrexial on December 5 with a deterioration in her level of consciousness. A repeat CT scan showed no evidence of an intracranial abscess, and on this occasion the scan was reported as showing patchy low attenuation in the white matter of both frontal lobes, more so in the right than the left, with possible involvement of the right temporal pole. The ventricles had now returned to a more normal appearance. Her past medical history contained no events of note. She left school at the age of 16 yrs, with six O-level passes, and then completed a 2-yr course to become a qualified nanny. Detailed neurological and neuropsychological investigations were carried out between April and June 1990. Physical examination She was alert, attentive, cooperative and appropriate in her behaviour during the examination. She walked on a slightly widened base with a mildly irregular cadence but was able to walk heel to toe and could hop on either leg. No sense of smell could be detected. Her visual acuity was 6/6 bilaterally (corrected) and the optic fundi were normal. There was a mild divergent strabismus which was constant in all directions of gaze and associated with diplopia. Some convergence occurred but this could be maintained for close objects only with difficulty. With an ophthalmoscope, a slight vertical nystagmus could be detected especially in the right eye where the vertical phase was downwards. The pupils were of normal size, equal in circumference and reacted briskly to light and accommodation. There was a very slight right ptosis. Her corneal reflexes were both present. There was a slight weakness of the left side of the face which included the orbicularis oculi as well as the muscles of the lower part of the face. There was mild impairment of hearing in the left ear associated with an old perforation of the drum. Sensation on the face, mouth and palate were normal and voluntary movements of the palate also appeared normal, but no gag reflex could be obtained and stimulation of the back of the pharynx did not induce a sense of discomfort. The upper limbs were held outstretched to command a normal posture. Fine movements of the right hand were normal, but rapid and discriminatory movements of the digits of the left hand were moderately impaired. Tendon reflexes were pathologically brisk in both upper limbs but there was no increase in muscle tone. There was mild weakness of all muscle groups in the left upper limb reducing power by approximately 15% compared with the right side. In the lower limbs there was an equivalent reduction in power in all muscle groups. Muscle tone was normal. Plantar responses and abdominal reflexes were all normal. Tendon reflexes were pathologically brisk, with unsustained clonus at the knees and at the right ankle and sustained clonus at the left ankle. Rapid voluntarily alternating movements of the foot were impaired on the left side. There was no abnormality of sensation either in the upper or lower limbs. These findings provided limited clinical evidence for a brain stem lesion impairing conjugate gaze and LZ0Z JOQUISAON g} UO Jasn Areuqi7 jooydS meq PeNeH Aq LOSS6Z/EZ/L/S1 L/ajolue/uresq/woo'dno siwepese//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq FOCAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA 75 possibly contributing to impaired motor control in the limbs, although some of the impairment on the left side is likely to have been due to impairment within the left hippocampal formation, and these were equally prominent in L. T. as in the control subject. The only other abnormalities of note in L. T. s HR scan were mild ventricular dilatation and high T, W signals from the infero-medial portion of both frontal poles. General cognitive functioning Before her detailed assessment at the Wessex Neurological Centre between April and June 1990, L. T. had been seen by a clinical psychologist for a brief assessment 2 3 mths after her head injury. He reported that she had mild anterograde memory impairment and mild visuoperceptual impairment, together with considerable behavioural changes which included euphoria, distractibility and some disinhibition. On the basis of nine subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Revised) (Wechsler, 1981) given in March 1990, L. T. had a verbal IQ of 92, a performance IQ of 108 and a full-scale 1Q of 98. Individual subtest scores are shown in Table 1. On the National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) , her reading score was equivalent to an estimated 1Q of 105. As can be seen, most subtest scores were within the normal range, but her scores on the ee and to a lesser extent the Vocabulary subtest, do probably represent a significant impairment. The Information subtest includes items which cover remote memory and general knowledge, and this contributed to her low score on this task. On the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Nelson, 1976) , she obtained a perfect score. On the verbal fluency subtest of the Minnesota Multiphasic Aphasia Examination (Benton and Hamsher, 1978) , she did not show any impairment. Her naming of a set of line drawings (McKenna and Warrington, 1983) was mildly impaired (13/30 items correctly named) , though there was no evidence at all of any dysphasia in her conversational speech. She performed well on a faces nton et al. , 1975) . Anterograde memory assessment L. T. did not complain of any significant everyday memory difficulties, and her fianc also thought her everyday memory was normal, these observations being borne out by formal scores on a memory symptoms test sensitive to memory difficulties after blunt head injury (Kapur and Pearson, 1983) . L. T. s anterograde memory functioning was assessed over a range of tests. Her performance on the Revised Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1987) is outlined in Table 2. As can be seen, her (92 and 104, respectively) . On closer scrutiny of individual subtests, the only memory subtest on which she had an: difficulty of note was the story recall task; this was probably due in part to her mild naming difficulty.

It is worth noting that on delayed recall she was in fact able to remember most items which she retrieved on immediate recall. On a word and a face recognition memory test (Warrington, 1984) , she obtained a perfect score (50/50) for word recognition, but did show a moderate impairment (37/50: age-scaled score of 5) on the faces recognition memory task. Retrograde memory assessment: autobiographical memory L. T. s autobiographical memory for events prior to the head injury was assessed by means of a struc- tured interview covering past personal events, and used similar procedures to those described elsewhere LZ0Z JOQUISAON g} UO Jasn AyeIgI |OoyDS meq pPleneH Aq LO8S6Z/EZ/1/S | L/elolWe/ulesq/W0o' dno olwepese//: sdyy Woy pepeojumoq FOCAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA 77 TABLE |.

The particular items selected for this interview were based on an initial interview with L. T. s fianc , and covered the following areas: holidays, hospital treatments, occupational history, houses in which she had lived, cars which she had owned, educational experience, births and deaths in her family, and weddings she had attended. The interview schedule was given twice, once to cover the time period prior to her injury, and on a second occasion 5 wks later to cover post-injury events in the past year. Autobiographical memory is notoriously difficult to assess precisely and in a reliable and quantitative form in view of individual differences which undoubtedly occur between subjects. We have tried to take this into account in our interpretation of L. T. s responses. L. T. had marked loss of memory for information and events relating to the period prior to her injury, and (unusual for patients with neurological disease) both L. T. and her family were also acutely aware of this disability and spontaneously offered this as the major residual disability which she now displayed. For example, although she had known her fianc for almost 9 yrs she had no memories of their time together and could not recount when she first met him. Her personal semantic memory (covering tasks such as LZOZ JOQUISAON | UO Jasn Areuqi7 jooyoS Me PUeNeH Aq LOSS6Z/EZ/L/S1 L/a}olue/ulesq/woo'dno siwepece//: sdyy wo. pepeojumoq 78 N. KAPUR AND OTHERS the ability to name schools attended, addresses where she had lived, etc. ) was markedly impaired, though generally less severely affected than her personal episodic memory for specific incidents and events which had taken place. In any instances where she could offer information, she was usually able to remember clearly that she had been told the information in question and when pressed she would consistently deny any spontaneous recollection of a past event. There was no firm evidence of any temporal gradient in her autobiographical memory loss. Examples of her autobiographical memory loss include the following. Holidays. While she knew that she went on several holidays prior to her accident, she indicated that this was on the basis of what she had recently been told by her family. She could not recall any incident during recent holidays. For example, she had no memory for horse-riding during a holiday in Scotland in September 1988, a few months prior to the accident. On one occasion, she apparently did go horse-riding all day and was unable to walk properly for the whole of the next day. She had no personal memories for holidays in Majorca or Ibiza where she went in the years prior to her injury, nor could she recall being in Rhodes on a holiday in the 1970s. She could recall no holiday in her childhood (she apparently went as a child to Austria and the South of France with her parents) . Hospital treatment. She could not remember two hospital admissions as a child, one for ear surgery and the other for a burn, though she indicated that she was now aware of the latter episode as her parents had told her about this since the head injury. Occupational history. She had worked as a nanny for the 8 yrs after leaving college. She was able to give the names of some parents for whom she had worked as a nanny, and of some of the children of whom she took care. However, her account of this pre-injury period was much less detailed than that which her fianc could offer, and she was unable to describe any incident which had occurred during this period. When she recently saw some of the children again and saw one of the day nurseries in which she had worked, she indicated that she had some feelings of familiarity and was aware that the children meant something to her, but could not retrieve any identity or contextual information nor could she recall any particular memories associated with them. It thus appeared that this form of exposure priming did not bring back specific episodic memories for past events. Houses. She was able to give an accurate list of the places in which she had lived in the years prior to her injury, but she again stated that this was on the basis of what she had been told. She had no memories for the places in which she had lived as a child or teenager. Cars. She has no memories for particular pre-injury incidents which had occurred (such as a car radio being stolen, an exhaust falling off the car, etc. ) in relation to the cars which she had driven. She has no memory of learning to drive a car. Educational experience. She can recall the names of the college and schools she attended on the basis of what she has been told. To specific questioning she could only recall the names of teachers which she had recently been told by her family. She could give the name of the headmistress and a class teacher in her secondary school, as these had been told to her, but she could not recall the names of any other teachers or of any teachers in primary school. She could not give the names of her best friends in her primary school. She could give the names of two friends from secondary school, but again she had been told these since the accident. Births. She has no memories for particular births of which she would have been aware during her time as a nanny, though she was able to give the name of her godson and of his mother. Deaths. She has no memory of the death of her fianc s father (which occurred 8 mths before the injury) , though is aware of this on account of being told about it. She also could not recollect the funeral of one of her grandmothers, which she attended and which occurred about 4 yrs before the injury. Weddings. She did not have any specific memories for three weddings which she attended in the 8 yrs prior to her injury. In summary, she had almost complete loss of memory for information and events relating to the period prior to her injury. It would seem that her personal semantic memory was less severely affected than LZ0Z JOQUISAON g} UO Jasn AyeIgI |ooy9S meq pPseMeH Aq L08S6Z/EZ/1/S | L/elolWe/ulesq/Woo\"dno siwepese//: sdyy Wo. pepeojumoq FOCAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA 79 her memory for specific incidents and events which had taken place. There was no firm evidence of any temporal gradient in her autobiographical memory loss. So marked was the retrograde amnesia which L. T. displayed that she was taken by her family to visit a number of the places associated with her autobiographical memory loss (in the hope that this might trigger her past memories) , for example houses in which she had lived. She indicated that this exposure priming did not bring back any significant memory related to the place in question. She did admit to some feeling of familiarity in respect of the place, but also indicated that since her family had shown her photographs of the places as well it was difficult for her to know how significant such feelings of familiarity were. Within her dense retrograde amnesia, there was some sparing of certain forms of memory and these closely paralleled observations of sparing in the more common anterograde amnesias. Thus, L. T. could still perform perceptual-motor skills which she had acquired prior to her injury. She could play the piano and read music, ard when asked to drive a car she was able to do this for a short distance without a need to be instructed in the component skills involved. However, she had no recollection at all of the original learning experiences, and, for example, could not recall her driving test. A further sparing in her retrograde amnesia is the observation by her and her fianc that when she has met individuals from her past such as children she once looked after, she has an emotional familiarity recognition of them, even though specific identity or contextual information did not come to hand. In a corresponding interview for post-injury events, it was much easier for her to provide information. Thus, she was able to describe holidays which she had taken during the past year (including incidents which occurred during such holidays) , her outpatient treatment, events relating to her house and car, and recent births in families whom she knew. In general, her memory for such events was as detailed as that provided by her fianc . A further_assessment of L. . T. s autobiographical memory was carried out using a cued recall technique in which the patient has to offer_a specific past memory in respect of a particular cue word. A similar wa at previor re (MacKinnon and Squire, 1989) . Ten words were presented . T. one at e (tree, nail, baby, ticket, bottle, flag, book, window, street, picture) . The test was carried out twice, with a 15 min gap between sessions and with the instructions to recall either pre-injury events or post-injury events. Responses were recorded verbatim. L. T. was given the following instructions: I will say a word to you, and I'd like you to try to recall an event from before/after your head injury that could be associated with the word. You can select an episode from any time before/after your injury, but try to choose one that you can remember as having happened at a particular time and in a particular place. In both sessions, L. T. was encouraged by probes to offer specific time/place information in respect of a particular event. L. T. s responses were rated by a clinical neuropsychologist who was blind to the case, and who was told that the set of responses could have come from a neurological or a control patient. A rating of O 3 was given according to the amount of detail (3 = maximum amount of detail) which was provided by L. T. in her verbal report. Note the dramatic difference between the two sets of test scores, even though the pre-injury period covers most of her life, whereas the post-injury period only covers around 20 mths. L. T. s performance for pre-injury and post-injury events is indicated in Fig. 2, which shows zero recall for pre-injury memories and a much higher score for post-injury memories.

KAPUR AND OTHERS Retrograde memory assessment: memory for public events L. T. was tested on a range of remote memory tests: (1) identification of famous scenes (Kopelman, 1989) ; (2) the dead/alive test (Kapur et al. , 1989) which assesses memory for personalities who had been famous over the past 30 yrs; (3) a test of memory for famous faces (Montaldi and Parkin, 189) ; (4) a test of memory for famous names. Identification of famous scenes. The famous scenes test assessed recall and recognition for news events which took place over the past 50 yrs but only post-1975 items were considered in view of L. T. \"s age. Items were presented on slides, with no specific time-limit for a response. L. T. s performance and that of four control subjects on the recall and recognition parts of post-1975 test items is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, L. T. was markedly impaired on the recall portion, with a milder impairment on recognition testing. There was no evidence of any temporal gradient in her memory performance. Dead/alive test. The dead/alive memory test assessed L. T. s ability to indicate whether a famous personality from the past was dead or alive, whether he/she had been killed or had died of natural causes, and an indication of the time period (in 5-yr bands) when he/she died. Forty items made up the test: 30 related to famous personalities who had died, and the remaining 10 referred to people who were still living. L. T. and a group of four matched control subjects were tested. Items were scored such that for the alive items, subjects obtained a score of two or zero. If they correctly indicated that a personality had died, they were given two points. A further two points were awarded if they could indicate the nature of the death (killed/natural causes) , and an additional two points were allocated if the time period of the death was within one band-width of the time of death. For example, if the person had died in 1963, the subject would obtain two points if she indicated the bandwidths 1955 1959, 1960 1964 or 1965 1969. Figure 4 shows L. T. s performance and that of control subjects for dead and for alive items. As can be seen, L. T. showed markedly impaired performance for items from all the decades, and her deficit extended both to personalities who were dead and those who were alive.

L. T. was also given a retrograde amnesia test (Montaldi and Parkin, 1989) in which famous faces from earlier decades (1936 1985) had to be identified. Five decades were sampled: 1936-1945, 1946-1955, 1956-1965, 1966 1975, 1976 1985, with six items per decade. Two conditions were tested, one where the individuals were shown out of context and the other where the individuals were shown ina context which closely related to their occupation (e. g. a famous tennis player in an evening dress or in action wearing tennis gear) . L. T. s performance on this test, together with that of a group of four matched control subjects is shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, L. T. performed poorly on the test. She showed little if any improvement in the context compared with the no context condition. Memory for famous names. L. T. was shown a set of 48 names, 23 of which had been famous over the past 15 yrs. In most instances, these were names which had been famous for a short period (e. g. Bobby Sands) and had then faded out of the news. L. T. was asked to indicate whether the name was that of someone who had been in the news, and if so to indicate what they had been famous for. As can be seen from Fig. 6, L. T. s score on this test was much lower than that of control subjects. She was only LT's Performance on Famous Faces Test 100 5 @ 80 8 eo Fic. 5. L. T.

DISCUSSION Our patient, L. T. , who suffered a severe closed head injury, was left with a dense retrograde amnesia, but she showed only limited anterograde memory loss. Her retrograde LZ0Z JOQUISAON g} UO Jasn AyeIgI |ooy9S meq pPseMeH Aq L08S6Z/EZ/1/S | L/elolWe/ulesq/Woo\"dno siwepese//: sdyy Wo. pepeojumoq 82 N. KAPUR AND OTHERS amnesia included both public events and autobiographical material, and her memory loss for personal past events extended back to her childhood. Magnetic resonance scanning revealed focal pathology in the anterior portion of both temporal lobes, with predominantly lateral rather than medial temporal lobe involvement. Some additional, much more limited pathology was present in the medial undersurface of both frontal poles. Our findings highlight the independence of anterograde and retrograde memory mechanisms, and substantiate evidence from patients with global amnesia (Squire ef al. , 1989) . At the level of ictal memory loss, our data also parallel observations made regarding the dissociations which occur between the presence of pre-traumatic and post-traumatic amnesia (Teuber, 1969; Russell, 1971) . The pattern of memory loss shown by L. T. was quite similar to that reported by Goldberg et al. (1981) , and the aetiology of our patient s pathology was the same. Although Goldberg et al. (1981) emphasized the mesencephalic lesion evident on their patient s CT scan, it is worth noting that their set of CT findings also included moderate ventricular enlargement, a region of rarefaction in the right middle and posterior temporal areas, and a small region of rarefaction along the left mid-temporal convexity (p. 1932) . Our patient s MR scan showed mild ventricular dilatation, and major pathology in both anterior temporal lobes. We were unable to detect a mid-brain lesion of the type seen by Goldberg er al. (1981) and in view of the large number of axial, sagittal and coronal slices gathered in the various CT and MR examinations, it is unlikely that such a lesion could have been missed by our imaging procedures. The frontal lobe pathology which was present on L. T. s MR scan may have played a part in her remote memory loss, though this is unlikely in view of the limited extent of the lesion. While there is some evidence to implicate frontal lobe pathology in retrograde amnesia (Kopelman, 1989) , other data suggest that frontal lobe damage does not play a critical role in autobiographical memory loss (Dall Ora er al. , 1989) . We favour a hypothesis which puts primary weight on the bilateral temporal lobe lesions which were present. Such pathology is invariably present in patients with amnesia following herpes encephalitis, and is probably also present in some patients with an Alzheimer-type dementia. These patients usually suffer from hippocampal and related medial temporal lobe pathology, as well as damage both to other temporal lobe neocortical structures, and to other cortical regions, making it difficult to confirm or refute precise anatomical hypotheses from such patients alone. However, we broadly support the conclusions reached by Van Hoesen (1990) , who concluded on the basis of the locus of Alzheimer pathology that changes that affect the lateral temporal, posterior parahippocampal, temporopolar, and anterior insular cortices further exacerbate the problem and contribute to retrograde memory abnormalities in the episodic and contextual memory realms (p. 254) . Van Hoesen also highlighted the multi-modal nature of afferent connections to these structures from association cortices, and we would argue that many components of retrograde memory, in particular autobiographical knowledge, are invariably multi-modal in nature. Impaired performance on retrograde memory tasks has also been reported in patients with combined left-anterior medial and lateral temporal ablation (Barr et al. , 1990) , but this pattern of memory loss differed from that shown by L. T. in that her autobiographical memory loss was much more severe, and the degree of anterograde memory deficit was both less marked and less extensive.

In the case of L. T. , her delayed story recall, though below average, was in fact slightly better than her immediate recall, and her delayed recall of complex figures from the Wechsler Memory Scale was above average. It is quite possible that it is the bilateral nature of our patient s pathology which underlies her dense autobiographical memory loss, since sparing of this domain of memory functioning has been reported in patients with primarily unilateral left medial temporal pathology (De Renzi et al. , 1987) or left parietal pathology (Grossi et al. , 1988) , who otherwise also had extensive memory deficits for past public events. In our patient, the hippocampus was considered on close examination to be intact. Patients with focal hippocampal pathology have been found to have minimal retrograde amnesia (Zola-Morgan et al. , 1986) . The degree of retrograde amnesia in the patient H. M. has been variably reported to be from a few years (Marslen-Wilson and Teuber, 1975; Gabrieli et al. , 1988) to around 11 yrs (Corkin, 1984) . As Corkin (1984) has pointed out, the true extent of his retrograde amnesia is probably difficult to know with certainty in view of the length of time since the onset of his amnesia and the fact that his learning capacity was probably not perfect prior to his surgery because of his severe epilepsy and the high doses of anti-convulsant medication he had been receiving. Nevertheless, if one accepts that H. M. s retrograde amnesia is rather mild this can be explained, in the context of the findings from the present study, by the relative absence of lateral neocortical temporal lobe damage in the pattern of lesions which he sustained. H. M. s surgery entailed an excision which extended posteriorly from the midpoint of the medial top of the temporal lobes for a distance of roughly 8 cm. In this fashion, the prepyriform gyrus, uncus, amygdala, hippocampus, and hippocampal gyrus were resected bilaterally. The removal was limited superiorly and laterally by the temporal horns, and extended approximately 3 cm posterior to the medial portion of the petrous ridge (Scoville, 1968, pp. 211 212; see also Corkin, 1984 for CT confirmation of the extent of surgery) . Thus, the lateral portions of the anterior and mid regions of the temporal lobes were spared by this surgery, and we would hypothesize that these structures, which were specifically lesioned in our patient L. T. , may be the critical ones that determine the extent and severity of retrograde amnesia. Patients who have undergone ablation of both lateral and medial temporal lobe structures have seldom been reported, though in one such study (Terzian and Dalle Ore, 1955) there was clinical evidence in the early post-surgical period of a dense anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Where there is bilateral hippocampal damage, but sparing of the neocortex of one temporal lobe, as in Case | reported by Penfield and Mathieson (1974) , there is evidence for recovery of an initially marked retrograde amnesia together with persistence of anterograde memory loss. Cases where bilateral temporal lobe ablation completely spares medial temporal lobe regions are also rare, and have seldom been studied in detail, though in a short case report of one patient (Petit-Dutaillis et al. , 1954) there was clinical evidence for a residual degree of retrograde amnesia with substantial recovery of an initial anterograde amnesia. Since our case was one of blunt head injury, it remains possible that some additional focal or M. Seminars in Neurology, 4, 249-259.

Psychiatry and Brain Research (1997) 5: 71-78 Universititsverlag Ulm GmbH 1997 Neurology, Psychiatry ana Brain Research Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury leading to severe auto- biographical retrograde and moderate anterograde episodic amnesia - implications for the anatomy of memory H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald Physiological Psychology. University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany Summary Neuropsychological and neuroradiological data are re- ported for a 56 year old patient, DD, with traumatic brain injury. Prior to injury the patient had been a top specialist in his professional field and had obtained a doctor's degree. Hit by a bus, DD received major right sided damage to his frontal skull, resulting in loss of right eye vision, and ex- tensive right prefrontal and anterior temporal damage. In addition the anterior right basal ganglia and the inferior anterior left frontal lobe were damaged together with the genu of the corpus callosum. The patient was repeatedly tested neuropsychologically 2 to 3 years post-injury. He was depressed and manifested moderate anterograde and severe autobiographical retrograde amnesia. His anterograde memory problems seem to be a consequence of reduced cognitive flexibility and inefficient structuring and active self-organization abilities, caused by his prefrontal damage. His retrograde amnesia is interpreted as related to the com- bined temporo-frontal damage in the right hemisphere which has been shown to result in precisely this deficit pattern in other patients with the same pattern of brain damage. It is concluded that fronto-temporal brain damage, largely restricted to the right hemisphere, results in an inability to retrieve or ecphorize autobiographical old memories. Key words: prefrontal cortex -- temporal cortex amnesia - 7, -- hemispheric specialization -- head trauma -- ecphory Introduction Memory nowadays is divided along time-based and con- tent-based dimensions. Four principal long-term memory systems have been proposed [38, 39]: Episodic memory, consisting of context (time, locus) embedded information, the knowledge system, consisting of general facts, devoid of context, procedural memory, that is memory for skills, and priming, which refers to the fact that non-conscious pres- entation of a stimulus may lead to a higher probability of re-identification at a later time point. Episodic, or autobio- graphic memory is most vulnerable to brain damage, but also to psychologically-based memory disturbances. The time-dimension of memory has a long tradition: Short-term and long-term memory are the most commonly used subdivisions. However, especially in more recent times the division into old memories (established prior to brain damage) and new memories (established after brain damage) has gained increasing interest due to the appear- ance of cases with socalled focal retrograde amnesia (RA) [9, 11, 14, 15, 19]. There are a number of single case reports on patients with focal RA [1, 13, 17, 24, 25], a few group studies [30, 35] and dynamic imaging work with normals [5], psycho- genic [26, 28] and organic amnesics [29], but there are still open questions. Among them (a) the relationship between anterograde and retrograde amnesia [30, 33, 35], (b) the selectivity and specificity of RA in the light of current contents-based subdivisions of memory [39], (c) the brain loci involved in processing old memories [19, 31], (d) the typical etiology [1, 12, 17, 34]. (e) the relations between 72 findings based on normals and functional imaging tech- niques as well as on brain-damaged patients and neuropsy- chological outcome [37]. and (f) possible interhemispheric differences in retrograde memory processing [5, 13. 17. 19]. The question of whether retrograde memory deficits can occur independently of anterograde ones. is still a matter of considerable debate [19. 33]. We here report the case of an intelligent engineer, DD, who Jost access to most of his premorbid autobiographical experiences. though still able to acquire new information long-term. DD is a particularly apt example to highlight circumstances, concomitants and consequences of selective RA. Case report Three years prior to the present neuropsychological exami- nations, DD, a 53 year old right-handed academic with a doctor s degree. was - as a pedestrian - hit by a bus and severely head injured. He was comatose for six weeks (initial Glasgow Coma Scale score: 5) and thereafter seemed to have lost most of his memories. He was trans- ferred to several neurological rehabilitation centers. In spite of year-long rehabilitation treatment, his severe retrograde and anterograde memory problems persisted. DD remained blind in his right eye and has strongly corrected vision in his left (20/200) . Due to his visual problems tests depend- ing on largely normal vision could not be performed (e. g. , Trail Making Test) or could be performed only partially (e. g. . Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-revised) . After initial recovery, DD received residential treat- ment, particularly in the fields of learning and memory, for three months and thereafter day treatment as an outpatient. His fund of knowledge is still profound and was repeatedly noted. It appears to reflect his high premorbid social and professional skills. (Before his accident. he was described as being mentally faster than he could speak and faster than any one of his peers. He was regarded as being at the top of his profession. ) DD appears depressed in discussions with neuropsychologists: he wonders , , why he s alive\". but en- joys interacting with his wife. However, he also stated that he is more mad than sad and that he is a perfectionist, hating to be wrong\", and that this attitude constitutes problems for him. given his present performance. Neuroradiological findings There were repeated brain scans to determine the extent of his brain damage. Two CT scans were done immediately after his accident and demonstrated a massive intra- cerebral hematoma with bony injury to the right frontal region and marked compression of the brain and ventricles with a marked right-to-left shift. Examination of his brain injury by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed stable findings two and three years after the accident. The most recent MRI (5 months prior to neuropsychological testing) was done with Tl weighted images along sagittal. coronal and horizontal axes and with proton density and T2 weighted horizontal imaging. It showed major right-hemispheric brain damage with some H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald: Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury contre-coup damage of the left hemisphere as well. (The right side of his head was hit by the bus. ) The damage involved the right frontal lobe, the anterior right basal ganglia, the right anterior temporal lobe, the inferior ante- rior left frontal lobe as well as the genu of the corpus callo- sum. The appearance corresponds to a porencephalic cyst and encephalomalacia. There was a mild displacement of the septum pellucidum to the left of the midline and a dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate his brain damage. Neuropsychological findings Neuropsychological testing was done at several time points after his accident. Here, the findings obtained two to three years after the accident are reported. In an interview about two years after the injury, DD reported having no know- ledge of the accident or of the time surrounding it. He stated \"I used to be an organized and detailed man, Now everything happens too fast for me. \" He is aware of his memory problems and remarked spontaneously \"I feel silly about my incapacity\" and also \"I don t like being a patient, thinking of myself as handicapped\". DD also stated that his sense of time, schedule and direction are now all mixed up. Two years after the trauma he still had problems with skills such as combing his hair and dressing and was usually (for 5 days a week) accompanied by an attendant. Though he is unaware of his accident he stated \"I m more and more aware that something happened\". His scores in the Symp- tom Check List-90-R [4] are summarized in Table 1. He manifests significant somatization, significant obsessive- compulsive tendencies, mild interpersonal sensitivity, clini- cal depression, a moderate degree of anxiety, and mild phobic anxiety, a significant paranoid ideation and a mod- erate degree of psychoticism. DD s verbal intelligence score is 113 and therefore in the high upper average range. Performance IQ was esti- mated to be average but - due to his visual problems - was not adequatly testable. Other test results are listed in Table 2 T-Score 60-64 65-69 70-74 Symptomatology Somatization X Obsessive-Compulsive X Interpersonal Sensitivity xX Depression X Anxiety X Phobic Anxiety xX Paranoid Ideation xX Psychoticism X Table 1.

Then he was asked to visualize and match each word of the BSRT with the house objects. (E. g. , he matched the front door with throwing a newspaper, in order to learn the first word - \"throw\". ) **Example: MY GREATEST FEAR \"is that my daughter or son will get hit by a bus\". The examining neuropsychologist noted for DD: \"Overall, the effect is that of depression, of emotional dulling, of loss. \" Note that further test descriptions on his emotional status are given in the text. The test results (Table 2) demonstrate that DD has normal short term memory, is able to acquire new infor- mation (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, WMS-R, Buschke Selective Reminding Test) , though his perform- ance under standard testing conditions is poorer than that of normal subjects. His skill memory is generally preserved. However, when it comes to complex task situations, re- quiring cognitive flexibility and foresight, he is strongly impaired (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) - a finding clearly attributable to his extensive prefrontal damage. Information 74 H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald: Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury Fig. 1. General T1-weighted MRI scans performed about 3 years post-damage. Coronal sections from top left to bottom right demon- strate the principal loci of brain damage in the right inferior lateral prefrontal cortex (top left) , the right temporopolar cortex (top right) , and the right anterior temporal lobe (bottom left and right) processing seems to be changed insofar as DD apparently fails to show the same degree of affective resonancing which accompanies information acquisition in normals. Additionally, DD was subjected to a somewhat uncon- ventional testing procedure by restricting the set of choices in several conventional tests (e. g. , the Booklet Category Test, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, vocabulary portion [18]) . On these tests, his performance improved signifi- cantly or resulted at least in average results (see, e. g. . the Buschke Selective Reminding Test results in Table 1) From this it was concluded that his general knowledge and his abstract abilities are still preserved, but as he forgets what had been right or wrong earlier, his performance still deteriorates when long-term memory is involved and when the number of alternatives increases DD stated two years post-injury that he is not aware of retrograde memory problems. though he acknowledged that he has no memories on the time and circumstances of his injury. We administered two tests on autobiographical retrograde memoy. the Crovitz test (see refs. 9, 18, for a description) and the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) [16] In the Crovitz test we gave him words such as miracle , train , battle , assassination , revolt and asked him to relate life events he had experienced person- ally from any time period which he could associate with the words and then to estimate the date of the occurrence. He covered different time epochs from his childhood to about 5-6 years prior to the injury. However, all of the events were quite neutral in character. For example, after hearing train he responded that he used to put coins on the train track when he was about 8 years old, fire reminded him of a big fire in California, assassination recalled the kill- ing of President Kennedy, and revolt he associated with the fact that his second wife had been in Chile at the time of the revolt bringing Pinochet into power In the AMI he received largely normal values for per- sonal semantic events from the time periods childhood (18) and young aulthood (17. 5) , but was in the definitely abnormal range for actual life (15) ; similarly, with re- spect to autobiographical incidents he achieved five points, which is definitely in the abnormal range for this epoch. Though DD could still produce a number of inci- dents and events, he frequently stated that he was just H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald: Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury 75 Fig. 2. General T1-weighted MRI scans performed about 3 years post-damage. Horizontal sections from top left to bottom right demon- strate the principal loci of brain damage in the right inferior lateral prefrontal cortex (top left) , the right temporopolar cortex (top right) , and the right anterior temporal lobe (bottom left and right) guessing and that he only had vague ideas that things might have happened that way or that his wife had told these events to him after his brain injury. Some responses might be interpreted as mere guesses, for example that that he had spent last Christmas with his wife. (He did not know, e. g. , whether his brother was with them or not. ) He recalled facts such as that his wife drove with him to Salt Lake City and that they stayed in a particular hotel in a National Park (whose name he could give) , but did not know whether anything special happened during the 1, 500 mile drive. (Most of his responses were confirmed by his attendant. ) Discussion DD is a patient who, due to the severity of his brain dam- age developed from being a curious, challenging, intellec- tually vibrant and quick witted personality to a man, who is now empty of much of his prior social and intellectual abilities. Though he regained a number of basic skills over the last three years, his deficits are profound and will most likely remain substantial. These deficits become evident especially in unstructured tasks, requiring active memory, active self-organization, and continued learning from expe- rience, and they match well with what would be expected from the massive prefrontal damage. It is also in line with this type of injury that when there is external structuring of his environment - as introduced with the special acquisition of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test - his learning and later retention are excellent. This finding corresponds to that of a number of studies employing external guidance and structuring in prefrontally damaged subjects [7]. The chunking or parsing example in delayed alternation per- formance, introduced by Pribram and Tubbs [32] is an early example. 76 Though the brain damage is largely right-sided, it re- sulted in considerable and prolonged intellectual malfunc- tioning. Reasons can be sought in the profoundness of the injury and in its etiology, but also in the fact that there is some crossing of the midline with affection of anterior callosal fibers and minor damage to left hemispheric ante- rior prefrontal tissue. Nevertheless, his residual intelligence is high-average, as is his concentration ability, and he is able to acquire new information long-term (especially when this information is unidimensional or highly structured) . As prefrontal damage or hypometabolism may affect intel- ligence [10], this outcome is remarkable and indicates that his premorbid intelligence indeed was much higher than that presently assessed. Retrograde amnesia Given the pattern of brain damage, we were particularly interested in evaluating his old memories. Previous studies have indicated that the combination of right-hemispheric damage to both inferior-lateral portions of the prefrontal cortex and to anterior-lateral portions of the temporal cor- tex may severely impair the ability to ecphorize old auto- biographaphical memories [1, 13, 17, 24, 25]. (Tulving [38] used the term ecphory to describe the process by which retrieval cues interact with stored information so that an image or a representation of the information in question appears. ) In all of the above listed studies some additional damage of corresponding _left-hemispheric structures was present or suspected as well, which led Markowitsch [19] to speculate that such damage is neces- sary in order to lead to enduring retrograde amnesia. Case DD is no exception to this rule, but, on the contrary, un- derlines the hypothesis that combined damage to temporo- frontal structures of primarily the right hemisphere will lead to retrograde amnesia in the autobiographical domain [5, 19, 21]. Emotional flattening DD is depressed by his current cognitive condition. which indicates that contrary to some cases with medial dien- cephalic damage (e. g. ref. 27) , he is able to consciously reflect the change from his premorbid to his postmorbid state. Still, from his responses in the Autobiographical Memory Interview and in the Crovitz test, it is evident that he usually provides rather vague and superficial answers. Information on his personal past is produced in a rather neutral manner, devoid of affective flavoring and much of it seems to have been relearned post-injury. The question is, whether this type of response is the only one left. or whether there are some active blocking mechanisms, which hinder an overt reappearance of emo- tionally moving memories [21]. Related to this is the ques- tion of whether there is a similarity between psychogenic and organically based retrograde amnesias with the conse- quence that the failure to ecphorize emotionally colored memories to a normal frequency is due to brain mecha- nisms, which are at best very indirectly caused by the overt and measurable brain damage [21]. DD s response tenden- cies again correlate well with those observed in previous cases [1, 17, 24, 25] and are also in line with the more global theoretical concept proposed by Damasio [2]. H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald: Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury Relationship between anterograde and retrograde am- nesia A principal independence of anterograde and retrograde amnesia has been found in several patients with major lateral temporo-frontal damage, sparing the medial tempo- ral structures [1, 13, 17, 24, 25]. On the other hand, major damage to medial temporal lobe structures usually reverses the picture, with the anterograde amnesic component be- coming more prominent than the retrograde one [33]. DD seems to lie in between: He displays at least moderate an- terograde memory impairment, but this seems to originate largely from his frontal damag and therefore from im- paired mechanisms of structuring and supervising incom- ing information [36]. In addition, there is some evidence for right medial temporal involvement which, given the massive trauma to the whole right anterior third of the brain, is not surprising. We can consequently conclude that DD s case is no counterexample for the possibility of a principal independ- ence of anterograde and retrograde memory functioning. Nevertheless, his way of learning new information seems to differ from the way non-brain damaged individuals acquire autobiographical information: The newly learned informa- tion appears to be of a more neutral, affectless character, that is, it deserves the terms \"semantic memories\" or \"knowledge information\" rather than \"episodic memories\" [21]. While anterograde and retrograde amnesia may occur intermingled in cases with damage to the socalled bottle- neck structures necessary for the transfer of information for long term storage [9, 20, 30, 33, 35, 40], those with damage to the latero-polar temporal and the inferior-lateral prefrontal cortex seem to manifest only (or at least princi- pally) selective RA. Selectivity and specificity of RA in the light of current contents-based subdivisions of memory Most of the cases with selective RA (i. e. , RA in the pres- ence of a preserved capability to form and store new memo- ries long term post-injury) manifest their RA in the auto- biographical domain. Their world knowledge, including the capabilities of reading, writing, and calculating, is preserved. Their loss of retrograde memories is usually accompanied by a continued flattening of affect. The selective affection of old memories from the auto- biographical domain may have at least two reasons. One is the principal side of the brain damage. Here, both data from brain damaged patients [1, 13, 24, 25] and from functional imaging methods in normal subjects [5] point to a primary involvement of right temporo-frontal structures in autobiographical memory ecphory, and a_ left- hemispheric one in the retrieval of general knowledge infomation [19]. A second basis can be seen in the hierar- chical nature of information processing which puts epi- sodic-autobiographical information to the top of the hierar- chy of contents-related memory subdivisions and therefore makes it more vulnerable than the other systems [39]. H. J. Markowitsch and K. Ewald: Right-hemispheric fronto-temporal injury Brain loci involved in the processing of old memories As found in previous cases, the principal brain damage leading to an enduring inability to ecphorize old memories seems to lie in the combination of prefrontal and latero- anterior temporal lobe structures [19]. DD fits this scheme. From a comparison of cases with combined temporo-frontal damage and damage to the frontal lobe only. Kroll et al. [17] concluded that it needs an affection of both lobes in order to induce RA. This hypothesis seems somewhat con- tradictory to recent imaging results which emphasized the prefrontal cortex as principally involved in memory re- trieval [6. 40]. However. as was argued in Markowitsch [25]. the emphasis of the prefrontal cortex may be an arti- fact based on the use of rather neutral information which has to be retrieved, and information which has only re- cently been acquired. PET-data, based on a design of old autobiographical memory retrieval, activate predominantly the temporal lobe [5]. Consequently it is argued that prefrontal and temporal lobe regions work in synchrony, largely via the uncinate fascicle. and that the contribution of prefrontal portion is mainly one of effort. initiation, supervision, strategic plan- ning and organization [31], and that of the lateral temporal lobe is in gaining access to the near-by modules or net- works containing the respective engrams [19]. Etiology of retrograde amnesia A still unresolved question is why in most cases with en- during retrograde amnesia the initial brain damage is of traumatic origin (present case; [17, 24, 25, 34]) . One rea- son for this can be seen in the fact that traumatic brain injury is especially likely to go beyond the immediately visible damage [8, 23]. Furthermore, the severe concussion of the brain may lead to a kind of disentangling of estab- lished connections and networks or to an uncoupling of memory traces still incompletely consolidated [3, 12]. And lastly. the coma state, accompanying above all - severe trauma states. may alter the usual biochemical inflow be- tween neuronal assemblies representing stored information. Prolonged disuse, which is also a consequence of coma and concussion, may enhance these detrimental effects on ret- rograde memories.

H. Junnt A. OGDEN* Department of Psychology. University of Auckland, New Zealand (Received t7 dune 1992: accepted 15 February 1993) Abstract A number of higher visual deficits accompanied by severe retrograde autobiographical memory loss following bilateral medial occipital infarctions are described in case M. H. Assessment of M. H. s visual object agnosia and prospagnosia suggested thal he was unable to integrate the elements ofa percept to form a meaningful whole. This deficit may occur at the level the percept is encoded into the visual buffer and inspected. M. H. also describes a loss of visual memories. and it is hypothesized that this may similarly be w result of an inability tv integrate the elements of the visual representation (c. g. of an object or face) following ils generation from long-term visual memory store intu the visual buffer. M. H. s retrograde autobiographical memory loss is postulated to be a consequence of the severe impoverishment of episodic memories that must occur when events originally stared multimodaily. must he recalled without any visual component. INTRODUCTION VISUAT. OBJECT AGNOSIA, prosopagnosia and achromatopsia are all relatively uncommon disorders, and are each associated with lesions, usually bilateral, of the occipital cortex and underlying white matter. Therefore, it is not surprising that all of these visual disorders have sometimes been demonstrated in the same patient. A patient with these disorders as well a poor visual memory and a severe autobiographical memory loss is, however. more difficult to explain, especially when the patient s lesions are restricted to the occipital lobes. This paper examines the case of such a putient in detail, and explores the possibility that his autobiographical amnesia is a consequence of his visual recognition and visual memory deficits. Visual recognition disorders have fascinated neurologists for at least 100 years, a case of visual object agnosia being described as early as 1883 by CHarcotT [4]. In 1890 LissaAUER [23] proposed that there were two forms of visual object agnosia; apperceptive visual agnosia in which the basic perceptual abilities are disrupted, and associative visual agnosia, where perception of form is largely intact, but the interpretation of the meaning of the form is deficient. While finer divisions have since been postulated, Lissauer s division is still useful. Although visual agnosia ts relatively uncommon, a considerable literature on the subject has accummulated, especially in recent years (e. g. Refs [2]. [13], [16] and [33]) . Another disorder of visual recognition that has appeared in the neuropsychological * Address for correspondence: Dr J. A.

OGDEN iterature with increasing frequency in recent years is the inability to visually recognise amiliar faces, termed prosopagnosia by BODAMER in 1947 [3]. A given that the inability to recognise objects is considered to result from a more dysfunctional system than the inability to recognise faces or words. Achromatopsia is the loss of colour perception, and results from bilateral damage in the area of the prestriate cortex extending to the temporal lohe. Impaired colour perception may preclude the visualisation of colours. suggesting that other higher-order cortices are incapable of supporting the recall of perceptually-impaired colour [12]. Patients with achromatopsia would thus also have a loss of colour memory. Dr VREESE [10]. however. has described the loss of long-term colour memories in a patient with bilateral occipital damage and with relatively intact colour sensation and perception. A loss of visual memory of imagery such that the subject can copy objects accurately but cannot draw familiar objects from long-term memory store [22], and in some cases docs not experience or recall visual dreams [}. 29] has been observed in some individuals with visual object agnosia, but not in others [31]. Thus, although visual memory impuirment cannot be the reason for all cases of visual agnosia, it appears to be associated, either functionally or neuroanatomically, with some cases. An impairment of autobiographical (or episodic) memory refers to a loss of personal memories that have meaning for the individual because of the unique context in which they are embedded. Autobiographical memories are complex and involve the recall of integrated space and time-locked multimodal experiences [6]. Patients suffering from severe global amnesia as a result of bilateral medial temporal lobe damage such as in herpes encephalitis cases and the case of H. M. [5, 26], or from bilateral damage to the mid-brain structures such as occurs in Korsakoff s amnesia, cannot form new autobiographical memories, presumably because they cannot encode, or store. or retrieve the verbal and non-verbal components of those memories. Most of these patients also demonstrate a loss of retrograde auto- biographical memories extending back for a number of years prior to their lesion or onset of the disorder, with early childhood memories often remaining relutively intact. As some Korsakolf's and encephalitis patients have been shown to have cortical damage in the Irontal VISUAL AGNOSIA AND MEMORY LOSS. 573 lobes, or throughout the whole brain (17, 18], dysfunction of these areas may also contribute to the amnesia of these patients. In some cases (e. g. H. M. and Korsakoff s subjects) the retrograde amnesia (RA) may in part be the result ofa long history of epilepsy, medication, or alcoho] intake. GOLDBERG et al. [15] proposed that the RA observed in their patient was due to a small, selective Icsion severing ascending reticular projections into the hippocampi and mammil- lary bodies. Severely head-injured patients can also experience a loss of retrograde autobiographical memories [30], but in severe cases where the amnesia does not recover ot shrink , there is usually extensive diffuse damage or damage throughout the frontal and temporal lobes. The case of BosweLt [6, 8] who demonstrated a loss of autobiographical memories, had extensive bilateral lesions of the anterior and medial temporal lobes, the basal forebrain, and the posterior part of the orbitofrontal cortices. A encephalitis patient described by O Connor et al. [25] suffercd from visual agnosia, severe visuoperceptual deficits, a severe retrograde autobiographical amnesia but only mild anterograde amnesia. They suggested that her loss of past autobiographical memories might be explained in part by her visuoperceptual deficits, if this limited her ability to generate and manipulate visual images. This presupposes that recalling detailed past autobiographical events requires intact visual imagery abilities. If this interpretation is correct, then one might expect to find other cases in the literature who demonstrate visual imagery impairments (and possibly visual agnosia) and also have difficulty recalling autobiographical events. Unfortunately, most studies that focus on deficits of visual imagery exclude patients with visual agnosia, and do not assess retrograde autobiographical amnesia. The following case study of M. H. adds further data to the visual agnosia literature as well as to the literature on retrograde amnesia. His deficits are described in detail, and then an attempt is made to explain them in relation to one another and to his lesions as seen on MRI scan. CASE HISTORY M. H. , a healthy, 24-year-old, right-handed, Caucasian man, a Lance Corporal employed issuing equipment in the Army stores, was admitted to the Critical Care Unit of Auckland Hospital following an accident in which the motorcycle he was riding hit a tree. On admission he was deeply comatose with a Glasgow Coma Score of 3 and unreactive pupils that responded to mannitol. He was intubated and ventilated, and a CT brain scan revealed swelling of the right hemisphere with some shift of the midline to the left, and narrow basal cisterns. A repeat CT scan following a second episode of unreactive pupils on day 6 showed further swelling which responded well to mannitol and hyperventilation. M. H, also sustained multiple orthopaedic injuries to his left limbs and ribs, as a result of which he had his left arm amputated, and 7 years later still walks with a severe limp. Five weeks following his accident, M. H. regained consciousness, opening his eyes and obeying requests, following which he was transferred to an orthopaedic ward for a further 11 weeks. His head injury was never properly ussessed, presumably because his orthopaedic injurics, being more critical, took precedence. A review of his hospital chart reveals minimal and conflicting information on his visual deficits. His mother said he was blind from the time he regained consciousness at 5 weeks, but at this time the only report from a neurosurgeon stated that he had diplopia. A note made by the occupational therapist at 9 weeks stated that his sight was very bad but that he did at times seem able to look at an object and recognise it. A report by an opthalmologist at 10 574 J. A. OGpeEN weeks stated that he was cortically blind. On discharge from hospital at 16 weeks he had mild spasticity of the right hand, and good expressive and receptive speech. The NZ Foundation for the Blind assessed him as totally blind, and enrolled him in their full-time, live-in, rehabilitation programme. At 21 months he was a passenger in a car at night and noticed the moving lights of other cars, and began to be aware of movement on television. An intensive programme to improve his sight was commenced. Over the next 4 months he progressed from being unable to read letters or words to being able to trace the outlines of letters and then recognising them. At this stage he was able to read shart words such as it and the , but was completely unable to recognise any objects or people on sight. After a further 3 months of intensive rehabilitation. he could recognise numerals, use a telephone and locate his ash tray. He could read simpie booklets, and read his digital watch. When shown a real object or a line drawing or photograph of an object, he could not recognise it, but could describe the shape of the object. and could sometimes work out what the object was from his own description of its shape. His ability to recognise objects via touch, sound or smell was completely normal. Seven years after his accident he remains unable to recognise most objects on sight, although he can now recognise a few commonly used objects such as his comb, cigarette lighter and ash tray. and he is completely unable to recognise faces on sight. His other most debilitating problems are his apparent loss of most retrograde autobiographical memories, and his impaired ability to learn new verbal information. He does remember songs from his past, and demonstrates a reasonable ability to learn new songs. M. H. has a very positive outlook on life, and throughout his rehabilitation has remained highly motivated and eager to be as independent as possible. He has graduated to living im his own flat, with daily help. He remains unable to leave his flat unaccompanied because of his poor sight and visual agnosia, and his severe limp. His interactions with others are intelligent and appropriate, and his positive outlook on life des not appear to be the result of any marked frontal-lobe dysfunction. I first assessed M. H. ncuropsychologically 3 years post- trauma, and have assessed him a number of times since then. An MRI scan was carried out 6 years post-trauma (see Fig. [) . It shows allered signal within the medial aspects of both occipital lobes affecting grey matter and subcortical white matter. The changes are more prominent in the right occipital lobe and the appearance is consistent with ghosis. This is an old process as there is evidence of quite prominant focal dilatation of both occipital horns. The forward-travelling pathways to the temporal lobes are damaged on both sides, and on the right side the forward-travelling pathways to the parietal lobe are also damaged. There is also mild dilatation of the remainder of both lateral ventricles and of the third ventricle, that may be post-traumatic in aetiology. A small focus of abnormal signal is seen in the postcrior limb of the left internal capsule. This is also likely to represent an arca of gliosis, that may be due to a previous lacunar infarction. Reviews of the CT scans taken in the weeks after the accident revealed a focal area of decreased attenuation in this vicinity. No other arcas of signal abnormality are seen within the brain. In particular, there are no signs of altered signal within the frontal or temporal lobes. Appearances of the cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem are within normal limits, and no craniocervical abnormality is seen. An extensive optometry cxamination carried out 7 years post-trauma reported M. H. 's unaided distance visual acuities as right eye 6/24 and left eye 6/48 + 2, improving to right eye 6/12 and left eye 6/12 with distance spectacle refraction of right 2. 0 and left 1. 0.

Central field-testing using a Bjerrum screen and 10 mm white target revealed a 4 5 central field in the right eye, and 5 central field in the left eye. Atan assessment 3 years previously, central fields were about 5 in the left eye and 8 in the right eve using the Amsler grid, and about 8 for both eyes using the Aimark perimeter. There was a left exotropia (40 prism dioptres) and a right hypotropia (10 prism dioptres) showing that M. H. usually uses his right eye. Ocular motility appeared full in all directions. Slit-lamp examination revealed no abnormalities in either eye. No numbers were discernable on testing with the Ishihara colour plates held at 1. 5 m to compensate for the visual field constriction. Using the Oscar colour vision test, the right eye showed a red deficit, while the left eye showed normal red/green colour sensitivity. On the panel D-15 colour test (a test in which coloured caps have to be sorted into a colour sequence) the right eye gave an achromatic response while the Icft cye showed some colour vision. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT General inreflecrual abilities Assessments on the Verbal subtests of the WAIS R 3 and 6 ycars post-trauma demonstrated that M. H. s verbal abilities had stabilised, his Verbal 1Q falling easily within the Average range. The only subtests in which he scored below 10 were Information (score of 8} and Arithmetic (score of 4) . Difficulties on Information appeared to be due to his retrograde amnesia; e. g. he did not know the capital of Italy, in spite of the fact he had clearly known this as a navy seaman prior to his employment in the army. When given written WAIS R Arithmetic sums to do using paper and pencil. his score improved markedly. suggesting part of his difficulty was a result of his poor ability ta hold complex information in working memory. He scored tO on both Similarities and Digit Span, in the latter subtest repeating 7 digits forward and 5 backward. His highest scores were 12 on Vocabulary and 15 on Comprehension. He had no difficulty with the meanings of proverbs or many of the more difficull Similarity items. suggesting that his frontal-lobe functions fell within normal limits. Performance subtests were unable to be given because of his visual agnosia and tunnel vision Apraxia, acalculia. and finger agnosia M. H. performs at normal levels on apraxia tests. He can pantomime brushing his hair, cleaning his teeth, opening a letter, and other actions, and is able to imitate gestures accurately. He can perform all types of basic arithmetic calculations involving the carrying of figures, both mentally and on paper. He has no finger agnosia. Language abilities and perception and recognition of letters and words M. H. s speech is fluent and his comprehension normal. He can paint accurately on command to lower and upper case letters displayed randomly on a page. Ifis reading of text is slow, apparently because of his tunnel vision, bul accurate. Words in small print and held at 1. 5 m lo compensate for his visual field contriction were read fluently. His writing and printing of individual letters, words and sentences spontancously and to dictation is slow but gencraily accurate, and he can read his own printing. His reading of handwriting is slower and less accurate than his reading of print. His imagery of letters is intact. When asked to imagine a letler and decide whether it has curved or straight sides he is able 1o respond accurately. Diagnostic tests of visual object agnosia Visual perception. M. H1. s performance was 100% accurate on each of the following tasks. (1) Discrimination of line drawings of triangles with curved sides from those with straight sides. (2) Pointing to the shortest and longest lines on pages of lines of different lengths. (3} Pointing ta and recognising different shapes and different sizes of the same shape (squares. rectangles. circles, hexagons etc) on pages of shapes, and drawing shapes accurately on command. In addition, M. H. can copy line drawings of objects in a slow and disjointed fashion, without recognising what he is drawing (see Fig. 2}. When asked what his copy of the turtle was, he said he did not know but perhaps it could be a bird. He would not even guess the identity of the bird. Visual recognition of objects. M. H. s tactile and auditory recognition of objects, people and animals is unimpaired. but he can recognise on sight only a very small number of objects and animals thal he has seen many times. Ona formal test where he was shown 30 real abjects. he could recognise only eight af them, and these were all abjects he had been shown often as part af his rchabilitation programme. The objects and M. H. s naming latencies are listed in the order given to M. H. in Table 1. When shown an object, or a visual representation of an abject. his strategy is ta describe its shape to himself, and 578 JA. OGDEN ae M. H. 's copies of drawings. The models are in the left column and M. H. \"s copes in the right column.

When shown a key, he described il us a circle: there isa long thin piece off one side; iL is smooth on the top but seems to have a jagged edge on the bottom . but could not recognise it. As soon as he picked it up, he recognised it mstantly as a key His ability lo recognise photographs. realistic three-dimensional paintings of objects. and line drawings of objects appears slightly more impuired than his ability to recognise real objects. For example, he recognised a real telephone in 4 see (he uses a telephone in his own house frequently |, but was still unable to recognise a line drawing of a similar telephone alter 35 see of trying. | then said ring. ring , and he said Oh. is that what it is, a telephone . One hour later when shown the same drawing. he was able to identify it correctly in sec. He recognised nwo items, a house (8 secl. and a spoon {6 sec) ina series of 20 black-and-while photographs af common items. He was shown 30 realistic, coloured painings of common objects and animals m context (e. g. sheep in a paddock, a baby cating from a bowl. apples on a tree, fruit in a bowl) taken from a series of books used for teaching 4-year-old children the names of objects and animals. He was asked to name specilig objects in cach painting. He was able to correctly name only (wo items. a pen (3 see) and a person (4 seul, He was able to identily some animals as animals after describing their form to himself. but was not able lo identify any specific animal correctly. [n all of the above experiments, he was given a minimum of 60 sec before being permitted to give up, and longer if he thought he might be able lo recognise the item given more ime MH. is also severely impaired on the naming of line drawings of single vbjects or living things, and oul of a scrics of 60. named only three, This experiment, also used Lo assess cutegory-specific visual recognition, is detailed in the next section Over trials, M. H. , dogs learn Lo recognise his descriptions of the abjects he sces, and becomes faster at identilying them with repeated exposures. When first shown a line drawing of an elephant, he attempted to deserrbe its shape. but was still unable to recognise itafter 30 sec. He was then told ic was an animal, but this did not assist him, He was then given the names of five animals and asked which one it was. He correctly selected elephant and was then able to point to the trunk. One hour later he was shown the same drawing, and alter 9 sec was able to identify ib as an animal because it has four legs , but could not be more specilic. When shown the same line drawing 2 years later. he was once again completely unable to identify it, or even correctly categorise it as an animal. Cutegory-specifte risual recognition. No broad category of abject appeared easier or harder for him than any ather. He was shown a series of 60 line drawings falling randomly within cach of the following categories: vegetables. fruits, plants. animals, insects. natural phenomenon, clothing, bathroom and household implements, tools, musical instruments, transportation, and body parts. [n all but three categaries his recognition was nil, and he recognised one object out of the five in the categories of fruits (apple. 4 see) , bathroom and household implements ttoothbrush. 6 sec) . and clothing (trousers. 10 sec) , in each cuse alter making a number of guesses based on its shape.

A toothbrush he described as similar to a spoon of fork wrth bits coming up a Loathbrush!\" When shown a drawing of a cal sitting upright facing the camera. he described it as follows: Here isa face. and these look like legs: it must be a person! Elis ability to visually recognise ling drawings of living things was thus as severely impaired as his ability to visually recognise non-living things. When M.

Large objects (e. g. telephone) were placed on the lable in front of a blindfolded M. H. and his right hand was placed on the abject. Small objects (e. g. key) were placed in his right hand. He was free to manipulate the objects us he wished, and when necessary they were held steady while he explored them. While blindfolded, M. H. was asked to name 20 sounds (given in the following order) : Water being poured from a jug into a cup, the rattle of a bunch of keys. brushing tecth with a tooth brush, the ring of a telephone, the sound of rain outside the building, footsteps, a noise of baa-a-a like a sheep, a door opening, a nose being blown, a match being struck on the side of a match box, the sound of a car starting up outside the window, a noise of woo! like a dog, scissors culting paper, a sniff. a noise of moo like a cow, a book page being turned, a door being closed, a noise of quack like a duck, the sound of a kiss, a cough. He named all sounds correctly within 1 sec. Semantic knowledge of objects. When given the name or other identifying information about an object or animal (e. g. something that goes miaow ) , and asked to describe it. his performance was normal with regard to function in almost all cases. When given the names, he was able tu describe the function of all the objects listed in Table 1. He was also able Lo provide factual information and describe the functions of living objects and natural phenomena (e. g. trees. specific animals, clouds, mountains) . In contrast, he was frequently unable to describe the shape of the object 580 J. A. OGDEN or living Uhing accurately. For example. when asked whal a cup is he said it is made out of pottery or china and is for drinking out of. When asked about its shape, he said that i! was hollow with a handle to hold it by. When asked if he could visualise a cup he said he could not, but that he knows he picks it up by a handle to drink from, and it must be hollow to hold coffee. When asked what a canary was. he said it was a small bird that whistled, but he could not quite see its shape. He thought il had two legs. He did not know what the colour was, but thought it might be blue. Pisual imagery and the ability ta draw objects from long-term preniary M. IH. can quickly and accurately draw from memory triangles. squares, rectangles. crosses, and circles. He can draw shapes of different sizes on command, and lines of different lengths. For example, he responds accurately when asked to draw a line across the top of the page. and underneath it a line of half the length of the first one. He can draw a large circle above a cross, and a small circle below the cross. He can also draw on command seme objects with simple shapes; e. g. a rugby ball, a basket ball. a rugby field, an apple, a banana. M. H. can draw in a simplistic fashion some more complex comman objects on command. He wis able to draw a recognisable house. and key (see Fig. 3) . but his drawing ofa Mower looked more like a palm tree. and he drew a bed as a rectangle with four legs. He would not even altempt mere complex or unfamiliar objects, such as a telephone or a broom because he said he could not think how they might look. He was also unable to draw or visualise any specific objects. such as the house he grew up in Fig. 3. M. H. 's drawing of a key and a house from long-term memory. When asked to visualise and describe a surf beach he had spent a great deal of lime at before his accident (and has been to since) . he said he could imagine the waves and the sand and hear the surf, but he did not deseribe the seenic surrounds of bush, cliffs. and rocky peninsulas. When asked the colour of the sand he said iL was pale in colour. when in fact the sands are very distinctive black iron sands. Thus it appears that M. H. is unable to visualise (locate in long-term store, or bring into awareness) objects and scenes [rom long-term memory store, or alternatively. he has lost the visual memory templates themselves. The drawings he is able lo do and his verbal descriptions of visual forms frem memory are impoverished and non- specific, and probably represent a stylised prototype of the object category. MH. also denies having dreams, suggesting a loss of the ability to generate visual images. Prosopagnosia M. H. has a total inability to recognise any faces on sight, and this has not improved over the 7 years since his accident. Practice and familiarity do not help; he never recognises his mother unul she speaks in spite of the fact he sees her almost daily. He is unable to pick out any familiar face including his own in family photographs taken before and after his accident. M. H. was shown a collage of phatographs of faces of people famous and well known to him betore his accident. and faces of people he wauld never have seen. When asked to point to any faces that seemed more familiar to him, he said none of them seemed familiar. When asked to verbally describe from memary the very distinctive face of a VISUAT. AGNOSIA AND MEMORY LOSS 581 famous N. Z. Prime Minister who had been in the public eye for many years before and after M. H. s accident, M. H. said (accurately) that he had a lopsided smile. When he was then asked to guess which of the faces on the collage was this man s face, he pointed to a face of an unknown man. M. H s ability to discriminate gender, age and expressian of faces is alsa very impaired. He would sometimes guess gender correctly by the length of hair, but when this was controlled for he performed at chance levels, When asked to say whether a face looked happy or sad, he would rely on the shape of the mouth, and made numerous errors. When asked how old a baby s face in a photograph might be, he said it looked like an old man because it did not have much hair. M. H. instantly recognised faces as soon as they spoke. When shown a photograph ofa face and asked to match it to the identical face in a pair of faces, he performed correctly on all eight trials, but took a long time. generally matching the face on the hair line. M. H. could recognise face and hody parts at a better than chance level, ifhe knew that what he was looking at was a face pact or a body part. He usually took a few seconds to make an identification, and sometimes made errors, giving an incorrect, bul related body-part name; . g. foot for hand. With the instruction that he was looking at parts of the head, he was able to correctly identify an eye (2 sec) , a mouth (2 sec) , a nose (5 sec) , and an ear (16 sec) , when shown to him on separate cards. He was able to identify a face as a face, but often made crrors across species. For example, he identified pictures of the faces of a teddybear, cat and monkey as human faces. When asked to point to face or budy parts on himself he had no difficulty. Given his tunnel vision, it was difficult for him to locate bady parts on others while still being within arms reach, and he performed poorly at this task. Achromatopsia and loss of colour memory M. H. could not identify any colours whether in isolation or in the context of an object. He commented that he saw everything as shades between white and black. When asked to name the colour of tokens, he was correct anly on white and biack tokens. All other colours he named either white or pale , or black or dark . Yellow he called white , and dark bluc he called black , When asked to graup tokens according to their colour he made twa piles; one he called dark and the other pale . When M. H. was asked to give the colours of named (but not seen) objects, animals, or natural phenomena, he was usually correct with regard to natural phenomena that are frequently and stereotypically associated with their colour name, such as blue sky, white clouds, blue sea. green grass, white snow. He made numerous errors on most non-living and living things. For example. a banana was guessed to be either green or blue, and although he decribed a strawberry as a small sweet berry that grows on low bushes and is caten with sugar and cream, he could not visualise its shape or its colour. Toast was dark and an apple was brown. A sparrow he described correctly as a small common bird, but was unable to visualise or remember its colour. He guessed it to be blue, and when told it was brown he suid this did nat enable him to visualise it. When asked what cotour his skin was, he first said it was blue, and when told that was wrong, said pinkish-white. Memory deficits New verbal learning. M. H. s forward digit span was 7, and his backwards digit span 5. On the Wechsler Memory Scale, he scored 1 . D. below his age mean on the immediate recall of the Logical Memory Passages, and was able to recall only two ideas from the passages following a 10-min delay. Cues did not result in further recall. On the Associate Learning subtest he scored perfectly on the high frequency word pairs on the second and third trials, but was able to learn only two of the four difficult word pairs by the third trial. On Oral Selective Reminding, M. H. s performance was moderately impaired. This test requires a list of 12 high frequency, unrelated words read to the subject to be learned over t2 trials, the subject being reminded before cach trial of the words he did not recall on the previous trial. M. H. committed only seven of the 12 wards to long-term store, though his ability to consistenUy Tetrieve these seven words from long-term store fell at the lower end of the average range. To assess visual verbal recognition memory he was given the Recognition Memory Test [32]. This was difficult for him because of his tuanel vision and long reading latency, and his severely impaired score of 32/50 may not have been a valid indicator of his yerbal recognition memory. When the test was repeated auditorily on a different occasion, he scored at chance, getting only 24/50 correct. In contrast with his impaired scores on formal tests of new verbal learning, M. H. demonstrates quite a good functional verbal memory for conversations that hold significance for him. He can recall the gist of conversations he and I had up to 3 years previously, and has apparently norma! recall of the names and other semantic information about the people currently in his life. For cxample, when | telephoned MH. on my return from a year-long study leave overseas, on giving him my name he immediately reponded by asking me how my trip was, and what new tests and rehabilitation ideas I had discovered that might be helpful for him! Autobiographical memory. One of M. H. s most striking deficits is his dense loss of personal memories prior to his accident. His mother, other family members, and friends he has had throughout his school and career in the armed forces have al} spent many hours retelling M. -H. about his past. M. H. rarely demonstrates any recognition on hearing the stories, and when he does it usually transpires that he has been told about that purticular episode before. M. H. himself often comments that he cannot really remember the decribed episode, but has learned about it since. A striking example of his retrograde autobiographical memory loss is his 21st birthday, which was a large celebration 582 J. A. Ocipen only 3 years before his accident. M. H. has absolutely so recall of this, in contrast lo his [riendy and mother who were there and remember it in detail. In an attempt to quantify M. H. s autobiographical memory loss, he was given the Autobiographical Memory Interview [19]. This is a semi-structured interview schedule with two components. The first, called the personal semantic schedule , assesses the subject's recall of facts from his own past life (c. g. names of friends, name of schoal he went to) . The second, called the autobiographical incidents schedule , assesses the subject's recall of specific events in his life (e. g. an incident that occurred while at primary school) . Memaries of cach type are assessed across three periods; childhood, carly adult life, and recent life, and the total possible score for each time period is 63 for personal facts and 27 for personal events M. IL was given this test in the presence ofa friend he had had since primary school, and an older family friend who had known M. H. and his family throughout M. H. s life. All information recalled by M. H. was checked with them. ar if they did not know if M. H. was correct. his mother was asked. M. EL. s scores for the childhood period (up to the age of 16 years) . were ({. 3 for personal facts (acceptable range, 16 21}. and 2 for personal events (acceptable range. 6 9) . Both scores fell in the definitely abnormal range (i. c. below the score of all control subjects) . His scores for the early adult period {the 8 years immediately prior to his accident) also fell in the definitely abnormal range. his scores being 7. 5 for persunal facts tacceptable range. 17 21) and 0 for personal events (acceptable range, 7 9) . His scores for recent life (i. e. over the 7 years since his accident) were somewhat better, but still fell in the definitely abnormal range. They were 16 for personal facts facceptable range, [9 21) , and 4 for personal cvents (acceptable range. 7 9) , While clearly impaired, M. U. s functional autobiographical memory for personal events subsequent to his accident is nevertheless far beer than his dense retrograde autobiographical amnesia. He can recall some events of the previous day and weeks. and his recall of both recent and more distant events is improved when he is given cues. For example, though he cannot spontanegusly recall many of the tests | have given him, when being retested he often comments correctly that he remembers being given a test previously. Forexample. when given the WAIS-~R 3 years alter first being given it. he remembered a specilic item in the Comprehension subtest, and commented correcthy that he had given a silly answer to it at first In general, the further distant the post-accident event. the less likely MHL. is to remember il, unless it had particular significance for him. The events post-accident that M. H. can spontaneously recall tend to be pleasurable, non-routine or emotionally significant. Some typical examples occurred during my telephone call with M. HL. after had been away a year. On being asked what he had done on the previous weekend. he told me he had been lo a meal al his neighbour's house on Friday (4 days previously) . and (o a barbecue at his friend's house on Lhe Saturday. When asked if he could tell me more aboul the barbecue, he said he had a ball , had some really good spicy sausages. and got drunk later in the evening, [Je remembered accurately that it was a beautiful. summer day (the first for many Saturdays) . When asked if he could recapture the smell and tastes of the burhecue in his mind. he said this was culsy for him, and that he could also recapture the good feelings he had at the barbecue. Ie contrast he had no visual memory of the occasion, T also asked MHL. about a good friend of his that} had met a year previously. and who had been having some difficulties following a minor head injury. M. H. was clearly saddened to tell me about two very upsetting events [hat had happened to his friend that year. He remembered details of these traumatic events well even though his friend had subsequently moved to anather town and M. -H. had not seen him for some time. When we lalked further about this M. H. said he seemed to remember feelings and usually the reasons for them very clearly This sparing of some of the non-visual components of his memories of events does not appear to extend to events prior to his accident. other than ina very general sense: e. g. the saund, smeff and feel of a motorbike brings back pleasurable non-specific memories of riding one. The non-spevificity of these retrograde, non-visual memories may in part be a consequence of the long time period (over 7 years} since the events occurred, M. H. does shaw some recall of retrograde auditory, non-verbal stimuli that had persanal significance for him Prior to entering the army. M. H. had spent 2 years as a seaman in the Navy specialising in sonar. and while still a patient in hospital he could reeognise the horns of specitic ships in the harbour, clase hy Lhe hospital, When in hospital he was also able to recognise his friends by their voices. and he can still remember both the melody and words of some songs popular prior to his accident DISCUSSION M. H. 's case adds to the literature another example of visual object agnosia with prosopagnosia but no alexia. His medial occipital lesion on the right is more extensive than the similar lesion on the left, and thus fits well with Faran s [13. 14] hypothesis. She suggests that right-sided posterior lesions that result in visual object agnosia must also result in prosopagnosia. while left-sided lesions resulting in visual object agnosia must also result in alexia. When he first recovered his sight following 2] months of cortical blindness, M. H. was alexic, but with rehabilitation this rapidly improved. presumably because the occipital VISLIAL AGNOSIA AND MEMORY LOSS: 583 temporal pathways on the left were at least partly intact. His prosopagnosia has never recovered, suggesting damage to the medial occipital regions bilaterally [7], but more extensively in the right hemisphere [14]. A superficial assessment of M. H. s visual object agnosia would place it within the associative agnosias rather than the apperceptive agnosias [23], given M. H. s relatively intact perception of objects. As HUMPHREYS and RIDDOCH [16] have demonstrated, however, this dual classification is too simplistic to explain all cases of visual object agnosia, in that it implies that impaired perception and impaired association of the perceived object with its meaning ure the only possible dysfunctional cognitive processes underlying object agnosia. They categorise their case, H. J. A. (16, 28], as having integrative object agnosia. This ts based on their finding that H. J. A. s visual perception of objects, while not impaired at the early stages of perception, is impaired at a later level of perception. Although he can copy line drawings quite well, he does so in a fragmented manner, and when he describes the shape of the object he is viewing, he does so feature by feature. Humphreys and Riddoch propose that his problem is at the level of integrating the features of an object into a perceptual whole, M. H. appears to have a deficit very similar to that of H. J. A. on tests of visual object agnosia. M. H. can perceive simple shapes but not objects, and while he can copy drawings of complex objects, he does so line by line, or element by element. Likewise, when verbally describing the shape of an object, he does so in a fragmented way. Therefore, it would seem that M. H. could also be classified as having integrative agnosia. M. H. is also similar to H. J. A. in that he has achromatopsia, and additional evidence of impairment of colour memory. M. H. s spared ability to recall the colours of some natural phenomena is likely to be based on well-learned verbal associations of those phenomena with their colour names. M. H. s severely impaired colour perception is readily explained by his bilateral lesions extending into the prestriate cortex, and his loss of colour memory could be explained by Faran s [12] hypothesis that a loss of colour perception probably precludes the ability to imagine colours, or remember the colours of objects. Bilateral damage to the prestriate cortex might destray common templates supporting both the perception of colour and memories of colour. De Vreuse s [10] case of a patient with bilateral posterior Icsions who demonstrated intact colour perception but impaired colour memory supports a different hypothesis however; that the templates for colour perception and colour memory are functionally separate but anatomically close. M. H. s case could fit cither of these hypotheses. M. H. s reading ability is difficult to assess because of his tunnel vision. His tendency to read syllable by syllable, or with larger printing letter by letter, may be because he can only see a portion of each ward at a lime. H. J. A. did not have tunnel vision, and read ina similarly slow manner, and was assessed as a letter-by-letter dyslexic. His problem with integrating letters to make a whole word appears to be another consequence of his integrative agnosia. The possibility remains that M. H. ulso has lettcr-by-Ietter dyslexia, and that his slow, dysfluent reading is not solely the result of his tunnel vision. Nevertheless, he can read single words fluently if they are positioned so that they fall within the intact region of his visual fields, and there is a very marked difference in severity between his extreme impairment in Tecognising objects and faces, and his slowness in reading text. It may be that integrative agnosia can be subdivided along the lines suggested by Farau [13, 14], such that bilateral posterior lesions more extensive on the right can result in an integrative agnosia that affects the perception of faces more than the visual perception of words, whereas if the lesion on the left is more extensive, the integrative agnosia will result in a greater impairment of reading, and faces will be relatively spared. S84 J. A. OGDEN H. J. A. like M. H. also has severe prosopagnosia, and this suggests that in the case of H. J. A. there is critical damage to the occipital-temporal pathways in both the left and right hemispheres, whereas in M. H. s case, the damage is clearly more extensive on the right side. Prosopagnosia can be conceptualised as a consequence of the failure to integrate the parts of a face in such a way as to form a specific and familiar face. M. H. could quite easily recognise a face as a face, and could identify separate parts of a face if tald that he was indeed looking ata face part, but no amount of time and trial-and-error guesswork enabled him to identify a face correctly. Clearly, the strategy he uses to help him recognise objects (describing the shape and guessing what it might be from his own verbal description) , does not help him with faces. Any general verbal description ofa face is not able to be recognised as a specific face, because of the impossibility of capturing with words its complex spatial dimensions. A clear discrepancy between the cases of M. H. and H. J. A. is found in their abilitics to generate and recall visual images. H. J. A. has not lost his stored knowledge about the appearance of abjects, as demonstrated by his excellent ability to draw complex objects fram long-term memory. Whether or not he can recall visual dreams, or can generate visual images at willis not reported. In contrast, M. H. does appear to have an impaired ability to recall the appearance of complex objects, and is able to draw only simplistic outlines of some common objects. He alsa denies dreaming and gives impoverished descriptions of scenes that were once well-known ta him. He reports that he is completely unable to visualise any once- familiar faces. When given the name of an object. he can provide only an impoverished description of its appearance, but in contrast provides a good functional description. His visual memory loss does not extend to letters and simple shapes, as M. H. can quickly and correctly decide ifa lower case letter presented to him orally has curved or straight sides, and reports that he can visualise shapes (such as a football field or a football) easily. It is possible that M. H. s visual memory deficits are independent of his visual object agnosia and prosopagnosia, and that like H. J. A. his difficulty with recognising objects and faces lies with the integration of object and face parts at the perceptual level. Given, however, that the visual stimuli that M-H. cannot recognise are identical to those that he cannot visualise, a more likely explanation would involve deficient mechanisms at a deeper cognitive Jevel that affect both visual imagery and visual perception. The damage M. H. sustained may, for example, have resulted in the impoverishment or even loss of the visual memory templates where the visual representations of complex objects and faces are stored, or alternatively the mechanism that brings these stored visual images into awareness could he deficient. [fit is assumed that to visually recognise an object or a face it must be matched to a stored visual representation that in turn allows access to stored (semantic) knowledge about the object or face, such a loss of visual memory templates could explain M. H. s visual object agnosia and prosopagnosia. His ability to recognise some objects could be a result of access via his verbal description to the semantic knowledge store about the object. This fits with the errors he makes, which tend to be based on a structural rather than functional similarity between the object and his incorrect response. This explanation of M. H. s visual agnosia does not, however, account for his apparent difficulty with integrating the elements of an object at the late perceptual level. A third possibility in M. H. s case is that the long-term visual memory templates may be intact and, in addition, M. H. may have no difficulty in generating a visual image from long- term memory into short-term memory. In terms of the componential models of visual imagery and visual perception of Kosstyn [20, 21] and Faram [11], the problem may instead be at the level where the image generated in the visual buffer is inspected . The a VISUAL AGNOSIA AND MEMORY LOSS 58. visual buffer is the medium where visual images are constructed and maintained in an analogue form that the subject can consciously inspect and mentally transform . The visual buffer is postulated to be common to both visual perception where the retinal image is encoded into the visual buffer, and to visual memory, where the image is generated into the visual buffer from long-term visual memory store. It may be that at the stage of inspecting the visual image generated in the visual buffer from long-term memory store, M. H. cannot recognise it because he is unable to integrate its parts. As a result, he experiences a loss of visual memories. Because of the fragility of the image in the visual buffer, M. H. is unable to use his strategy of verbally describing the form of the image to himself, in order to access semantic knowledge about it via a verbal roule. According to this model, M. H. s visual object agnosia and prosopagnosia could result both from his inability at the late perceptual level to integrate the elements and parts of an object or face into a spatially meaningful whole, and from his inability to integrate the elements of a visual memory of an object of face. Both deficits occur at the stage of inspecting the image (percept or memory) in the visual buffer. This is perhaps the most plausible explanation, given the close match between M. H. s missing visual memories and the visual stimuli he cannot recognise, his demonstrated difficulty at the perceptual level with integrating elements to form a complex whole, and the unlikelihood that such an extensive loss of stored visual memories could result from localised brain damage. M. H. also has a deficit of new verbal learning, formal testing demonstrating a moderate to severe impairment on word recognition and long term storage of new verbal material. His retrieval of stored words was only mildly impaired. In day-to-day life, M. H. is noted to havea poor memory for new information such as the dates and times of appointments, but his quite good ability to spontancously recall some important conversations and to learn new names and verbal facts about people demonstrates that he does have the capacity to learn new verbal material if it has meaning for him. His Icarning of new non-verbal material is untestable in the visual modality because of his visual agnosia, but there is some anecdotal evidence that he can learn new auditory, non-verbal material (i. e. new tunes) . M. H. s anterograde verbal memory deficit suggets that M. H. has sustained some diffuse de~. age to his left medial temporal lobe that is not apparent on MRI scan, or a pathway essential to encoding or storing verbal information may be dysfunctional. Another possibility is that M. H. s loss of visual imagery may disadvantage his learning of verbal material, given that it is well established that most people find visual imagery to be a helpful strategy in verbal learning [27]. The other memory impairment M. H. demonstrates that is only rarely observed in patients with visual agnosia, is a very severe and extensive loss of retrograde autobiographical memories that is disproportionate to his less severe anterograde verbal memory deficit (ef. Ref. [25]) . While his memories for personal events since his accident are certainly impaired, he does recall over many months some anterograde events that have strong emotional components (e. g. events associated with a close friend s emotional problems) , or more recent events that have enjoyable non-visual sensations associated with them (e. g. his spontaneous recall of the warmth of the sun, and the smells, tastes, and good feelings he experienced at a barbecuc) . M. H. s MRI scan was reviewed with specific attention to the temporal and frontal lobes, as bilateral damage to these areas has been associated with loss of autobiographical memory [5, 6, 8, 25]. No damage was observed in these areas, although given the severity of M. H. s hcad injury it would be reasonable to assume that there may be some white matter damage in these 586 J. A. OGDEN regions too diffuse to be picked up on MRI scan. Nevertheless, the extent and/or specificity of damage to frontal and temporal cortex and underlying white matter in most documented cases of autobiographical memory loss is much more extensive and dense than might be sufficient for anterograde verbal or visual memory impairment, and therefore should be quile apparent on MRI scan. It is possible that M. H. has a lesion in the ascending reticular projections into the hippocampi and mammillary bodies, as described by GOLDBERG ef al. [15] to explain the RA of their patient. His RA, however. included loss of gencral information, personal facts and personal] and public events extending back 20 years to the age of 16 years, whereas M. H. s RA spared some gencral information as well as a small number of personal facts, and his autobiographical amnesia had little, if any, temporal gradient (i. e. his early childhood memories were as impaired as his memories of events in the years immediately preceding his accident) . The visual agnosic patient, L. D. . described by O'Connor et al. [25] also demonstrated a retrograde autobiographical memory extending back into childhood, with some sparing of general and personal facts. O'Connor et al. suggested that L. D. s visuoperceptual impairments could limit her ability to generate and manipulate visual images, which may in turn contribute to her loss of event memories. M. H. 's visual problems are far more extensive than those of L. D. Not only does he have a much more severe case of visual object agnosia, and a well-demonstrated visual imagery impairment, but unlike L. D. he also has prosopagnosia and achromatopsia. Therefore it seems reasonable to postulate that his loss of autobiographical memories is a result of his inability to recall old visual memories (of objects, faces and colours) , tn combination with his inability to establish new visual memories because of his visual object agnosia, prosopagnosia and achromatopsia. This proposition is based on Damasio s [6] model of how unique personal memories are encoded. stored and recalled. In simplified terms, he postulated that when we experience an event it is stored throughout different regions of the brain as a space and time-locked multimodal memory. We store visual aspects of the event in the visual association cortex, auditory aspects in the auditory association cortex, and tactile aspects in the somatosensory association cortex. Concurrently, an abstract, umodal formula of signals, or binding code , specifying the location of the various unimodal memory stores or templates associated with that event and the way the different aspects of the event are synchronised in space and time is generated in a convergence region of the brain which has rich connections with all the association cortices. Damasio suggests that these convergence regions could be in the limbie structures. including the hippocampus and the anterior sensory cortices. The event may later be recalled via any single-modality aspect of the event, whether it is visual, auditory. tactile, or in some cases simply a smell or taste (see Temporal reconstruction of a multimodal unique personal memory resulting in RECOGNITION OR RECALL Fig. 4. A schematic diagram of the processes and anatomical structures involved in the encoding, slorage. recognition and recall of autobiographical memories, based on Damasio s [6] theory of ume- locked multiregional activation of unique personal memories. this model may explain the loss of autobiographical memories observed in their patient Boswell [8] and in H. M. [5]. It would appear that the binding code is stored bilaterally in homologous convergence areas, as damage in cases of severe autobiographical memory loss is almost always bilateral. Even supposing M. H. does have diffuse bilateral medial temporal damage sufficient to account for his anterograde memory impairment, these lesions do not compare with the density and extent of the lesions found in most other cases of severe retrograde autobiographical amnesia (e. g. Boswell, H. M. ) . While M. H. s occipital lesions would not be expected to disrupt the binding codes that allow access to his autobiographical memories, Damasio s model does provide another way autobiographical memories can be impover- ished or lost. Given that humans are generally very reliant on the visual aspects of their experiences, perhaps the very extensive impairment M. H. has in recalling visual memories of objects, faces. and colours, disallows the possibility of triggering memories of auto- biographical events via the visual memories associated with that event. In addition, autobiographical memories that are triggered via another modality are so impoverished by the loss of the visual components in the reconstructed event memory that they are not recognised by M. H. Even if, for example, M. H. 's recollection of his 21st birthday party could be activated by hearing a tape recording of a speech made at the purty, his reconstruction of the event would 588 JA. Ocprn be so impoverished by not being able to recognise the faces of the people at the party, and his inability to visualise the room it was held in, the presents he received. or the food on the table, that recognition of the event may not occur. Since his accident, M. H. presumably stores new events us space and ume-locked multimodal memories that exclude visual memories, and thus he should be abic to later access and recognise the event via one of his intact modalities. It is feasible that prior to his accident M. H. was particularly skilled at utilising visual imagery to aid memory, and his use of other-modality imagery was relatively weak. In order to memorise events now, he must learn to attend to non-visual aspects of new episodes und associate them in space and time. Certainly, his memory for recent personal events. while impaired, is considerably better than his memory for personal events prior to his accident, and the events he remembers involve smell, taste, and strong emotional reactions. He is also able to recall some recent events when verbally cued, but verbal cucing does not assist him with remote events. In conclusion, though in most subjects visual impuirments and autobiographical memory deficits would be seen as unrelated, given the anatomical location of M. H. s lesions and his pattern of neuropsychological test results, I have postulated that his autobiographical memory loss is a result of his inability to recall long-term visual memories. The smell and sound of motor-bikes evoke non-specific retrograde memories for M-H. . and not particular events that can be confirmed by others. An auditory, tactile or olfactory stimulus has not yet been discovered that is highly specitic to an autobiographical memory [rom M. H. 's past, and that can also be independently confirmed by others. Acknowledgements | would like to thank the June Byham Trust Fund for financing M.

Patients with associative visual object agnosia often demonstrate an inability to recognise the written word (alexia}: however as Farau [14] has shown in a review and re-interpretation of the literature on these disorders, a significant number of cases have associative visual object agnosia and either prosopagnosia or alexia, but not both. The lack of conclusive case studies on patients with object agnosia but without prosopagnosia or alexia led Farau [14] to postulate that two representational systems underlie these three disorders. One is an impairment in the representation of complex parts. This is more likely to be associated with a right (or bilateral) occipital lesion and results in visual object agnosia for objects with complex parts, including faces. The other is an impairment in the representation of numerous parts. This is more likely to be associated with a left (or bilateral) occipital lesion, and results in visual object agnosia for objects with numerous parts, including words. Patients with isolated disorders of cither prosapagniosia or alexia are considered to have mild to moderate impairments of the appropriate underlying representational system, and patients who have one or both of these disorders plus visual object agnosia are considered to have a severe impairment of the underlying representational system (s) . This hypothesis negates the possibility of having visual object agnosia without at least one of the other two disorders. 1 mug spoon 4 spoon 1 spoon toy truck DK. 3 ear or truck flower (daisy) DK. 2 flower banana DK. 2 banana safety-pin clothes peg 2 nappy-pin ash tray 3 ash tray 2 ash tray toy teddy - 3 soft toy teddy orange _ 2 orange feather 3 feather fork | fork tay rabbit 4 bunny can opener _ 2 tin opener artist paint brush _ 1 paint brush sunglasses 2 specs scissors 4 1 scissors pen 3 1 pen paper clip - 3 clip for papers nS *Latencies (sec) ure for correct naming responses only, . g. a 1 sec latency indicates a response time of between 0 and | sec, and a 2 sec latency indicates a response time between | and 2 sec, ete.

For example. seeing a birthday cake might cuc the generation of a visuul image of the subject's own birthday cake from long-term visual memory (ealled the visual memory template in Damasio s model) . This unimodal memory will activate the binding code that as formed in a convergence region at the same time as the visual memory. This in turn will acuvate all the other modal memories stored in different cortices, and associated with the birthday cake memory. in the same space and time-locked sequence that occurred when the event was originally experienced. At this point the subject experiences recall of the event.

Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12- 24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has_ remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and_ personal autobiographical memory have suppor- ted the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. The issues addressed in this paper are threefold. Firstly, the finding of a clinically significant amnesic syndrome in two patients following the apparently uncomplicated trans- callosal removal of colloid cysts from the IIIrd ventricle has obvious practical implica- tions for the management of such cases. '? Secondly, the site of pathology has relevance to the continuing controversy concerning the role of the fornix in human memory. Thirdly, the pattern of memory deficit, with partial recovery of non-verbal anterograde memory and the absence of appreciable retrograde amnesia in either case, addresses the issue of the dissociation of memory processes, parti- cularly the relationship between anterograde and retrograde memory loss in the amnesic syndrome. * Case reports Case one A 45 year old right handed woman, presented in July 1985 with a 12 month history of severe paroxysmal bursting headaches, associated latterly with brief episodes of paraesthesia and weakness affecting the left leg. She had no complaints of memory loss, and had con- tinued working as a clerk and running her house without difficulty. Her family had noted no problems with her memory or other higher cognitive function. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Bedside testing of orientation, attention, memory and language was normal. A CT scan revealed a typical high density non-enhancing colloid cyst situated in the anterior part of the IIIrd ventricle with a mild degree of obstructive hydrocephalus. Surgery was performed in July 1985. A transcallosal approach to the left lateral ven- tricle was used. A 2 cm incision was made in the corpus callosum. The pericallosal arteries were identified and spared. A typical tense colloid cyst was identified embedded in the septum pellucidum which was opened. The cyst was then removed via the left foramen of Munro without apparent damage to the for- nices. There were no operative complications and the patient s recovery in the immediate post-operative period was uneventful. Upon recovery, it was immediately apparent that she had developed an amnesic syndrome with anterograde memory impair- ment so that she was unable to retain simple verbal material (for example, name and address) for more than a few minutes and was disorientated in time. The retrograde amnesia initially covered the last 12 months. For in- stance, she was unable to recall the operation, preceding illness or family events of the past year. Over the next few months, however, the retrograde amnesia gradually decreased to approximately four weeks in duration. Detailed and repeated informal assessment of remote memory, for both personal and public events, from the past two decades has shown consistently excellent performance. Although there has been no improvement in the degree of anterograde memory impair- ment during the two years since her surgery she has adjusted well to the handicap by the extensive use of mnemonic devices, and retains good insight into her memory capacities. In 1986 she returned to work at her former employment but in a sheltered part- time capacity. Formal neuropsychological testing was carried out at one, three, 14 and 24 months post operatively (see below) . A CT scan per- formed following surgery showed an area of low attentuation in the region of the left fornical column (fig la) . A recently obtained MRI brain scan, with contiguous parasagittal T1 weighted images, demonstrated severance of the fornices at the level of the IIIrd ven- tricle directly beneath the deficit in the anterior corpus callosum (fig 2a) . Both scans failed to reveal any abnormalities in other major memory-related structures (that is, the thalamus, the hippocampus and _para- hippocampal regions) . Figure 3 illustrates the normal appearance and course of the fornix in a control subject for comparison. 634 Figure 1 Axial CT scan images in cases 1' (1a) and 2 (1b) at the level of the foramen of Munro showing an area of low attenuation in the region of the left fornical column (arrow) . Figure 2 Sagittal MRI images in cases 1 (2a) through the midline showing interruption of the fornices (arrow) at the level of the foramen of Munro directly beneath the surgical corpus callosum defect. In case 2 (2b) the right fornical column was apparent on contiguous parasagittal cuts, but in the other patient neither column could be demonstrated. Case Two A 33 year old right handed man, presented in May 1987 with a three month history of paroxysmal headaches and a single episode of loss of consciousness. At this time he continued to work as a self-employed salesman without difficulty. His wife had not noticed any impair- ment in his memory. Physical examination revealed no abnor- malities. Bedside testing of attention, orienta- tion, memory, visuospatial function and lan- guage was normal. A CT scan revealed a typical Hodges, Carpenter high density non-enhancing cyst situated in the anterior part of the IIIrd ventricle, approx- imately 1 cm in diameter. There was minimal enlargement of the lateral ventricles. Surgery was performed in May 1987. The cyst was removed by a transcallosal approach to the left lateral ventricle, a technique identical to that used in case 1. A 1 cm incision was made in the corpus callosum. The pericallosal arteries and thalamo-striate vein were identified and spared. The septum pellucidum was then opened and a typical colloid cyst was identified through the foramen of Munro. The cyst was incised and evacuated, the capsule was then dissected away from the forniceal columns and completely removed via the left lateral ven- tricle. There were no complications in the immediate post-operative period. As soon as he had recovered from the procedure it was apparent that he had developed an amnesic syndrome with clinically obvious anterograde memory impairment but temporally limited retrograde memory loss. Initially the retrograde amnesia was of approx- imately 18 months duration; he was unable to recall his operation, presenting complaints or Figure 3 Midline sagittal MRI image in a control subject showing the normal appearance and course of the fornix (arrow) for comparison with the two patients.

Over the next few months, however, the retrograde amnesia gradually shrank to about four weeks. As in the former case, his recall of more remote personal and public events has remained normal on detailed informal testing. The degree of anterograde memory impair- ment, apparent on clinical testing, had not improved substantially when last reviewed 12 months post-surgery. He does, however, retain very good insight into his memory capacities and by the use of extensive written and recor- ded notes has managed to return to work in an office but with a substantial reduction in status and salary. A CT scan performed post-operatively (fig 1b) revealed a lesion in the region of the left anterior column of the fornix, and residual enlargement of the left lateral ventricle. A recently obtained MRI scan, using the same techniques as above, showed interruption of the left fornical column beneath the surgical deficit in the corpus callosum at the level of the Table 2 Results of general intellectual and memory tests in case 2 July 87 Dec 87 August 88 Expected (8 weeks) (6 months) (12 months) Range* 1Q Verbal 112 Performance 114 Full Scale 110 NART' 110 Digits Forward 9 Backward 5 Paragraph Immed 775 10-0 75 10-12 Delayed (60 mins) 0 0-5 0-25 6-7 PALT* Immed 75 40 10-0 16-19 Delayed Easy 4 0 6 6 Hard 0 0 0 34 Warrington RMT?

No other lesions were shown. Results The formal neuropsychological test results on cases 1 and 2 are shown in tables 1 and 2, respectively. The patients scores were com- pared with established normative data for tests in routine clinical usage. For the more experimental tests, normative data were derived from 20 neurologically normal controls subjects, mean (SD) age 54-2 (8-6) , who represent a subgroup of the community-based controls used in a previous study. The results confirmed the presence of an amnesic syndrome which initially affected anterograde verbal and nonverbal memory to an equal degree. In Case 2 there was no significant discrepancy between the estimated level of pre-morbid IQ, as judged by perfor- mance on the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and the post-operative WAIS IQ scores. Case 1 showed a discrepancy between Verbal and Performance IQ of 23 points in favour of the latter, implying a degree of verbal intellectual impairment. A number of additional tests of general cognitive ability (Raven s Advanced Progressive Matrices*) , frontal executive function (trail making, verbal fluency ) , problem solving'! and naming ? revealed no evidence of impairment in either patient (see table 3) . Immediate (short-term) memory for verbal material (digit span) and non-verbal material (Corsi block tapping span) was also normal. Assessment of longer-term verbal memory revealed substantial impairment which has persisted without significant improvement for 24 months in case 1, and for 12 months in case 2: delayed recall of prose passages (logical memory component of the Wechsler Memory Scale WMS) has remained severely impaired as has the ability to learn word pairs on the paired associate learning (PALT) component of the WMS. \" 14 On a modified version of the drilled word list learning test of Weintraub and Mesulam, * using a standard eight word list, both patients required an abnormally large number of learn- ing trials to reach the criterion of three con- secutively correct trials [ (eight and nine trials, respectively; controls 4-8 (1-2) ]. In addition, they demonstrated a rapid rate of forgetting: at five minutes they retained 50% and at 15 minute only 25% of the word list (normal controls retain virtually 100% throughout) . Recognition memory for verbal material appeared to be superior to free recall. On the Warrington Recognition Memory Test (WRMT) , \" case 1 obtained raw word recogni- tion scores at the 25th percentile level, whilst that of case 2 was just above the 10th percentile. In contrast to their performance on tests of verbal memory, both patients showed im- provement on some measures of nonverbal memory during the six to 12 months following surgery. On the supraspan block tapping test, ! initially both failed to reach the criterion of two correct runs after 20 trials. By six months (case 2) and 14 months (case 1) their performances 636 Table 3 Results of the additional neuropsychological tests of frontal executive function and language in cases 1 and 2 Case 1 Case 2 Ravens Advanced Progressive Matices (max = 12) 8 10 Trail Making Test A secs 25 19 B secs 60 45 Verbal Fluency (Letters F, A, S; total) 35 45 Boston Naming Test (max = 60) 52 57 were within the normal range, 8-2 (3-0) . \" Their scores for delayed recall of the Rey- Osterrieth complex figure were initially in the severely impaired range, 6-0 and 7-5. ' By 12 24 months, however, case 1 had improved substantially whilst there was a less marked improvement in the score of case 2. It should be noted that a parallel form of the complex figure was used for alternate test sessions. The pattern of results on the incidental spatial learning test of Smith and Milner revealed a dissociation between recall of item identity and recall of item location. In this test subjects are asked to name 16 toys randomly arranged on a 60 cm board and to estimate the price of the real item represented by the toy (for example, washing machine, watch) . The toys are then removed from the board and after four minutes of distraction the subjects are asked to recall as many items as possible in one minute. They are then given the toys to replace on the board in their original positions. The number of items correctly recalled after four minutes was clearly impaired (four and two items res- pectively; controls 8-5 (1-8) , whereas the mean item displacement was within normal limits, 9-1 and 7-4 cms; controls 7-9 (3-7) cms. Further evidence for the _ selective improvement in case 2 comes from his perfor- mance on the WRMT. At eight weeks post- surgery, his face recognition score was seven points below that for word recognition; however, by six months the face recognition had improved by seven points without any substantial improvement in the word score. Remote memory for public faces and events was assessed using a battery of tests previously described in detail. Since both patients were younger than those for whom the tests were developed, the famous faces and the famous events tests were adapted so that cases 1 and 2 were tested only for items from those decades since they reached adolescence (that is, case 1 late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s; case 2 late 1960s and 1970s) . For both patients naming of famous faces, recognition and dating of famous events was within the normal range for all decades tested. In addition, they were assessed on an ad hoc test of famous face naming, consisting of 35 additional photographs of people who had come to prominence in the Table 4 Performance of cases and controls (spouses) on an ad hoc test of famous faces from the 1970s and 1980s n Case 1 Case 2 Controls 1970s 1715 14 14 1980s 18) = : 17 15 145 Total 35 32 (91-4%) 29 (82: 8%) 28-5 (81-4%) Hodges, Carpenter 1970s (n = 17) and 1980s (n = 18) , using their spouses as controls; in case 1 the overall score (91-4%) was superior to that of her husband (82-8%) and in case 2 (82: 8%) was virtually identical to that of his wife (80%) . It can be seen in table 3 that their performance was equally good for items from both decades. Remote memory for personal events was assessed using the Modified Crovitz Test, in which subjects are asked to generate personal memories evoked by each of 10 nouns (for example, ship, flag, tree) and then to date the memories produced. Each episode is scored for temporal specificity and richness of detail according to the criteria previously described. The patients had no difficulty producing detailed and specific memories, scores case 1: 30, case 2: 29; normal subjects 28-3 (1: 9) . The age distribution of the episodes corresponded to that of normal subjects, who very consistently produce 25% of the memory from the most recent five years: * cases 1 and 2, produced 30% and 40% from this era. Thus the results of the formal tests of remote memory support the clinical impression that neither patient had evidence of a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. Discussion The development of virtually identical neuro- psychological deficits in two patients following the trans-callosal removal of a colloid cyst from the IIIrd ventricle is clearly of practical importance. It is well recognised that patients with colloid cysts in this site may present with a variety of behavioural abnormalities, including memory impairment. Although the two patients in this study did not have formal neuropsychological assessment pre-opera- tively, there was no clinical evidence of memory impairment, and both had continued to lead normal lives until the time of surgery. Whereas, it became immediately apparent fol- lowing the removal of the cysts that they had developed a clinically significant amnesic syn- drome. The conclusion that the memory deficit arose as a complication of the surgical procedure rather than from the colloid cyst per se appears unavoidable. Furthermore, the diagnosis in both cases was made at a relatively early stage since neither had evidence of persistently raised intracranial pressure, nor marked ventricular enlargemient. Colloid cysts of the IIIrd ventricle are notoriously difficult to diagnose since the symp- toms are usually intermittent and can be extremely varied. The advent of CT scanning has revolutionised the ability to detect colloid cysts at an early stage, as shown in our cases. The developments in diagnostic techniques together with advances in neurosurgical tech- nique, notably the use of the operating micro- scope, have also improved the prognosis. ' It is therefore important to note that despite these advances, the removal of lesions from the II Ird ventricle is not without the risk of significant sequelae. The statement by Nitta and Symon that the excision of colloid cysts is now a relatively straightforward procedure with Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of II Ird ventricle colloid cyst minimal morbidity should be modified in this light. A full discussion of the surgical approaches to the IIIrd ventricle is beyond the scope of this article and has been recently reviewed in detail. Briefly summarised, dorsal approaches are now generally favoured for the removal of colloid cysts, either transcortically or trans- callosally. The classic transcortical-transven- tricular approach to the foramen of Munro allows easy identification of the landmarks within the lateral ventricle, but is unsuitable in patients without hydrocephalus and carries the problems inherent in transecting the frontal cortex. The anterior transcallosal approach to the lateral ventricle, as used in our patients, allows good visualisation of both walls of the IIIrd ventricle, is applicable in patients with- out hydrocephalus, but may carry greater risk of forniceal damage. This brings us to the controversy in the literature on the relationship of section of the fornix to memory loss. Sweet et al, in 1959, first drew attention to recent memory loss following bilateral fornix section. Similarly, Cameron and Archibald reported selective amnesia for verbal material after left fornix section, and Carmel included in a larger series two patients with persistent memory impair- ment in whom the right fornix was sectioned to achieve better exposure at the foramen of Munro. The series by Geffen et al* also included a patient with a persistent amnesic syndrome following the transcallosal removal of a IIIrd ventricular colloid cyst; this patient was the only one, of the four reported, to have had bilateral fornical section. Further evidence for the role of the fornix comes from the reports by Heilman and Sypert and by Tucker et al, of amnesic deficits resulting from the destruc- tion of the posterior fornix by invasive tumours in this area, and from the report by Grafman et al of a patient with severe memory impair- ment resulting from a penetrating shrapnel wound that transected the columns of the fornix bilaterally. On the other hand, a number of sur- geons ! *! report sectioning the fornix without causing clinically overt memory problems. Neoplastic destruction of the fornices without memory impairment has also been described. This apparently contradictory and confusing literature was recently reviewed by Garcia- Bengochea and Friedman? who drew attention to the fact that in excess of 150 cases of sterotactic anterior fornicectomy have been performed for the treatment of epilepsy with- out apparent memory loss. Although, as they also point out the possibility cannot be ruled out that memory deficits have gone unnoticed in a number of epilepsy patients, particularly as most were also afflicted by psychiatric distur- bances which may well have precluded formal memory testing. None of the studies claiming a lack of effect of fornix section has included formal neuropsychological assessment. It is well established that damage to the amygdala and hippocampus result in marked impairments in anterograde memory pro- cesses. ? Given that the fornix is a major efferent 637 pathway connecting the hippocampus to the other limbic and diencephalic structures which also play an essential role in human memory it would be surprising if damage to the fornix did not cause memory impairment. In our patients, it seems most likely that one (or both) fornical columns sustained direct or indirect (for example, vascular) injury at the time of surgery. This conclusion is partly speculative since pathological confirmation of the site of damage is not available. In both patients, however, CT scans have demon- strated lesions corresponding to the left for- nical column, and more recently obtained MRI images indicate severance of one or both for- nices. Furthermore, in neither case has damage to other known memory-related structures (that is, the hippocampus, and parahippo- campal region, or the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei) been demonstrated. Damage to these or other cerebral structures cannot be totally excluded by presently available in vivo methods. The discrepancy between Verbal and Performance IQ in case 1 suggests that she may have sustained minor left hemisphere damage in addition to the fornix injury. For our neuropsychological findings, in both cases verbal and nonverbal anterograde memory were initially affected to a similar degree. Over the next three to six months, however, there was substantial improvement in some measures of nonverbal memory without a concomitant improvement in verbal memory. Although the effects of practice may have accounted for some of this increase, especially on recall of the Rey-Osterrieth figure, the considerably improved score in case 2 on the face recognition part of the WRMT and in both patients performance on the supraspan block tapping test cannot easily be explained on this basis. That unilateral damage to the right and left hippocampi selectively impair nonverbal and verbal memory processes is well estab- lished. * Given the site of pathology, the interesting possibility arises that the left fornix carries pathways specialised for verbal memory from the hippocampus to the mammillary bodies. This conclusion is supported by two previous studies: the case reported by Cameron and Archibald in which left fornix section resulted in a selective verbal memory deficit, and the report by Tucker et al, * of a modality specific amnesia in a patient with destruction of the left fornix by an invasive tumour. The other suggested but less definite dis- sociation in both patients is between anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Whereas both patients had a persistent and clinically significant anterograde deficit, neither showed a remote memory deficit of more than a few weeks duration either on detailed informal assess- ment. Furthermore formal tests of remote memory showed normal performance includ- ing an ad hoc test of famous faces from the 1970s and 1980s in which the patients spouses were used as controls. The nature of these tests is such that a very minor degree of retrograde amnesia may not be shown. There was, how- ever, a clinically obvious discrepancy between these two memory components in both cases. 638 The relationship between these components in patients with the amnesic syndrome remains controversial. Bilateral hippocampal ablation results in a profound degree of anterograde amnesia without a temporally extensive retrograde memory loss. By contrast, in dien- cephalic amnesia (as exemplified by Korsakoff s syndrome) there is typically a very extensive retrograde memory impairment extending over many decades. It has been suggested that the extent of retrograde amnesia is directly related to the site of pathology. It would be predicted that fornix damage, with resultant hippocam- pal deafferentation, would result ina temporally retrograde amnesia as was the case in the two patients. Recent evidence, however, casts doubt upon this simple anatomical relation- ship, since temporally extensive retrograde amnesia may be associated with hippocampal pathology and diencephalic amnesia is not invariably associated with an_ extensive retrograde loss. * The absence of a substantial retrograde amnesia cannot easily be explained by the relative mildness of the anterograde deficit since recent studies suggest that there is no direct correlation between the severity of anterograde and retrograde amnesia. * On a practical level it is interesting that both patients have adapted well to their memory deficit. Several possible explanations are sug- gested; firstly, the amnesic disorder appears in both cases to be relatively pure with preser- vation of frontal executive function and of insight. This has enabled them to develop and apply successful mnemonic strategies. Secondly, the apparent sparing of remote memory means that they are able to draw on their pre-operative semantic and episodic memory to a degree which is unusual in amnesic subjects. In conclusion, the two cases we report high- light the fact that persistent anterograde memory impairment may follow the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cysts. More subtle deficits may be commoner than is at present appreciated and further studies are required to answer this question. We thank Professor W B Matthews, Dr Nigel Hyman, Mr P J Teddy and Mr C B T Adams for allowing us to report these patients, Dr Philip Anslow for his neuroradiological expertise, Dr Nagui Antoun for providing the normal MRI image, and Susan Oxbury and Elizabeth Gaffan for their helpful comments on earlier drafts. 1 Carmel PW.

It is a disease which is infectious but not communicable. The germs of tetanus [Clostridium tetani] are extremely hardy, capable of surviving even in the absence of oxygen. They thrive in the manure of domesticated livestock and therefore in the pastures that provide fodder for cattle. The tetanus germ is able to subsist for years as inactive spores intermixed in the top soil of pastureland. But when, for example, fragments of muddied clothing [bearing tetanus spores] are thrust into the body following battle wounds, the tetanus spores become acti- vated, multiply and produce an exotoxin [called tetanospas- min], a nerve poison which is then carried by nerve fibers and the blood stream to the remainder of the body thus affecting the connections between motor nerves. This chemical distur- bance of the junction between nerve endings causes intense and painful muscle spasms called tetany. The jaw muscles con- tract, for example, producing a phenomenon called lockjaw. Difficulties in swallowing and even breathing arise, followed by lability in both blood pressure and body temperature. The muscle spasms are unyielding and may result in severe arching of the trunk. If untreated, death generally ensues within days. Tetanus infection is such a common complication of battle- field wounds that members of the military in most armies are routinely depressive symptoms by screening at well- child visits.

Chen, MD, Vlad Zayas, MD, and Richard Gold, MD A 72 year-old right handed woman with long-standing poorly-controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hyperten- sion, and coronary artery disease presented with weakness and numbness of the right arm. She had significant memory defi- cits and was oriented to self only. Her long term memory was intact, but she was unable to learn any new information. She also had psychomotor retardation, mild right facial droop, right arm weakness, dyssynergia and numbness. The remain- der of her neurologic examination was unremarkable. MRI of the brain (Figure 1: diffusion-weighted image with re- stricted diffusion in the region of the fornix) revealed an acute infarction of the fornix. Follow-up imaging showed con- trast-enhancement of the infarcted fornix. (Figure 2: Post- contrast T1 MRI) . From neuroanatomic studies and studies of patients with bilateral forniceal injury following surgical resection of colloid cysts, the fornix was established as a key structure in memory formation. The fornix is one of the structures involved in memory and emotion formation called the Papez circuit an the limbic lobe. It serves as an efferent tract connecting the hippocampus with the diencephalic nuclei including the mam- millary bodies. The anterior cerebral and pericallosal arteries provide the blood supply to the fornix. Patients with bilateral and unilateral forniceal damage exhibit anterograde amnesia with greater impairment in learning tasks of recall than in rec- ognition. However, most of the cases reported in publishe cases were bilateral.

Probably the most common one is proactive. When I hear someone, always the head of some organi- zation, say the word, | interpret it to mean, something bad is going to happen and I don t have a clue as to how we'll respond. I will not cite examples since most readers are as familiar with this as I am. I have a gut response to the use of impacted as a verb, as in, his lack of health insurance impacted his medical care. The first time I recall seeing was in quotes from Alexander Haig, a former head of West Point, who became is use an advisor to Henry Kissinger during the Viet Nam war, and then secretary o} For many years, I thought that his a constructions on how well the Viet Nam state. hasic war was going, presaged a left temporal brain tumor. Since he s still alive, no more aphasic than before, I acknowledge my error, still wondering if his fluent agrammatisms and empty content were acquired on purpose, or the result of a brain injury. He used the word impacted frequently. I believe it was not an accepted use of the word at the time but now is. As a personal whim but also to improve qual- ity, the word impacted cannot be used as the past tense in this journal except to describe severe constipation. The topic of this commentary, how- ever, is The Mission Statement. Unlike im- pacted which makes my heart race a little, mission statement , like proactive, makes my eyelids droop. I have been to a few meetings, including retreats in which groups of very smart people debated the statement describing the principles their organization stood for, and how best to state them. In my experience, the debates were always about the presentation and little about the principles, and were usu- ally about as useful as proactive planning. This came to mind recently when I received an unsolicite American Association o! e-mail from the University Profes- sors containing a debate on the value of the TTY os mission statement, triggering this commen- tary. They included one piece in favor, one against and one that was a satire, so pre- sumably one for and two against. The ar- gument in support of the mission statement was strong: institutions were set up with specific missions and that as societies change one must use the mission statement as the backbone for establishing priorities. New ventures must be considered in light of the goals of the institution. New administrators, in particular, needed to follow the man- dates, as The opposing view held that a mis- sion statement for that author's univer- aid out in the mission statement. sity department, a non-science field, was intended solely to produce a rubric for judging faculty. The mission statement ollow certain guidelines that would allow product, certain objec- was to tively measurable achievements, to be es- tablished. How could one measure love of literature, increased appreciation for poetry or art, or an actual work of cre- ative expression? The author considered that particular use of the mission state- ment a pseudo-scientific perversion. The satire focused on the usual ele- ments of political correctness, what goals could be deemed culturally biased, what were the implications of prioritizing goals, and such like issues. collected a few mission statements from medical groups and was surprised to find that most were very reasonable, even exemplary presentations of principles. One hospital states that its mission is to provide the best care it can. A university medical department states that its mission is to pro- vide the best training it can. The mission of academic clinical de- partments is not so clear cut, especially in a time of financial constraints. Clinical de- partments are devoted to providing the best care possible, the best teaching possible and the best research possible. Some might in- clude outreach missions to the needy, or international bridging. The problem of the mission statement is where to place the 6 emphasis. No one would sacrifice clinical care, yet it is an unlikely scenario that any clinical department would choose a well funded researcher who rarely saw patients in favor of an excellent clinician who never published papers for the one slot available. The justification would be that others with clinical expertise can cover for the weaker clinician, that the money brought in would help the clinical and teaching effort and that this researcher would bring cutting edge knowledge into the department. So, if the mission statement calls for the hig] est standards of clinical expertise, teaching and research we may or may not interpret this to be the order of priorities. After all, there may be three equally important goals, ut only one can be placed first in a sen- tence. The question then becomes how mal- leable the three are, and, can a department, wholly focused on clinical care and teach- ing, forgoing research, claim to be fulfill- ing its mission? When money is tight, as it as been for the last two decades, constraints dictate the choices. Which is why I have a great deal of skepticism about the impor- tance of mission statements other than to lay out very broad principles that are often obvious. For example, a research institute in New Haven only does research on neurodegenerative diseases. They see pa- tients only in the context of research stud- ies. They do no teaching. Their mission is research, clinical and basic. The NIH clini- cal arm does research and training. They treat patients only if they enter a protocol. Teaching hospital departments also may have such well-defined missions. Many teaching hospitals provide clinical care and teaching and have no intention of perform- ing research. Staff who want to do research may pursue it as a hobby, as do those in private practice. As money has dried up in medical research, it seems clear to me that uni- versity hospital clinical departments have become more reliant on clinical dollars (which are also drying up) , with less time devoted to research and education. The MEDICINE & HEALTH/ RHODE ISLAND mission statements haven t changed but the constraints have. Departments have evolved new names for the roles of their faculty, and old rules mandating that a certain minimum percentage of faculty had to be on the research track have gone by the board in favor of a pragmatic approach that allows the department to stay alive and deliver care and teaching. The mission statements haven't changed, but the mission has. Staying alive has become the underlying theme for many departments. Missions are im- portant and departments should know what they are. Mission statements need to be flexible yet not limiting, and hope- fully, reflective of the actual mission. Too often they are more PR than guiding prin- ciples, not worth the effort taken to cre- ate them. JosrrH H.

This edict was not prompted by any imminent threat of hook- worm disease [typically transmitted via bare feet] or of an alien virus, heretofore unknown, that thrives in new-mown grass and endangers the lives of those foolhardy enough to expose their toes. No, the warning was issued because of the extremely re- mote threat of stepping on a rusty nail contaminated with teta- nus germs. No actual cases were cited. There always seems to be someone to take the simple, pas- toral joys out of life, to deny humanity certain inalienable plea- sures. For a constricted civilization confined to their shoes, ties, beliefs and other paraphernalia of uptight prudery, there arises a visceral, indeed atavistic, pleasure in walking barefoot upon a verdant lawn. Imagine if walking barefoot were declared ille- gal except for one day in mid-June, each year. Oh, how citizens would flock to the parks on that joyous day and revel in expe- riencing the tingling of grass upon their naked feet, with no intervening socks or shoes. It is perhaps akin to Emerson's ob- servation: If the stars should appear but one night in a thou- sand years how would man believe and adore. This is not to deny the malign role of the tetanus germs in human history. Admittedly, tetanus infection survives only in a narrow niche of human experience. Unlike the germs that cause great epidemics, it is transmitted neither immunized against tetanus infection. In World War II, amongst 4. 5 million Americans who were wounded in battle, only four cases of tetanus were recorded, a tribute to the mili- tary immunization program. Deep wounds sustained by civilians are routinely treated with surgical debridement and tetanus immunization. Thus, teta- nus infections in nations such as the United States are now rare. During the last decade there have been about 43 cases of tetanus recorded per year in the United States. The great ma- jority have been documented in California, Texas and Florida. The protective effects of childhood vaccination against teta- nus, [a requirement for entrance into the public school system of all 50 states], tend to diminish over the years, thus making the elderly or foreign-born immigrants substantially more sus- ceptible to tetanus infection. Two other groups are particularly vulnerable: Those with diabetes and those chemically depen- dent who employ illicit drugs such as heroin intravenously. In the case of addicts, the germs are introduced by syringe needles which are contaminated with soil. Yet tetanus infection persists elsewhere, particularly as a ma- jor cause of death amongst newborns, especially in southern Asia and Africa. Two traditional factors contribute materially to the presence of tetanus infection in the newborn. First, in many cul- tures, the severing of the newborn s umbilical cord is done ritually by using the father s scythe, thus symbolically reaffirming the pa- ternity of the offspring. Yet another source of contamination is the use of mud packed against the umbilical stump of the newborn to diminish the bleeding, a common maneuver in regions without health centers. In both instances the farming implement and the farmyard mud the likelihood of contamination from teta- nus spores is high. The World Health Organization estimates that VOLUME 91 No. 8 AUGUST 2008 239 240 400, 000 to 600, 000 infants die each year from tetanus infection. A myth prevails in the United States that penetrating wounds caused by rusty nails result in tetanus. It is not the rust but the soil-contamination with tetanus germs that remains the cause. Tetanus infection, for practical purposes, has now become a burden virtually confined to third world nations, and particularly their rural newborn. The New England states have not seen a case of tetanus for over a decade, even amongst its barefoot-in-the- park population. STANLEY M. Aronson, MD Disclosure of Financial Interests Stanley M.

Adashi, MD TTY os Upon my appointment in 2004, Brown s Corporation and Administration tasked me to expand the medical student body (then 60-70 matriculants/year) , codify the piloted Pre-Med application process, design a new integrated medical educa- tion curriculum, rank in the top quartile of US medical schools, grow the biology program, expand the Public Health Program and locate it in a new facility, reconstitute the divisional leader- ship team and establish an academic medical center with Brown s teaching hospital partners. The latter was to include the activa- tion of the Brown-Hospital Partnerships, the establishment of a Medical Scl definition o! ool facility off of College Hill as well as the joint and investment in Brown-Hospital Centers of Research Excellence. At this time thanks purely to the hard work of many in our midst and to a newly reconstituted divisional leadership of that agenda has either been accomplished or is underway. Some elements of this vision remain to be realized and will require ongoing investment by future administrations. team muc! The MD class of 2011, ninety six strong, is our largest ever. Pre-Med matriculants (~1% of ~3, 000 applicants/year) - now a regular component of the student body are scholasti- cally indistinguishable from Ivy peers. A new and integrated pre-clinical curriculum replete with a novel two year-long Doctoring course and an innovative Scholarly Concentration Program - is poised to explore its clinical component. A rise of 12 rungs in the US News & World Report research rankings over the last four years now ties Brown s Medical School with its counterparts at Dartmouth College and the University of Iowa while outranking 75% of all accredited US medical schools. With the recruitment of 27 new faculty into the Biology and Public Health Programs via the Plan for Academic En- richment and with several faculty searches still underway, a campus-based roster of 110 tenure track scientists/scholars (a 40% increase since 2004) is within reach. Further, with the Public Health Program in its own home (an 11-story building at 121 South Main St. purchased in 2005) replete with an expanded faculty body and newly developed educational of- ferings, an accredited school status can now be explored. Fi- nally, with the recruitment of 4 new departmental chairs and with several additional such searches poised to be launched, the ongoing renewal of the academic leadership is well in progress. Although a physically distinct, programmatically coordi- nated academic medical center remains to be fully realized, palpable progress to this end is evident through the activation of the Brown-Hospital Partnerships, formulation of a Dean s Strategic Plan, establishment of regular channels of communi- cation, improvement of the tenor of the conversation, joint re- cruitment of officers for both strategic planning and enter- prise-wide research, alignment of Brown-Hospital recruitment protocols for chairs of clinical departments, and the progres- sive centralization of intellectual property efforts. Moreover, ongoing discussions with Brown's Hospital partners give rise to the hope of establishing an academic medical center complete with a vigorous Brown-Hospital research alliance, one that will complement a successful extant educational partnership. Most importantly, the vote of confidence afforded by the War- ren Alpert Foundation s $100 million gift has assured that the establishment of a Medical School facility off College Hill and that investments in Brown-Hospital Centers of Research Ex- cellence are now in the realm of reality. We did not stop there. With accreditation of the Medical School secure through 2013, re-designed and improved medical student advising, upgraded physical facilities, expanded compensation for pre- clinical teaching faculty, expanded summer research assistant- ships, improved US Medical Licensing Examination test scores, strong residency matching record, implementation of three new combined degree programs (MD/MPH, MD/MPP and MD/ MPA) , the introduction of online admission (Banner ) and student/faculty assessment (OASIS ) systems, increasingly paperless faculty affairs office, improved outreach to alumni, a strategic communication and marketing plan, substantially in- creased total endowment (to $327 million; an 80% increase since 2004) , a growing financial aid endowment (to $72 mil- lion; a 50% increase since 2004) , an ambitious annual fund, growing balanced budgets (to $130 million; a 60% increase since 2004) , the introduction of the national AOA honor soci- ety, 2 new endowed chairs committed to ongoing innovation in medical education and a new medical education building in the planning phases, Brown s newly named Alpert Medical School is soundly positioned for further progress. Similarly, the inauguration of the Sidney E. Frank Hall for Life Sciences as well as the renovation of the research space within the Biomedical Center facility, continued Brown's trans- MEDICINE & HEALTH/ RHODE ISLAND formation in the life sciences. The establishment of an office for Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, the introduction of competitive graduate student stipends, the doubling of pre- doctoral training grant and fellowship support (from 44 to 88 positions) , the implementation of the Marine Biological Labo- ratory partnership, the recruitment of new faculty, the marked improvement of faculty compensation and the addition of new research space, have all converged to enhance the divisional scientific training environment. Moreover, the garnering by faculty of signature program project and center awards (e. g. National Children s Study) along with the prospect of an in- stitutional Clinical and Translational Science Award have given Brown s biomedical enterprise a growing critical mass of large (often > $10 million) cross-disciplinary inter-institutional investigative initiatives (12% year-to-date increase over last year in peer-reviewed grant dollars awarded) . Complemented by a newly established Investigator Bridge Fund, 9 newly added/appointed endowed chairs, the Excel- lence in Women s Health Seed Grant Program, the Dean's Award for the Advancement of Women Faculty, the launching of the Center for Restorative and Regenerative Medicine, the AIDS Center, the Vision Research Center, the Bio-repository component of an anticipated Personalized Medicine Program, a planned Brown-wide Global Health Program and a proposed Correctional Medicine Program, an already vibrant intellec- tual enterprise is now on the move. Although much has been accomplished, many challenges remain. Amongst select future tasks I would mention growing the financial aid capacity of the Alpert Medical School, en- dowing and expanding its MD/PhD Program, redesigning the Clinical Curriculum, enhancing faculty diversity, creating a Brown-Hospital Research Alliance, achieving consensus on joint Brown-Hospital centers of excellence, striving for program- matic coordination commensurate with an Academic Medical Center, working towards increasing the wet lab research space, working towards greater support of graduate training, secur- ing a CTSA Award, and working towards the accreditation of the Brown School for Public Health. I appreciated the opportunity to have made a difference. To all who have played such an important role in advancing this enterprise of ours, I express my deepest gratitude and ap- preciation. Eli Y. Adashi, MD, was Dean of the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University from 2004-8.

Gruppuso, MD, Eileen Palenchar and Janice Viticonte On May 25, 2008, 70 men and women received the Doctor of Medicine degree from The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, representing the 34th class of physicians graduated from our institution since 1975. Of the 2, 484 previous graduates, approximately 328 (13%) are licensed to practice in Rhode Island. This article introduces the gradu- ates of the MD Class of 2008 to the phy- sician community in our state. A Portrait oF THE CLASS OF 2008 Of the 70 graduates, forty-two were women (60%) and 28 were men (40%) . The racial/ethnic composition of the class (Table 1) shows a similar proportion of students from Caucasian American back- grounds (46%) as the previous year (48%) . Sixteen percent of the graduates are members of minority groups underrepresented in medicine (7 African Americans, 3 Mexican American, and 1 mainland Puerto Rican) as defined by the Association of American Medical Col- leges (AAMC) . This number represents a slightly proportion of underrepresented minority students than the 19% underrepresented minority stu- dents reported for last year s graduates. The proportion of students from underrepresented groups among all stu- e Alpert Medical School at present (combined for the four years) is 14%, although this determination does not take into account the 32 students (9%) who chose Prefer not to respond when asked to indicate their ethnicity on their medical school application. Twelve of our most recent graduates are residents of Rhode Island. They came from ten communities: two students from Pawtucket, two from Cranston, and one student each from Barrington, Bristol, Cumberland, Lincoln, Providence, Slocum, Wakefield and Warwick. Stu- dents graduated from Bishop Hendricken, Cranston High West, Lin- coln School and Lincoln High School, Moses Brown, Mount St. Charles, St. lower dents at t TTY os George s School, Shea, South Kingstown, Toll Gate, and Tolman high schools. The largest proportion of students in the MD Class of 2008 comes from the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) : 29 graduates (41%) . The medical school has special agreements with post baccalaureate pre- medical programs at Bryn Mawr College, Goucher and Columbia University that were established shortly after the PLME was inaugurated. Students from these programs decided upon a career in medi- cine only after completing college. Typi- cally, they have been engaged in other or several years following college. The goals in establishing this route of admission were to maintain a rich diver- sity in the student body by admitting stu- dents who were older and who had dif- ferent academic and life experiences, and to round out the total class size to com- pensate for the expected attrition from the PLME. Fifteen members (21%) of the class were post baccalaureate students, careers nine from Bryn Mawr College, four from Goucher and two from Columbia Uni- their undergraduate colleges. Of the re- maining graduates, two entered medical school through the MD/PhD program, two through advanced transfer and two through the Brown Avenue route by which Brown undergraduate students have been brought to the medical school. The recently implemented standard pre- med route will produce its first gradu- ates in 2009. Brown University was the most com- mon undergraduate college among the graduates, accounting for 32 graduates. Tougaloo came second with four mem- bers, then Harvard, Middlebury, Provi- dence College, Rhode Island College and the University of Rhode Island, each with two members from the Class of 2008. The most common undergraduate major (40%) was biology (including sub- disciplines such as biochemistry, life sci- ence, neuroscience, and microbiology) . Science majors taken together (including math, engineering and psychology) ac- counted for 61% of all majors, while 29% of majors were in the humanities and 10% in the social sciences.

Specialty Choices for Warren Alpert Medical School Classes of 2004-2008 most common choice, while psychology occurred during the previous five years. was the most popular choice among those During those years, the percentage of our majoring in the social sciences.

The actual number of graduates who will eventually practice primary care after completing their graduate medical education will be smaller than the 50% reported here. Based on previous data from the AAMC that tracked graduates, we estimate that approximately one third of our graduates will actually practice primary care. The specialty choices for all mem- bers of the Class of 2008 are given in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1. As has been the case in previous years, our most recent graduates chose to pursue training in general surgery at a rate lower than the national average (7. 1% versus 9. 8%) while opting for surgical special- ties at nearly twice the national average (11. 4% versus 6. 7%) . Similarly, our stu- dents are moving on to so-called institu- tional specialties (anesthesiology, pathol- ogy, rehabilitation medicine, radiology and radiation oncology) at a rate that is more than twice the national figure (12. 9% versus 7. 1%) . Table 3 lists the residency destina- tions of the Class of 2008 graduates. Of the 70 graduates, 68 are entering resi- dency training next year. Two are delay- ing their residencies. Eleven graduates matched with Brown-affiliated residency programs and will be staying in Rhode Island. California is the most popular Where Tey Are Goine Primary Care Internal medicine remained the 51% most frequently selected specialty (13 graduates) .

Where Graduates are Going for PGY1 Residency ConcLusion As has been true in previous years, the proportion of Alpert Medical Schoo graduates entering primary care residen- cies closely approximates the national data for all US medical school seniors. Resi- dency choices of our graduates indicate a continued trend towards surgical spe- cialties and institutional specialty disci- plines. In the aggregate, our graduates continue to compete successfully for highly competitive graduate training pro- grams. REFERENCES 1.

Shield, PhD, Terrie Fox Wetle, PhD, and Richard W. Besdine, MD Old age is the most unexpected of all the things that happen to a man. Leon Trotsky (Lev Davidovich Bronstein) , Diary in Exile, 1935 When current medical students begin residencies, the first baby boomers will reach Medicare eligibility (1/1/2010) . The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University has seized this demo- graphic certainty to ensure that its graduates, regardless of medical specialty, know how to care for older adults. The redesign of the medical school curriculum in academic year 2006-2007, previously described in Medicine & Health/ Rhode Island, provided an ideal time to launch an ambitious program to teach principles and content of geriatrics to all students. When the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation awarded a $2 million, 4-year grant to Brown in July 2006, the essence of the proposed project was captured in the slogan, Geriatrics for every student, Targets were medical students, residents in multiple spe- cialties and faculty development. As the me every course, every year. ical school has streamlined its pre- clerkship courses by integrating physiol- ogy, pathophysiology, pharmacology and pathology in each of the organ blocks, aging content is integrated as appropri- No longer are age and disease tacitly and inextricably linked; the distinction between normal aging and pathology is explicitly taught. ate. Reynolds has awarded 30 curricu- lum grants to US medical schools since 2001. In the project s two years at Brown, we have accomplished the follow- ing initiatives. Pre-CLerksHip Courses Pre-clerkship courses were the first priority. Faculty geriatricians and ad- vanced fellows on the Reynolds team identified essential geriatrics content that could be added to the syllabus of each raibespaaec course, in synchrony with the goals of each course director, section leader and lecturer. Geriatrics faculty provided de- tailed content outlines, cases for small group learning and PowerPoint slides. Understanding that students focus on tests, exam questions (>150 to date) test- ing knowledge of the aging-related con- tent were constructed and many were used. We increased aging-related content for 1 year students from <6 hours to >45 hours, and for 2\"4 year students from 16 to 46 hours. The Anatomy Lab Comes Alive Anatomy is a highlight. Death cer- tificate data on the 24 ca 2006-7 academic year revealed that the mean age at death was 80. 5, and the lavers of the median was 86. Causes of death and co- morbid conditions illustrated our nation s most prevalent causes of morbidity and mortality, which were discussed with the students in the context of their own ca- davers. Geriatricians led a walk the tables lab session, discussing the aging and disease findings in each cadaver. In their first semester of medical school, stu- dents learned that their cadavers illus- trated complex medical problems repre- sentative of the living patients they were about to encounter in clinical settings. Scholarly Concentrations (SCs) Another highlight of the curricu- lum redesign has been the SCs program, previously described in Medicine & Health/Rhode Island. Students identify an area of interest from among the 10 SCs, and together with a mentor, de- velop a project. In the first year, 6 MD2010 students chose the SC-Aging. Concentrators are assigned a volunteer community-dwelling Elder Guide, with whom they develop a social relation- ship in monthly visits. Each year, con- centrators participate in group field trips and small group sessions, and at- tend many of the core lectures in the Geriatrics Summer Series. The projects of the first class of con- centrators are diverse. Difu Wu (mentor, RW Besdine) prepared >40 aging-related content outlines for the 1 year Integrated Brain Sciences course; these materials are the basis for a geriatric neurology text he and geriatrics and neurology faculty are writing. Amy Hsu (mentor, J Teno) stud- ied feeding tube insertion rates for end- stage dementia patients across hospitals, and presented a poster at the American Geriatrics Society meeting. lan Buchanan (mentor, RW Besdine) , who has been awarded an NIH Howard Hughes Schol- arship, created a web-based interactive curriculum on transitions in care. Ronen 4\" year medical students to ascertain perceptions and knowledge of end-of-life care (men- tors, R Shield, N Long) . Robert Velasco (mentor, P Pirraglia) assessed ris Stein conducted focus groups wit factors for success of pulmonary rehabilitation for older veterans with chronic pulmonary disease; he presented a poster at the Ameri- can Thoracic Society meeting. Virtual Patients Web-based learning has been integral to self-directed study. Geriatricians worked with former Dean for Medical Education Stephen Smith to develop interactive me- dia cases of older patients. In a longitudi- nal multi-year case, an elderly woman falls, has serious sequelae and subsequent co- morbid conditions. Epidemiological con- text, screening tests and treatment are part of this lively DVD, which also features sev- eral ol ler patients who recount their falls. Doctoring - The Longitudinal Relationship For the two-year Doctoring course, geriatrician Naomi McMackin paired students with consenting residents in as- sisted living facilities (ALFs) . During this year-long relationship, students prac- ticed their physical exam and interview- ing skills, learning how to discuss sensi- tive issues such as end-of-life care. VOLUME 91 No. 8 AUGUST 2008 247 248 CLERKSHIPS All clerkships but pediatrics have explicit mandatory clinical exposures to older patients, enriched by multiple small group discussion cases. The newly inte- grated surgery case features an elderly woman presenting with diverticulitis; themes include uncommon symptoms and functional loss, exposing students to clinical situations in which aging affects evaluation and management. In 2008, a new clerkship focus is proceeding in tandem with the curricu- lum redesign. In the traditional appren- tice model of medical training, individual clerkships had little communication, re- sulting in duplication and overlap. In the reorganization of the clerkships, the Reynolds contribution is to identify broad clerkship themes; candidate themes are germane to aging, but not exclusively geriatrics topics. End-of-Life Theme The Reynolds Clerkship Advisory Group is creating an end-of-life theme to be implemented across clerkships. The core didactic content and clinical experi- ences related to end- of-life care will be taught, as decided by each clerkship s lead- ership. The family medicine clerkship will include content about delivering bad news; in the experiential component stu- dents will participate in a patient conver- sation about advanced directives in the outpatient setting. In surgery, students will learn about informed consent, including temporary suspensions of DNR/DNI sta- tus for surgery. The students will witness a patient discussion regarding informed con- sent for surgery. In psychiatry, students will learn about grief, bereavement, failed grieving and the assessment of suicide risk; in the experiential component students will assess a suicidal patient for safety. RESIDENCIES Residencies in Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Psychiatry and OB-GYN have been en- riched. All internal medicine residents have a mandatory 1-month geriatrics block in year 1, consisting of non-hospi- tal clinical experiences, a 10-session di- dactic series and work on a personal project. Many residents rotate through the geriatrics teaching service (GTS) , caring for Geriatrics Practice in-patients; geriatrics faculty are attendings, and fel- lows rotate as well. Emergency Medicine residents run 8 geriatrics cases, developed by EM faculty using high fidelity man- nequins in the Rhode Island Hospital Simulation Center. The first EM geriat- rics fellow began a 2-year academic pro- gram in 2006. Half the EM interns ro- tate on the GTS. Family medicine resi- dents have a 3-year continuity experience in geriatrics, including nursing home (NH) care, case discussions, didactics and most recently the deployment of an elec- tronic medical record in the NH. Psy- chiatry, with its own academically ori- ented 2-year geriatrics fellowship, has an extensive resident curriculum. OB-GYN residents have clinical experiences in ge- riatric gynecology and uro-gynecology, reinforced by 5 annual lectures on prin- ciples and practice of care for older pa- tients. Some interns rotate on the GTS. EpucarionAL RESOURCES IN Acine (ERA) The Brown Reynolds Project launched the ERA website in fall 2007. Created by medical students Sareh Rajaee and Joanne Chiu, the site houses all ag- ing-related materials created at Brown (>100 elements) . Using the MyCourses rogram, a webspace tool for all Brown University courses, a generic username and assword allows access for non-Brown us- ers. Files are organized for students, resi- dents, faculty and general audiences. The For Students folder includes aging syl- abi on the organ systems, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) cases for clerkships, and slide sets for courses. The For Residents folder includes cases for residents in each specialty, and supporting slide sets. The For Faculty folder, accessible only by Brown faculty, stores exam questions and other sensitive information. The General Resources section houses many slide sets, relevant articles and web resources. The site is featured on the POGOe (Portal of Geriatric Online Education) website, a Reynolds Foundation inventory of aging- related products, and is accessible through the Brown Library s and Geron- tology Center s homepages. Facu. ty DEVELOPMENT Two initiatives target practicing phy- sicians, especially those who mentor and teach medical students. Facilitator guides. Physicians and so- cial scientists in lectures and small groups teach Doctoring students interviewing, physical examination and professionalism. The additional aging-related content and the longitudinal ALF experience are ac- companied by written facilitator guides for the instructor teams to use with stu- dents. Facilitator guides include practic- ing the geriatrics interview, end-of-life decision-making, sexual and geriatrics vital signs. Geriatrics for the Practicing Physician. As readers of this Journal know, a column on care of older patients has been a regu- lar feature since January 2007, supported by Quality Partners of RI. Topics covered history-taking include avoiding and managing poly- pharmacy, falls, transitional care, elder abuse and mistreatment, hypoactive de- lirium and NH feeding tube decisions. Edited by Ana Tuya Fulton, MD, and written by Brown geriatricians and geri- atrics fellows, the column alerts physicians to frequently encountered problems in older patients. EvaLuaTion Each component of the Reynolds project is being evaluated. Two strate- gies, the Dose and Journaling initia- tives, are innovative. Geriatrics Dose Determining how much geriatrics content is delivered to students is complex. In collaboration with course directors, lec- turers began to integrate new aging con- tent into the pre-clerkship curriculum. Beyond documenting these additions, we assessed the students perceptions of the amount and quality of the aging-related content. Several volunteers ( trackers ) from the 1\" and 2\" year classes were re- cruited to report on geriatrics content in every lecture, lab and small group. Via tracking sheets, students documented the minutes of aging content, level of integra- tion, and other evaluative comments. From these reports, interesting defi- nitional issues arose. If aging content were truly successfully integrated, the student might not identify it as aging content (i. e. , stealth geriatrics ) . Moreover, stu- dents may not define aging tradition- ally; for example, and much to the evalua- tors surprise, a 47-year-old patient was described as geriatric. Student com- MEDICINE & HEALTH/ RHODE ISLAND ments have included suggestions for im- provement. For example, a student, prais- ing a lecture on dementia, suggested cau- sation be better explained. Such feedback can spur mid-course corrections. Course directors and instructors are also asked to report on the aging content, cases and exam questions included in their courses. Journaling What are your experiences, reactions, and insights related to the geriatrics con- tent you have received in your medical school courses? This question is posed weekly to medical student volunteers in the journaling project. A second question asks for student responses to older patients encountered that week. In some weeks, a third question is added, tailored to that week s curricular topics. In personal, thoughtful, and sometimes moving ac- counts of their insights, misgivings and musings, students explore their notions about becoming physicians and what it means to care for older patients. In these essays and in the debriefing thank you lunches held at semester end, students have shared their perceptions about the project s value, as well as our efforts to integrate geriatrics. A qualita- tive analysis team of two geriatricians, a medical anthropologist, a gerontologist and a health services researcher is analyz- ing the journals. These journals reveal shared meanings that provide clues to how students respond to their courses, what they think it means to be a physi- cian, and how they may care for older patients after they graduate.

Rougas, Jack C. Rusley, Beverly R. Young, Carmelle V. Romain, Jason V. Lambrese, Richard Dollase, EdD, Alicia D. Monroe, MD, and Dale A. Ritter, PhD In restructuring the preclinical curriculum at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, we have focused equally on integrating basic science instruction and on providing students with essential clinical skills. To improve our students clinical competence, we introduced Doc- toring, a two-year course that involves stu- dents developing clinical skills in didactic and small-group sessions led by physicians and social and behavioral science teach- In addition, students practice com- munication, history-taking and physical ers. examination skills in physicians offices and other clinical settings such as emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics. In redesigning our pre-clinical cur- riculum, we, like other medical schools, faced logistical hurdles; e. g. , finding ad- equate resources and sufficient one-on- one teaching time. The lack of direct fac- ulty observation of medical students in the busy office practice or hospital set- ting has been noted. Yet, such one- on-one observation is critical for medical students until they have mastered their skills. One possible solution, the use of non-faculty teaching associates, has proven a viable alternative to strictly fac- ulty-based teaching of clinical skills. The role of medical students as non- faculty teaching associates has not been adequately described, though their effi- cacy as teachers in the clinical years has been well documented. The premise of peer-assisted learning is that students can help other students learn, while deriving some benefit for themselves. One key reason cited for the effectiveness of the near-peer model is the cognitive congru- ence of near-peer teachers with their stu- dents. Up experience to their under-class peers and er class students are close in can empathize with the learner, coach at a level appropriate for the learner, and anticipate and reframe learning. Over the last two years, the Alpert Medical School has created a student- based Teaching Academy that utilizes the experience of second-year students to provide one-on-one feedback and coach- ing to first-year students. TTY os First YEAR: ROLE OF THE TEACHING FeLLow In DoctoriNG year, the Teaching Acad- emy was composed of 28 second-year medical students who coached first-year students in the Doctoring course. Four In the initial fellows served on the Teaching Academy Executive Committee as student coordi- nators. Along with faculty advisors, the stu- dent coordinators supervised the second- year fellows, coordinated with the Doc- toring course leaders, and communicated problems to small-group faculty. The other 24 second-year fellows worked directly with first-year students. Each fellow was assigned to four first-year students and met with these students in pairs for one hour each month. (Figure 1) Review session content focused on hands-on skills and clinical interviewing practice. Fellows were required to attend a series of workshops to ensure their competence as coaches, and were provided with a handbook of cases, clinical vignettes, and skills checklists. At the end of each review session, both fel- lows and first-year students completed a short feedback form to monitor the rogress of each individual in the program. Our evaluation data indicate that sec- ond-year students who coach first-year stu- dents can provide valuable opportunities or enhanced clinical skills practice often absent from standard first-year curricula. Specifically, the first-year student eedback form assessed the usefulness of teaching academy sessions in imparting second year Faculty small grouplesdey 21 Smell Group | Faeuiry mall group leades #2 .

Data have been averaged for all respondents across the fall 2007 semester. Student feedback participation ranged from 58-60% (55-57 reporting) coaching apactatios mat clinical skills. (Figure 2) First-year students rated aspects of their experience ona scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best) , as well as provided written feedback. Comments of first-year students demonstrate special appreciation for sev- eral aspects of the Teaching Academy experience: the additional opportunities to prac- tice clinical skills; the individual on-the-spot feedback they receive; * the specific and practical nature of their peers suggestions; * the ability to organize and integrate the various components of the physi- cal exam and medical interview. As one first-year student remarked, T feel as though I present to the patient as an approachable and naturally empathetic interviewer. I am also pretty lent in the way I organized the dif- ferent components of taking a patient's confi medical history. It allows for a clear and complete interview with transitions that make sense. This is largely thanks to my teaching fellow. Journal reflections from Teaching Academy fellows demonstrated a thoughtful approach to coaching. A teaching fellow said: While I might have my ideas of how to perform a physical exam or how to conduct a good inter- view, being forced to clearly provide feed- back to students allowed me to fully shape my own approach and style. An- other student who just started her core clerkships commented: . . . participating in the Teaching Academy has given me good insight into how to learn effectively during my clerkships. Working with first- years has allowed me to be more mindful of what's involved in teaching in a clini- cal context, and as a result, I feel like I'll be much more efficient when it comes to learning and dealing with feedback from the residents and attendings on my rota- tion. Common concerns for fellows in- cluded some initial uncertainty about their own clinical skills and inadequate familiarity with the evolving first-year curriculum. However, fellows recognized their unique vantage point as peers of the first-year students and took the opportu- nity to provide practical advice. Seconp YEAR: ROLE OF THE TEACHING FeLLow In ANATOMY In the second year of implementation, the Teaching Academy fellows also coached first-year students in the anatomy course. In the first dissection laboratory session, the teaching fellows provided hands-on assis- tance with dissection: the teaching fellows uncovered the cadaver and made the first cut; they provided useful tips on utilizing the scalpels and scissor spread; they intro- duced general dissection techniques. Anatomy examinations consist of both a written portion and a lab portion. In the lab practical exam, students have approximately a minute to identify an anatomical feature on a cadaver. They may be asked to interpret x-rays as well. First-year students also answer conceptual questions that integrate the lecture ma- terial with their laboratory work. In help- ing first-year students prepare for the lab portion, the teaching fellows held a mock practical examination. During the mock practical, the teaching fellows introduced first-year stu- dents to the types of questions they would encounter and discussed test-taking tech- niques. They also helped first-year stu- dents talk through their thought pro- cess in answering the questions. There- after, before each subsequent anatomy exam, the teaching fellows held weekend review sessions going over the materi- als to be covered on the written portion os ee 45 23 | : Searcll cassion performing dissection in the lab, First Lab: Rating of the Fallow's Coaching Figure 3. 72 of 96 first-year students rated the performance of their tellow during the first day of lab as very clfective in anawering their questions and concerns, providing practical advice and learning strategies, and building their confidence in sub Geu renin VOLUME 91 No. 8 AUGUST 2008 253 254 and the anatomical features or concepts to be covered on the practical exam. First-year students reported that the teaching fellows helped them undertake the first day of dissection and prepare for their first practical examination. (Figure 3) First-year students noted that the fel- lows taught them practical how to do things, and how to review/study as you go along, especially how to ID structures and take lab notes. The fellows also provided emotional support they were friendly, reassuring, and gave us confidence. In fact, the first-year students confidence level in terms of feeling able to work in the lab productively rose from a 2. 8 to a 4. 2 (1= not good and 5= very good) af ter the fellows had coached them. The mock practical session evoked similar positive evaluations. The first-year students rated the overall session as a 4. 6 or very good. A first-year student felt that the fellow s testing techniques were very good. Another student thought the fellow s way of reasoning through the questions was helpful. A third student reported that the mock practical was a good simulation of the testing environment. ProGRAM STRENGTHS In terms of both peer coaching in Doctoring and in Anatomy, three themes emerged from first-year student and fel- low feedback: * the benefit of immediate and effec- tive feedback, * the value of extra time to practice, * the creation of a comfortable and open learning environment. Overwhelmingly, first-year students felt comfortable expressing their strengths and weaknesses, because of the smallness of groups and the relationships they es- tablished with their second- year fellows. Students willingness to admit their chal- lenges, coupled with the fact that second- year fellows related to their struggles, re- sulted in more specific and effective feed- back from fellows that is rare in other set- tings. Almost universally, first-year students expressed their appreciation for the op- portunity for more practice and more in- teraction with the teaching fellows. Limitations This program reflects the experience of students at the Alpert Medical School over two years, which may limit the pos- sibility of generalizing from our experi- ence. One factor that may decrease the effectiveness of this successful peer tutor- ing/coaching program is the challenge of coordinating all the faculty and students and ensuring that all parties are deliver- ing a clear, consistent message to first-year students about content, and communi- cating with each other about logistical concerns. Similar to other major curricu- lum innovations involving many faculty and students, this problem can be better managed but never entirely solved. REFERENCES 1. Holmboe ES.

Strawbridge, MD, Margaret Howard, PhD, Patricia Nolan, MD, MPH, and Edward Feller, MD Post-partum depression (PPD) , de- scribing a continuum of depressive symp- toms occurring in the first year after child- birth, has been termed the most under- recognized and under-treated obstetrical complication in America. ! Although as many as 1 in 5 new mothers in Rhode Island (RI) suffer from perinatal depres- sion, the number detected and treated is much smaller. The consequences of un- treated PPD may be severe, potentially impairing infant cognitive and behavioral development, as well as wreaking havoc on the mother and family. Early detection of symptoms and timely intervention can improve outcomes. In RI, we need to increase recogni- tion of PPD among physicians and pa- tients. Current screening practices are inadequate Some, but not all obstetrical providers will screen for mood symptoms at the 6-week post-delivery visit. For many women, depressive problems manifest beyond 6 weeks postpartum. This visit may be the only first-year contact a new mother has with her obstetrician The timing misses the majority of women who may develop symptoms much later in the 1 postpartum year. Pediatric and fam- ily practitioners, who may see a new mother as many as 7 times during her first postpartum year, are an untapped resource. We describe an intervention for primary care providers using a simple screening tool to enhance identification of suffering mothers. BackGRounD Common practice defines the post- partum period as lasting up to one year after childbirth; PPD symptoms may not emerge until 3-6 months after delivery. Complaints include depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, and at least 4 of the following: changes in appetite, weight, sleep, decreased energy, feeling worthless or guilty, difficulty making de- cisions, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Physicians may misinterpret moth- ers symptoms as the baby blues. Expe- TTY os rienced by as many as 50-80% of women, this phenomenon may mimic or mask PPD, but is milder, shorter and gener- ally resolves without treatment. In most cases, the blues peak by day 5 post-de- livery and resolve by day 10. Unlike PPD, the blues do not cause either short or long-term impairment. Baby blues can progress to major depressive episodes in a quarter of cases. The most severe, albeit rare, pregnancy-related syndrome is post- partum psychosis. This psychiatric emer- gency is commonly of acute onset with overt psychotic symptoms within days of delivery. Why Peopiatric PRovipERS? Pediatricians or family physicians may be the only medical providers en- countered routinely and repetitively by mothers during the 1* postpartum year. Obstetricians, the obvious candidates for PPD screening, see mothers usually once at 6 weeks after delivery, commonly be- fore the onset of PPD. A depressed mother is less likely to schedule an ap- pointment for herself than she is to fol- low through on well-baby care. (Table 1) Frequent visits or calls for minor com- plaints rather than well-baby visits, poor adherence to recommendations, frequent in the household. Each factor can impair a child s well-being. Puysician BaRRIERS TO DETECTION Attitudes and behaviors of health professionals may impede PPD diagno- sis. In an anonymous national survey, 508 randomly selected primary care pediatri- cians self-reported their attitudes towards recognition and management of PPD, including confidence in their skills and willingness to implement new strategies to improve care . Only 57% of respon- dents felt it was their responsibility to rec- ognize maternal depression. When ma- ternal depression was suspected, addi- tional assessment was done by a disap- pointingly low 48%; none used a specific screening tool. Major barriers to PPD identification were: [1] lack of time for adequate history (73%) or counseling/ education (70%) ; [2] insufficient train- ing/knowledge to diagnose (64%) ; [3] poor confidence in the ability to diagnose (31%) . Only 27% reported that they would change their practice approach in order to recognize more cases of PPD. An additional impediment is failure to use validated screening instruments. firing and hiring of pediatricians may be clues to PPD. Children s physicians are good candidate to assess PPD. They are trained to consider the impact of family environment on chil- dren. While the mother is not the pediatrician s patient, her depression can have serious conse- quences for her child. Screening for mater- nal depression is com- parable to a pediatri- cian inquiring about smoking or violence Table 1.

The 10- item questionnaire takes fewer than 5 minutes to complete; mothers in the wait- ing room can fill it out; office personnel can score it. (Figure 1) The sensitivity in detecting PPD has been shown to be be- tween 89-100% with a specificity as high as 95 % Detection of PPD increased from 1. 6% to 8. 5% using EPDS vs. rou- tine care. ? Even simpler is a less well-vali- dated 2-question screen endorsed by the US Preventive Task Force (USPTF) to detect adult depression: 1) During the past month, have you often been both- ered by: feeling down, depressed or hopeless? 2) During the past month have you had little interest or pleasure in do- ing things? The sensitivity of this screen is 89-96%, specificity, 51-72%'. T] ter tool was not designed specifically for PPD. An algorithm can be provided for e lat- doctors that contains instructions on scoring and interpreting EPDS screen- ing, and what to do with a positive score. Rep Faces: RECOGNIZING AT-RISK WOMEN Any woman may develop this disor- der after giving birth. Symptoms can be subtle and non-specific even to the trained clinician. Thus, population-based screening is preferred to targeted screen- ing. Understanding risk factors is impor- tant. Physicians must be vigilant when dealing with a mother having any pre- dictors for PPD. (Table 2) Some of the most important are: a history of psychi- atric illness, especially during pregnancy; previous PPD; poor social support includ- ing single marital status; and an infant with a difficult temperament. Physicians must be aware that any post-partum woman can develop PPD; thus, screen- ing should not target only those mothers with risk factors. . . screening should not target only those mothers with risk factors What to do with a positive screen? If the pediatric provider suspects PPD ina new mother, either clinically or y a positive screen , the provider should refer her to her primary provider. The mother s personal physician has a formal relationship with her, knows her medical istory and can assess for other medical conditions with similar manifestations. If a new mother does not have a primary rovider, other resources are available. Emergencies should be referred to a hos- ital or community mental health cen- ter. In Rhode Island, The Women & Infants Day Hospital offers a specialized rogram for moms and pregnant women suffering from depression. Patients or hysicians who have questions regarding a patient with PPD may contact the Day Hospital for information. (Figure 1) Future Directions Awareness and education are key components to improve the recognition and care of PPD.

The RI Maternal Mental Health Coalition is attempting to unite insurers, health care professionals, and psychoso- cial programs to streamline physician ac- cess to statewide resources, to enable the state to manage more cases. Illinois 2004 initiative could serve as a model. The IIli- nois Department of Public Aid created a task force on perinatal care focused on making screening for PPD a component of well child visits. Illinois medicaid pro- gram reimbursed physicians who screened using the EPDS. Physicians were also supplied with: [ (1] a copy of the EPDS and scoring guide; [2] the phone num- ber for a consultation service to speak directly with a psychiatrist regarding the management of patients with PPD; [3] a phone number that provided physicians with local mental health professionals to whom they could refer a woman suffer- ing from PPD; [4] a guide for pharma- cological treatment of PPD. A laminated card has been created for Rhode Island providers to assist in PPD identification. (Figure 1) Conc. usions By encouraging maternal screening using the Edinburgh scale as part of an overall risk-assessment for infants during well-child visits, we can increase the rate of PPD detection in Rhode Island. Pe- diatricians and other primary care pro- viders for newborns are an underutilized resource to detect PPD. If pediatric pro- viders undertake this responsibility, the health care community must provide guidance and support including re- sources, efforts to increase reimburse- ment, referrals and advocacy efforts. In order to combat PPD, identification tools must be available and utilized; physicians must be vigilant in screening efforts. REFERENCES 1. Logsdon, Wisner.

Along with mortality, it has become a key indicator in assessing popu- lation disease burden. HRQOL refers to an individual s per- ception of his/her own physical and mental health and ability to react to factors in his/her physical and social environments. Indicators have been developed to assess multiple dimen- sions of HRQOL. However, using multiple HRQOL indica- tors to assess overall quality of life is cumbersome. We sought to develop summary measures to characterize and quantify HRQOL in Rhode Island s population and to identify groups at greatest risk for compromised HRQOL. MetHops Rhode Island s 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data were used for this analysis. The BRFSS is a state-based telephone survey of randomly selected non-in- stitutionalized adults (ages 18 and older) . The BRFSS moni- tors certain health conditions, access to health care, and be- havioral risks. Funding and methodological specifications for the BRFSS are provided to the states by the Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (CDC) . ? From January through December 2004, the Rhode Island BRFSS conducted 3, 999 interviews with RI adults. Nine questions on RI s 2004 BRFSS mea- by an individual to a set of indicator questions. In our study, there are nine indicators of HRQOL with a total of 512 possible response patterns. The LCR model groups these 512 patterns into a much smaller best fit number of HRQOL classes. The LCR model is specified in two parts: (1) a model for the relationship between the latent classes and the observed indicators; (2) a regression model for the relationship between covariates and latent class membership. Results of the model- ling for the relationship between the latent classes and the ob- served indicators are expressed as: marginal probabilities that tell what proportion of the population is located in each class; and conditional probabilities whic! sponse probabilities of each indicator variable. The regression model for the relationship between covariates and latent class membership examined twelve covariates: age, tell the class-specific re- sex, race/Hispanic ethnicity, income, employment, asthma, dia- betes, obesity, physical disability, smoking, chronic alcohol use, and no leisure physical activity. Results are expressed as odds ratios. This analysis is unique to Rhode Island; no comparable analysis is available for the nation or New England. Table 1.

Table 1 also provides the prevalence of each HRQOL indicator for the population over- all. Class 1, accounting for 76% of the population, was characterized by good physical and mental HRQOL; Class 2 (9% of the population) was characterized as hay- ing physically related poor HRQOL; Class 3 (11%) was characterized as having men- tally related poor HRQOL; and Class 4 (4%) as having both physically and mentally related poor HRQOL. People in Class 1 have low condi- tional probabilities (less than 17%) for each of the indicators of poor HRQOL. Conversely, people in Class 4 have large Table 2.

People with disability have exceptionally high odds ratios for each class of poor HRQOL, e. g. Class 2 OR=21. 43, Class 3 OR=3. 34, Class 4 OR=19. 16. Being unable to work, unem- ployed, having no leisure time physical activity, and having diabetes were asso- ciated significantly with Classes 2 and 4 of poor HRQOL. Current smokers had 1. 93 times the odds of non-smokers of belonging to Class 3, and 3. 26 times the odds of MEDICINE & HEALTH/ RHODE ISLAND non-smokers of belonging to Class 4. Those 65 and older have significantly increased odds for membership in Class 2 compared with younger age groups, but decreased odds for membership in Class 3. The lowest income category had 3. 67 times the odds of the highest income group for membership in Class 4. The odds for any class of poor HRQOL were not significantly increased for race/ethnicity, chronic drinking, or obesity. Discussion There are limitations to our study. The cross-sectional design of the BRFSS means the temporal relationship between classes of poor HRQOL and any of the risk factors cannot be determined. Second, because the BRFSS excludes households without land-line telephones and adults living in institutional settings the proportion of adults with poor HRQOL could be underestimated. Finally, the BRFSS does not assess some con- ditions that may compromise quality of life, such as heart dis- ease or cancer. Using a LCR model we found four distinct classes of HRQOL amongst RI adults and quantified the prevalence of each. The largest class, representing 76% of adults, has good HRQOL; the remaining 24% of adults belong to three smaller classes of poor HRQOL. We identified the demographic char- acteristics, health conditions, and health risks having signifi- cantly increased odds, independent of one another, of being associated with one, two, or all three classes of poor HRQOL. Our results indicate the need for interventions that target both mental and physical health needs among identifiable high-risk subgroups. Targeting interventions towards these groups with poor HRQOL can reduce the burden of poor HRQOL for the RI population overall, and may help reduce the total eco- nomic cost of health care in the state.

Futton, PHD Prescribing for Self and Others Robert S. Crausman, MD, and Bruce McIntyre, JD In 2007 the Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline (BMLD) was notified by the Massachusetts of Registration of a public order regarding a Massachu- held a Rhode Island Boar setts-based academic physician who also license. The Massachusetts Board alleged that this physician was asked by a fellow [trainee] under her supervision to write a prescription for medications to treat symptoms of congestion and sinusitis. The fellow reportedly had recently come from California and had not established primary care locally. The Massachusetts Board concluded that the alleged con- duct would be a violation of the standards of good and ac- cepted medical practice. In order to achieve a fair resolution to this matter the academic physician, without admitting guilt, entered in to a voluntary assurance of discontinuance agree- ment to guarantee that she would maintain a medical record for each patient [under her care] that is adequate to enable the physician to provide proper diagnosis and treatment as re- quired by state regulation. The Rhode Island BMLD has received numerous similar complaints regarding physician prescribing outside the con- text of a legitimate physician-patient relationship. As in Mas- sachusetts this practice can technically constitute unprofessional conduct and be cause for an adverse license action. These com- plaints have frequently involved the treatment of a physician s immediate family member or close personal acquaintance. Most often investigation of these complaints reveals gen- eral ignorance of the prohibitions or a failure to fully consider the ramifications of such inappropriate practice. Expedience and acquiescence to family pressure are also recurrent themes. The opinion of the American Medical Association is that physicians . . . generally should not treat themselves or mem- bers of their immediate families. . . They cite the potential loss of professional objectivity by physicians and potential discom- fort by patients as being very problematic. Of note, they fur- ther state . . . except in emergencies, it is not appropriate for physicians to write prescriptions for controlled substances for themselves or immediate family members. . . ? In 2007 the BMLD endorsed this AMA opinion as a for- mal position statement. It is good medical practice and ac- knowledges an important professional boundary that should not be crossed. Unfortunately the AMA opinion is somewhat ambiguous with its use of the word generally . The Board s prior case-related decisions, however, consistently apply the stan- dard that prescribing should not occur outside of a legitimate physician-patient relationship. Of note, the Board opinion re- garding cross coverage situations is that the physician-patient relationship does exist. In practice, a RI physician will not likely be subject to a Board sanction for the occasional refill authorization or pre- scription of a legend, the pharmacy term for a non-control, medication for self or to a family member. However, chronic medication prescription and any prescription of controls must occur in the context of a physician-patient relationship docu- mented by a genuine medical record. A RI physician must not self-prescribe for control medications under any circum- stances. Although our Board s approach is generally with educa- tion first, in 2007 one physician was suspended from practice for one year after having been found to have fabricated a medi- cal record to justify his treatment of a family member with con- trolled substances? and another voluntarily surrendered his li- cense after having been found to have purchased over 50, 000 Vicodin 10/325 tablets over a two year period for personal use. 4 The Board attempts to clarify the gray areas of practice for RI physicians as they arise in the context of complaint investigation. Position statements of the Board are posted on our website and physicians must review then as a condition of electronic license renewal, thus insuring widespread dis- semination. REFERENCES 1.

Scientific terminology, it is claimed, offers a more precise, more in- flexible meaning to the elements of its vo- cabulary. Yet medical idiom, typically aris- ing from borrowings from Greek and Latin, sometimes offers its own dismay- ing collection of ambiguities. Consider the following Classical roots: The word myelin, from the Greek root, myelos, means marrow [that is, the softer interior of bones. ] The root was employed to define two structurally sepa- rate forms of vertebrate tissue. On the one hand it describes many words per- taining to the spinal cord [eg, poliomy- elitis, myelopathy] and more specifically, the tubular lipoprotein sheath surround- phe paar The Dilemma of Multiple Meanings ing the axons, myelin [and associated chemical names such as sphingomyelin]. On the other hand, it defined soft tissues associated with bone marrow, words such as myelogenous. A Latin word, venter, defines the belly. It gave rise to cognate words such as ven- tral [pertaining to the belly or the body- surface closest to the belly] and ventricle [literally, little belly, but then any defined anatomic cavity whether within the heart or the central nervous system. ] Yet other words related to venter include ventrilo- quism [talking from the stomach], even- tration, ventilate [the expelling of air from a cavity] and event [a breaking forth]. The word, plague, a word describ- ing an epidemic pestilence, is yet another term that has given birth to wor widely different meanings. Plague de- s of scends from a Greek word meaning to strike or to wound and is related to the Greek plagio- meaning oblique, damag- ing or plundering [as in words such as plagiary, the act of kidnapping. The En- glish word, plagiarism, comes from the same Greek source, meaning literary plundering. ] The same Greek word evolves into plegia, an English root meaning to strike down or paralyze, as in words such as hemiplegia or diplegia. Its Latin equivalent is plagere, to strike or la- ment [as in words such as plangent, apo- plexy and complain. ] There are yet other clusters of medi- cal terms that reflect the linguist s inad- equate information of human anatomy or physiology and serve, etymologically, to confuse - words such as calcification, calcium, calculate, calculus.

Dr. Da Costa was under orders from the Sur- geon General of the US Navy to address this society. Formerly a civilian, he urged members to consider the career of Navy surgeon. The Honorable S. H. Davis, Westerly, in The American Flag, noted: As I approached your attractive new building [106 Francis St. ] this afternoon, I saw floating from its staff the most beautiful banner that was ever unfurled over any build- ing, state or country. He anticipated the day when a million American mothers sons will carry Old Glory through the streets of Berlin. The author repeated the rumor that Germans were castrating American prisoners. Men, if that is true, this war should not end, the American flag should not be furled as a war flag until every man in Germany shall be castrated, until his seed has banished from the earth. The author praised the contributions of American physicians, citing a Red Cross hos- pital in France that treated 46, 000 soldiers for gas gangrene. Every one of these cases would have been fatal without treat- ment, and there was less than 400 out of 46, 000 lost. An Editorial, The State s Care of the Mentally Sick, la- mented the poor care often given for mental illness. The man with a sick body was gladly received into a hospital for general diseases. The man with a sick mind was a perplexing problem he was sent more often than not to a jail. It was inhuman and irrational, of course, but it was a practice born of the conviction that somehow the mentally sick man was not in the same cat- egory with other sick men. The Editorial called the construc- tion of the hospital for the mentally sick beside the prison at the Howard complex an initial error You cannot mix the medical and penal problems and get anything but confusion. In a Presidential Address, Dr. John Champlin, Westerly, said that the war had kindled . . . patriotic fire in every man, woman and child in this country. Today the blood of every American tingles with pride at the first strain of the Star Spangled Banner. In Child Care, the US Department of Labor Bulletin noted that one-third of men examined for military service in the first draft were found to have physical defects which ren- dered them unfit. Many of these defects might have been over- come if they had been recognized and dealt with in early child- hood. . .

        "case_report": "Ne chology 1997, Vol. 11, No. 1, 90-103 Copyright 1997 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. 0894-4105/97/$3. 00 Persistent Global Amnesia Following Right Thalamic Stroke: An 11-Year Longitudinal Study Sergio Della Sala University of Aberdeen Hans Spinnler University of Milan Annalena Venneri University of Aberdeen The 11-year longitudinal study of a right-handed male patient, L. C. , who suffered from a severe amnesic syndrome following a softening in the right thalamus, is reported. Memory impairment involving retrograde and long-term anterograde memory, both verbal and spatial, persisted without modification, Investigation revealed some residual implicit learning ability. Positron emission tomography studies in the resting state displayed a bilateral hypometabo- lism of the mesial frontal lobes. Evidence suggests that a lesion confined to the thalamus may not on its own account for severe amnesia; that involvement of other structures is necessary for severe amnesia to appear; and that a functional investigation should always be included in cases of small thalamic lesions before drawing conclusions about the structures responsible for agiven deficit. Spiegel, Wycis, Orchinik, and Freed reported the first evidence of anterograde memory deficits due to thalamic lesions in 1956. These deficits resulted from bilateral stereotaxic thalamotomies that affected the dorsomedial nuclei and the mammillo thalamic tracts and caused tran- sient amnesia. Since then, isolated memory disorders as a consequence of bilateral thalamic lesions have been reported several times, and thalamic amnesia is now a well-defined anatomoclinical syndrome (Parkin & Leng, 1993; Signoret & Goldenberg, 1986) . The availability of neuroimaging techniques (Graff- Radford, Eslinger, Damasio, & Yamada, 1984) gave strength to the notion of amnesia resulting from thalamic lesions only (see, for a review, Markowitsch, 1982; Rousseaux et al. , 1986) . Support for the relationship between memory disor- ders and damage to the medial thalamus was also suggested by evidence of bilateral lesions in the dorsomedial nuclei Sergio Della Sala, Department of Psychology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland; Hans Spinnler.

This neuropathological evidence, in conjunction with several reports of patients with focal lesions in the medial thalamus suffering from memory disorders, supports the idea that damage to this area may cause amnesia. However, involvement of cortical structures (e. g. , temporal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and small parts of the prefrontal cortex) and of other subcortical nuclei or white matter tracts was also found in the majority of those cases (Markowitsch, 1982) . Our own case study provides evidence supporting these findings. As far as unilateral lesions are concerned, a few cases manifesting material specific deficits verbal memory disor- ders following a unilateral left thalamic lesion (Brown, Kieran, & Patel, 1989; Hankey & Stewart-Wynne, 1988; Rousseaux, Cabaret, Benaim, & Steinling, 1995; Sodeyama, Tamaki, & Sugishita, 1995; Speedie & Heilman, 1982) as well as spatial memory disorders due to a unilateral right thalamic lesion (Pepin & Auray-Pepin, 1993; Speedie & Heilman, 1983) have also been reported. However, the purity of the Speedie and Heilman (1982, 1983) cases has been disputed by Brown et al. because of coexisting psychopathology. Whether a lesion limited to the dorsal paramedial region of the thalamus is capable of causing amnesia is, thus, a hotly debated issue (Brown et al. , 1989; Kritchevsky, Graff-Radford, & Damasio, 1987; Mair, Warrington, & Weiskrantz, 1979) . Widespread bilateral nerve cell loss and gliosis of the mammillary bodies associated with damage to the dorsomedial nuclei and pulvinar (Victor et al. , 1971) have been observed in neuropathological studies of the brain of patients with memory disorders due to alcoholic Korsa- kov syndrome (Butters & Cermak, 1980; Gamper, 1928) . Those observations suggested that lesions of the dorsome- RIGHT THALAMIC GLOBAL AMNESIA 91 dial thalamic nuclei may be necessary but not sufficient to cause amnesia, and only destruction of both these nuclei, associated with lesion of the mammillary bodies (Mair et al. , 1979) or other areas, might cause permanent amnesia (Brown et al. , 1989; Kapur, Thompson, Cook, Lang, & Brice, 1996) . Support for this hypothesis comes from cases of patients with lesions limited to the dorsomedial nuclei, both unilateral and bilateral, who did not show evidence of amnesia (Castaigne et al. , 1981; Kritchevsky et al. , 1987; Von Cramon, Hebel, & Schuri, 1985) . In all of these cases, the mammillo thalamic tracts were spared. Kritchevsky et al. provided two alternative explanations for the absence of amnesia in their patients: Either the dorsomedial nucleus was not damaged sufficiently to cause amnesia of, more controversially, damage to other structures, such as the mammillo thalamic tracts or the anterior nuclei, is neces- sary to produce amnesia related to thalamic lesions. A patient with global amnesia following unilateral ante- rior right thalamic lesion has been reported by Rousseaux, Kassiotis, Signoret, Cabaret, and Petit (1991) . In addition to memory deficits, Rousseaux et al, s (1991) patient showed moderate impairment on attention and categorization tasks, pointing to a concomitant frontal involvement resulting in executive disability. A further case of memory disorders affecting both verbal and spatial domains, following a lesion confined to the right thalamus, has been described by Foglia, Perini, and Vanzulli (1991) . Amnesia in this case was transient, and the patient recovered fully after 3 months. None of the case studies to date suggest incontrovertibly that lesions involving only the thalamic nuclei can cause amne- sia. We now report evidence from a patient, L. C. , with an isolated right thalamic softening, whose memory deficit results in a non material-specific pure amnesia, steady over 11 years. His performance will be discussed focusing on neuroimaging findings and his residual implicit learning capacity. Case Report L. C. is a bright, 72-year-old, retired man with 18 years of formal education. He is completely right-handed (100% right-handed on the Olfield, 1971, enquiry) and without left-handed relatives, At the age of 60, when he was still an active engineer, he experienced an ischemic attack. At the time of the stroke, he had a 3-year history of chronic hypertension but no alcoholic habits, head traumas, or any other general or neurological disease in his medical records. One morning, when he was getting up, his relatives noticed that he was confused: He asked again and again the same trivial question, forgetting the answer within a few minutes. His speech was slightly slurred, and he complained about dizziness. When he entered the hospital, internistic and neurological examinations were unremarkable and no impair- ment of alertness was detected. L. C. s disorientation in time and space was grossly apparent and began to fade only 20 days later. However, he was aware of having these difficul- ties in orientation. In the first days, he gave varying accounts of the onset of his confusion and he shifted over the course of a few minutes from the awareness of being in the hospital (without knowing for how long he had been there) to reliving genuine autobiographical events of several decades before (e. g. , his staying in a prison camp in India during World War IL) . His disorientation was obviously related to his almost complete failure in every performance of ongoing memory. L. C, never confabulated, however, and he never tried to provide false stories to fill in memory gaps and, at this stage, appeared only superficially concerned about being in a hospital. Over the course of a couple of weeks, he became fully cooperative. After the first few days, L. C. recognized his wife and children without hesitation, and about 20 days later, he seemed to have admittedly with fecurring uncertainties -some recollection of individual nurses and doctors. He did not seem to be fully aware (although a formal assessment of his awareness was never carried out) of his memory disorders, and he was never depressed. An electroencephalogram showed bilateral, syn- chronous slowing. Neuroradiological Findings Several computerized tomography (CT) scans, with and without contrast enhancement, were performed over the ll-year period. These always detected only one ischemic lesion, confined to the dorsomedial region of the right thalamus (see Figure 1A and B) . In May 1983, L. C. underwent a traditional selective angiography exploration, which showed no abnormalities. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was then per- formed in 1985, 2 years after the onset. Sagittal T1 weighted (T1w) plus axial and coronal proton density images were obtained. The spin echo techniques were used to obtain T2 weighted (T2w) images in coronal and axial planes. Axial images were obtained parallel to the inferior orbito-meatal line and coronal images at an angle of 90 to the axial sections. The images confirmed a small lesion confined near the dorsal paramedial region of the right thalamus (see Figure 2) . No alterations were detected either in cortical or subcortical areas; in particular, there was no lesion of the forebrain structures. A first [!*F) fluro deoxy glucose (FDG) PET study was performed at the Hammersmith Hospital in London in 1988. On this occasion, the functional study evidenced only a right thalamic hypometabolism. A subsequent [!8F]FDG PET study performed at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan in 1990, using a more powerful scanner and a more advanced analysis technique, confirmed the presence of right thalamic hypometabolism and detected bilateral hypometabolism in the mesial frontal areas (see Figure 3) . Neuropsycholagical Assessment While L. C. was still in the hospital, a preliminary evaluation of his cognitive abilities was carried out. This revealed a severe isolated amnesia. His cognitive function- ing was assessed by means of the Wechsler Belleyue Intelligence Scale, on which he achieved a full scale 1Q of 113; his verbal IQ was 114, and his performance IQ was 112. 92 DELLA SALA, SPINNLER, AND VENNERI FRONT RIGHT Figure I.

Magnetic resonance imaging detecting a small lesion (L) confined to the vicinity of the dorsal paramedial region of the right thalamus, not detectable at lower and higher levels. His memory disorders were persistent and affected hisev- eryday life severely (e. g. , he would forget that he had just eaten, and he frequently repeated himself) . Because of the persistence and severity of his memory disorders, he was referred to our outpatient clinic in Milan, where a formal neuropsychological examination was carried out 7 weeks after the onset of the disorders. L. C. was fully cooperative, slightly aware of some memory disorders, and constantly confused in time and space, but with preserved knowledge of his personal iden- tity. A slight impairment on the orientation of cues about his family setup was observed. No episodes of reduplicative paramnesia were observed. L. C. was assessed on general cognitive ability tasks as well as on memory tasks (see Tables 1 and 2) . General Cognitive Functioning Intelligence and abstract reasoning. L. C. s abilities were assessed by means of verbal and nonverbal tests. He achieved a score within the normal range on Raven s Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1938; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and on Weigl s Sorting Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) . His performance fell within the normal range also on Elithorn s Perceptual Maze (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and on the Verbal Judgments Task (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) ; this latter task requires a participant to provide interpretation for proverbs or to tell the difference between two words (i. e. , child -dwarf) . In most of the instances, L. C. s scores were close to the median score of the control group (see Table 1 for comparison between L. C. s scores and cutoff values) . Attention, L. C. s attentional capacity was assessed by means of three tasks. His age education corrected scores on the Digit Cancellation test (Della Sala, Laiacona, Spinnler, & Ubezio, 1992) and on Gottschaldt s Hidden Figures (Capitani, Della Sala, Lucchelli, Soave, & Spinnler, 1988) were well above the median scores of the normal reference population. His performance was above the median score on the Reversal Learning (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) , a task requiring a participant to learn two gestures in the pretest phase and to produce the reversal of the examiner s presenta- tion, in a random sequence, during the test phase. Language and praxis. No language disturbances were detected. L. C. scored normally on the Token Test (De Renzi & Vignolo, 1962) . His praxis was evaluated by means of the Ideomotor Apraxia Test (De Renzi, Motti, & Nichelli, 1980) , and his performance was at ceiling with both hands. A summary of L. C. s psychometric profile on tests assessing general cognitive abilities is given in Table 1. Memory Functioning L. C. performed normally on all short-term memory tasks, both verbal (Digit Span; Orsini et al. , 1987; and Bisyllabic Word Span; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) and spatial span (Corsi Block Visuo-Spatial Span; Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) . However, L. C. failed on all long-term episodic memory tasks (see Table 2) . His scores indicated a severe dysfunc- 94 DELLA SALA, SPINNLER, AND VENNERI Figure 3. 18F IFDG PET HSR MILANO 117047930 (8F]FDG PET study performed in Milan in 1990 showing a right thalamic hypometabo- lism and presence of hypometabolism in the mesial frontal areas bilaterally. tion, when compared with age and education peers, on first, Prose Memory, a task requiring free recall of a short story after auditory presentation (Capitani, Della Sala, Laiacona, Marchetti, & Spinnler, 1994) , and second, in long-term storage on the Supra-Span Verbal Learning, according to Buschke-Fuld s (1974) procedure, in which a list of 10 unrelated words need to be learned within 18 trials (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) . The same pattern of severe impairment was detected on Supra-Span Spatial Learning (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) , in which L. C. was required to learn a random sequence of eight of the nine blocks of the Corsi Block test. L. C. s semantic memory appeared to be well preserved: He achieved an adjusted score within the normal range on a verbal fluency task with semantic cues (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987) . He could perform crosswords skillfully. In everyday life, he had no hesitation with comprehension of nonverbal signals, such as road signals, or recognition of forms, such as those for telegrams. L. C. s procedural memory, that is, memory for previously acquired abilities, such as driving a car and handling electrical equipment, was preserved. During the testing, several episodes revealed that L. C. s memory loss also affected retrograde memory, for both public and autobiographical events, L. C. could deal with an autobiographical memory task only by means of his seman- tic memory, providing logically appropriate responses for some situations, but for others, sometimes referring to plausible events that never happened. When he could recollect the events, his description was poor in detail. In his recall of public events, the diachronic sequence of events was much more impaired than the recollection of events themselves. To sum up, L. C. s neuropsychological profile evidenced performance in the. top range of the normal distribution, except for long-term memory tasks in both the verbal and spatial domains. Because of this profound impairment, remote and autobiographical aspects of his memory were formally investigated. Remote Memory Memory for autobiographical information. L. C. s auto- biographical recollection was extensively assessed twice, in 1986 and in 1991, 3 and 8 years after the first neuropsycho- logical assessment. On both occasions, he was tested on a formal standardized questionnaire (Borrini, Dall Ora, Della Sala, Marinelli, & Spinnler, 1989) .

It includes five questions for each period, with a score ranging from 0 to 15 for each period (the overall range of the Autobiographical Memory Inquiry scores is 0-45) . L. C. s age-education adjusted score on this test on both occasions evidenced a severe deficit, mainly affecting in- fancy and late adulthood, in which few events were recol- lected; L. C. achieved better performance for questions that referred to his early adulthood period (16 to 41 years) . In 1991, an informal questionnaire (devised with his daughter s help) , including 20 questions about specific events of his life that had happened after the onset of his memory deficits (from 1983 to 1990) , was also adminis- tered. L. C. s performance on this informal questionnaire showed a recollection of some events (16/20) , proving that he was somehow able to store new material, but in referring to those events, he showed some uncertainty and poor control of specific details. L. C. s wife was assessed by means of the same questionnaire as a control participant. She performed flawlessly and identified all of the events with a detailed description. In spontaneous retrieval of episodes, L. C. presented a temporal distortion in locating personal information: Where no temporal constraints were present, as in everyday life, he identified many episodes as having happened during World. War I, when he was a prisoner of war in India. This behavior was not detected in formal testing when strong temporal cues were provided, by which he could make relative time comparison between questions, but only in informal situations when his recollection was free from any temporal constraint. Nichelli, 1980. Pathological score (below the inferential 5% of Memory for public events. The Italian Questionnaire for Public Events (Costa, De Renzi, & Faglioni, 1989) was used to assess L. C. s remote memory. This questionnaire in- cludes 80 questions for the period ranging from 1966 to 1985. L. C. s age-education -corrected score was 37. 99, below the cutoff score (41. 53) established in 106 healthy participants. To assess his memory for public events that had happened since he had been suffering from the memory deficit, an 83-question questionnaire was prepared, includ- ing public events from 1983 to 1990, chosen from the most significant events (national and international) that had been in the news in that period. Both L. C. and his wife were tested, achieving 61% and 75% correct answers, respec- tively. No norms are available for this questionnaire, as only the performance of L. C. s wife was used for comparison; however, the results of this public events questionnaire, coupled with the similar results of the autobiographical quesionnaire, seem to suggest that L. C. has a residual capacity of learning, although in both cases, events were reported with some hesitancy and scanty detail. Implicit and Procedural Memory L. C. was also tested on the following tasks with the intention of assessing his residual implicit learning capacity. Learning a mathematical rule. L. C. was administered the Fibonacci series. Six lists, each including five numbers, were administered for seven trials. The first two numbers of each list were successive single digit numbers. The remain- ing three numbers were generated following one of the Fibonacci inductive rules, in a way that each represented the sum of the preceding two numbers.

Then he was shown the third number and asked to guess the fourth, and after that he was asked to guess the last number. He was tested three times (Day 1, Day 2, and Day 8) . During the first session, L. C. learned the rule on the fifth trial; in the second session, he learned the rule on the fourth trial; and in the last session, he learned the rule on the first trial. L. . s performance showed that he had learned the Fibonacci rule without any difficulty. It is worth noting that during the second and third sessions, L. C. did not show any sign of remembering that he had already been tested on thar task. : Mirror-tracing test. The mirror-tracing test included a device and a procedure similar to that proposed by Milner (1966) , the same as that used by Nichelli, Bahmanian- Behbahani, Gentilini, and Vecchi (1988) . The patient had to trace the outline of a geometric figure with a stylus without directly seeing his hand but receiving a visual feedback through a mirror reflecting both the geometric figure and his hand. The mirror was placed at right angles to the drawing, and the outline size was 8 mm. This device was connected to a timer and a counter, allowing recording of execution time and errors. Throughout seven sessions, L. C. was asked to trace first a triangle and then a square. Each item was repeated 5 times for each session, but L. C. had no recollection of having been tested on the task from one session to another. To distinguish acquired skills in general mirror-tracing technique from the ability in mirror-tracing a specific geometric figure, on Day 8, he was asked to trace the Test from Capitani, Della Sala, Logie, & Spinnler, 1992. *Test from Novelli, Papagno, est from Costa, De Renzi, & Spinnler, 1989. Test from Borrini, Dall Ora, Della Sala, Marinelli, triangle, first with the same orientation as in the previous sessions (base down) and then with a different orientation, flipped vertically (base up) . Figure 4 shows L. C. s perfor- mance on the first and the eighth day in tracing a triangle. It is clear from Figure 4 that L. C. was very fast and accurate in tracing the practiced geometric figure (base-down triangle) . The Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a significant difference when execution time of the base-down triangle was compared in the first and last sessions (2 = 2. 023, p = . 04) ; a significant difference was also detected when execution time was compared on mirror-tracing a square (new geometric figure) in the first session and the base-down triangle (practiced geometric figure) in the last session, Z = 2. 023, p = . 04. No difference was found between the execution time of a new geometric figure in the first session (a square) and execution time of a new geometric figure in the last session (a base-up triangle) , Z = ~0, 944, ns. The execution time of the base-down triangle in the first session did not differ from execution time of the base-up triangle in the last session, Z = ~1. 753, ms, but this latter was significantly different from execution time of the base-down triangle in the last session, Z = 2. 023, p = . 04. Comparing the performance of the first and the last session, we found that L. C. seemed to have acquired abilities in mirror-tracing that were specific for the item to which he had previously been exposed, rather than a general proficiency in mirror- tracing per se, and those abilities did not generalize to new geometric figures.

The graphic sequence shows comparison of execution time in the first and eighth sessions for old and new geometric figures on the mirror-tracing task. Mirror-reading of words. The task of mirror-reading words included 260 low-frequency words according to the dictionary of frequency of the Italian lexicon (Bortolini, Tagliavini, & Zampolli, 1972) , ranging from six to eight letters in length. The words were written on cards and presented by mirror reflection, one at a time, by means of a tachistoscope. The task of the patient consisted of reading aloud each word and pressing a button when finished. The patient had to read five blocks of 20 words, including 10 words that were common to all blocks (repeated words) and 10 new words for each block (nonrepeated words) . L. , C. s ability to learn the rules and procedure required for mirror-reading and the ability to benefit from frequent repetition of some of the words (50% of stimuli) was then evaluated. The procedure used was a variation of that devised by Cohen and Squire (1980) , who presented triads of words (not single words) . An analysis was carried out to ascertain whether L. C. showed any sign of saving in reading time for repeated words compared with new words during the sessions. When comparing reading times in the first session with reading times in the last session, a significant decrease in time was observed for mirror-reading repeated. words, Z = 2. 803, p = . 005. No difference was present in the case of nonrepeated words, Z = 0. 051, ns. Table 3 Table 3 L.

The remarkable reduction in reading time of repeated words shown by L. C. supports the idea that he was benefiting from previous presentations, saving time consis- tently in reading those items. This behavior cannot be explained simply by the fact that L. C. was acquiring ability in the mirror-reading task, because in this case a more generalized improvement in mirror-reading skills would have been observed. A possible explanation can be found in assuming that L. C. had implicitly learned the repeated words, although he did not manifest recollection of any previous testing session on this task, and an explanation of its procedure was necessary at the beginning of each session. Puzzle task. L. C. s behavior while attempting to solve two different jigsaw puzzles, representing a bus and a locomotive, was observed for eight consecutive sessions. From one session to the next, the patient did not find the jigsaw puzzles familiar, and in each session he claimed that he had never seen them before. In the eighth session, L. C. was asked to solve one of the jigsaw puzzles that he had been trained with (bus) and a new one (a truck) . L. C. did not show any benefit from the training, and no difference was detected comparing his execution time for the jigsaw puzzle used during the training (bus) in the first session with execution time in the last session, Z = 1. 214, ns. No difference was present between execution. time on the practiced jigsaw puzzle and execution time on the new one, Z= 1. 753, ns. Motor skill task. LL. C. s motor skills were assessed by means of a manual dexterity task (Della Sala, Di Lorenzo, Giordano, & Spinnler, 1986) , He was made to screw eight nuts (18 mm external diameter) onto an 18-cm long bolt, using only the coordinated movements of his index finger and the thumb of his right (preferred) hand. The task was 98 DELLA SALA, SPINNLER, AND VENNERI repeated for five consecutive trials for eight sessions, and the score was the average time required to complete the task for each trial. In comparing his mean execution time on the five trials included in the first session with the execution time on the five trials of the eighth session, we found a significant decrease in execution time, Z = 2, 023, p = . 04, which showed that L. C. was benefiting from the training in the task and was acquiring ability in performing it. Once again, L. C. did not seem aware that he had been tested on that task several times: Each time he behaved as if the task was completely new to him. Summing up, L. C. showed implicit learning ability in all but the puzzle task, in contrast with complete lack of recollection from one session to the next. Assessment of L. C. s memory revealed two main findings: severe impair- ment affecting both retrograde and anterograde memory and relatively spared implicit learning ability. Longitudinal Investigation L. C. has been monitored regularly over 11 years with psychometric testing (see Tables 1 and 2) . Gradually, he reached complete awareness of his memory disorders, and he started complaining about his forgetfulness. Furthermore, he became aware of the poor efficacy of mnemonic tech- niques he devised, such as making knots in handerchiefs, taking notes in booklets, and putting the same things (e. g. , keys) always in the same place. As shown in Table 1, in comparing his scores across all examinations, on general cognitive ability tests, we found that L. C. s performance remained unchanged and that he shawed high level achievements. His memory assessment showed an unmodified profile, with normal short-term memory but stable, profoundly impaired long-term memory. Slight changes in scores on some tests, such as the Prose Memory, were observed. Practice effect, the fact that scores on this test reflect a hierarchical scoring system, and a larger age correction or all of these variables together--may account for what might superficially appear as an improve- ment. However, whatever reason may account for this, even his best scores denoted a very poor achievement, being below the 10th percentile of the performance of the normal reference population. Amnesia greatly affected his everyday life, and evidence of this could be found in many circumstances, both in experimental and everyday settings. Often he told the same joke repeatedly. He answered the same question several times in the same way, forgetting that he had already been asked that question. On one occasion, we invited L. C. to a restaurant for lunch, where he ate a complete meal. When back at the hospital, he was invited out for lunch again. He did not show any surprise at this and agreed. When at the restaurant, he ate for the second time a complete three- course meal. In response to a third invitation, he still did not show any sign of remembering that he had already eaten a complete meal twice. However, this time he refused, stating that he was not very hungry. Samples of similar behavior were also found in his everyday life, as when his beloved dog died. Despite his great affection for the dog, he did not remember anything about its having died, and for a long time he went on asking about the dog each time he entered his home. Every time he was told that the dog had died, he experienced a new great sorrow. This behavior strongly resembles that reported about H. M. , the patient described by Scoville and Milner (1957) , who became amnesic after bilateral temporal lobectomy and who was upset by his uncle s death each time he was told about it and always manifested the same strong emotional participation. L. C. s sexual life was also affected by his memory deficit. He could not remember having sexual intercourse with his wife, and when he asked her for it, telling him that this had happened some minutes before was enough to make him stop asking, even when his wife was not telling him the truth. Discussion L. C. suffered from severe amnesia after an isolated right thalamic lesion. This is a unique case, and several aspects offer the opportunity for discussion. Anatomo Correlative Aspects Evidence from a ['*F]FDG PET study (Szelies et al. , 1991) carried out to investigate functional effects of various unilateral and bilateral thalamic lesions on the metabolism of other morphologically intact cerebral structures showed that glucose metabolism in cases of unilateral lesion was significantly lower in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarction. Ipsilateral decrease in cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in the frontal cortex has been fairly recently reported in the positron emission tomography (PET) study of an amnesic patient with left thalamic lesion (Okada et al. , 1991) . Different findings, however, were reported by Rousseaux et al, (1991) , wha observed reduction in blood flow bilaterally in the frontal cortices as recorded by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in their amnesic patient with right thalamic lesion. Furthermore, a functional PET study of a group of 11 pure amnesic patients (Fazio et al. , 1992) reported a significantly lower bilateral degree of metabolic activity in a large number of interconnected cerebral areas, such as hippocampal formation, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and frontal basal cortex, in the amnesic patients, compared with healthy participants, even in those cases in which the structural damage was limited to a unilateral thalamic lesion. Evidence from L. C showing bilateral hypometabolism in the mesial frontal regions, but only a small unilateral structural lesion in the right thalamus supports the idea of bilateral functional sequelae arising from even small unilat- eral lesions. More specifically, as far as amnesia is con- cermed, results of Fazio et al. s study seem to support the hypothesis that damage to a large number of structures is necessary to cause amnesia. In discussing their findings, Fazio et al. maintained that bilateral metabolic reduction of the whole neural network correlated with amnesia (p. 355) was also detected in cases in which morphological RIGHT THALAMIC GLOBAL AMNESIA 99 studies such as CT or MRI showed only a selective and unilateral structural damage. Questions on the effects of thalamic damage on memory were first raised by Brown ct al. (1989) , who suggested the necessity of acquiring information about functional neuronal activity, in addition to an anatomical description of the lesion, to understand the role that abnormalities in neuronal activity outside of the thalamus play in amnesia associated with thalamic damage. The key issue here is that caution is necessary in the interpretation and theoretical speculation about deficits arising from small thalamic lesions when no data from a functional investigation are available. With reference to amnesia, these views are in line with the general issue, within the field of the neuroanatomy of memory, of whether a single critical lesion can cause amnesia. Several amnesic patients described in the literature present with ample and diffuse lesions. On the other hand, as reported earlier, several cases of amnesia following very localized lesions have been reported, and in most of those instances, all of the structures involved in amnesia were part of the limbic system and, therefore, of that circuit identified by Papez (1937) as the memory circuit. According to Parkin and Leng (1993) , this evidence implies that damage to any structure of this circuit may cause amnesia. A different view is offered by Mishkin (1982) , who, using evidence from studies on animals, proposed the existence of two neuroana- tomically separate circuits within the limbic system: the hippocampal circuit, including hippocampus, subiculum, fornix, mammilary bodies, If this were the case, it would explain the severity of amnesia shown by L. C. and corroborate Mishkin s (1982) idea of two anatomical circuits that must both be lesioned to result in severe amnesia. Surely, this finding, added to Fazio et al. s (1992) data, supports the claim that wider involvement of structures other than the thalamus is needed in cases of severe amnesia. Two distinct anatomic systems are said to account for explicit and implicit memory. Although explicit memory appears to correspond anatomically to the hippocampal diencephalic frontal system, implicit memory is not so well localized but certainly involves other cortical areas (Metcalfe, Mencl, & Cottrell, 1994) . Absence of lesions in other areas of L. C. s brain may account for his residual implicit learning capacity. Neuropsychological Aspects L. C. showed a pure, long-lasting amnesic syndrome as a result of a small softening presumably confined to an area grossly overlapping the dorsal paramedial region of the right thalamus. However, in contrast with what has been reported earlier in cases of right thalamic lesions, L. C. showed a global memory impairment, his deficit affecting verbal as well as visuospatial long-term memory. We know that performance in immediate memory tests usually varies in thalamic amnesia (Parkin & Leng, 1993) , and L. C. showed normal performance on short-term memory tasks, as has been already reported by a large number of studies (Brown et al. , 1989; Teuber, Milner, & Vaughan, 1968; Von Cramon et al. , 1985; Winocur, Oxbury, Roberts, Agnetti, & Davis, 1984) , Instead, his anterograde amnesia was paramount. Furthermore, L. C. did not show any deficit involving cognitive functions other than memory. In contrast, impair- ment on attentional and categorization tasks, in addition to ammesia, was observed by Rousseaux et al. (1991) in their patient with a unilateral right thalamic lesion. The SPECT study in Rousseaux et al. s (1991) case showed bilateral involvement of the frontal lobes, a functional disorder that could perhaps account for the attentional and categorization deficits detected in that patient. Indeed, L. C. s second ('8F]FDG PET study also showed a bilateral involvement of the mesial frontal lobes, possibly involving the cingulate cortex. Assuming the accuracy of PET localization, we could have here an explanation for the presence of global memory impairment (both verbal and spatial) in L. C. However, it is worth noting that no other deficit typically linked to frontomesial damage emerged. For instance, L. C. did not present hyperkinetic signs, such as grasp reflex (Denny-Brown, 1958; Penfield & Welch, 1951) , groping (Adie & Critchley, 1927; Seyffarth & Denny-Brown, 1948) , anarchic hand (Della Sala, Marchetti, & Spinnler, 1994; Goldberg, Mayer, & Toglia, 1981) , or utilization behavior (Brazzelli, Colombo, Della Sala, & Spinnler, 1994; Lher- mitte, 1983) . As a result of his frontal suffering, L. C. might have shown deficits in memory for temporal order, deficits that might have been caused by deficient strategic ability. This hypothesis was not formally tested, but as no sign of strategic deficits was observed during the testing (e. g. during his telling a story or referring to episodes) , this suggests that had it been properly tested, evidence of other 100 DELLA SALA, SPINNLER, AND VENNERI deficits resulting from his frontal dysfunction would have been rather unlikely. L. C. s memory profile, thus, allows us to discuss two main points: first, the contrast between his retrograde and anterograde memory, and second, the contrast between his explicit and implicit learning. Retrograde amnesia. L. C. s retrograde memory was also impaired with a few spared islands of efficient recollec- tion. He did not show a clear-cut temporal gradient. A better performance was, however, detected for events covering the period of his early adulthood. Patients with remote memory impairment in thalamic anterograde amnesia have already been reported both with temporal gradient (Graff-Radford, Tranel, Van Hoesen, & Brandt, 1990; Malamut, Graff- Radford, Chawluk, Grossman, & Gur, 1992; Stuss & Guzman, 1988; Von Cramon et al. , 1985; Winocur et al. , 1984) and without (Graff-Radford et al. , 1984) . These conflicting results could be, at least partly, traced back to the different tools used by different authors. As noted earlier, L. C. s retrograde amnesia was also apparent in the autobiographical domain. In his spontaneous recalling of events, he often distorted their temporal loca- tion. He located events that had occurred in recent years as having occurred during his stay in India as a prisoner of war during World War Il. This behavior was not detected in formal testing, in which clear temporal constraints guided his performance. Similar temporal distortion has also been observed by Hodges and McCarthy (1993) in their patient P. S. Hodges and McCarthy interpreted this behavior as being due to disorder of the thematic retrieval framework. At first glance, L. C. may appear different from Hodges and McCarthy s patient because L. C. did not manifest temporal distortion in his autobiographical recollection whenever clear temporal frameworks were provided by the test. However, Hodges and McCarthy s patient, when further investigated, also manifested a tendency to recover from his delusion when his recollection was guided by temporal cues GW. R. Hodges, personal communication, November 21, 1995) . Autobiographical memory disorders have been observed in some other cases of memory deficits due to thalamic lesions (Barbizet, Degos, Louarn, Nguyen, & Mas, 1981; Lucchelli, Muggia, & Spinnler, 1995) . Three amnesic pa- tients with thalamic lesions studied by Fensore, Lazzarino, Nappo, and Nicolai (1988) , were evaluated on autobiographi- cal memory tasks, but according to Fensore et al. , these 3 patients showed a good level of performance. Three more cases of anterograde amnesia following thalamic lesions but with spared autobiographical memory have been reported by Dall Ora, Della Sala, and Spinnler (1989) . Taken together, these case reports do not rule out the possibility of impair- ment affecting the autobiographical domain after thalamic lesion, but fail to point out which variables underlie this apparent inconsistency. For instance, the extension and location of lesions may account for contrasting observations as well as the fact that lesions in different anatomical areas are responsible for different aspects of amnesia. It has been suggested (Lucchelli et al. , 1995) that whereas lesions confined to the thalamus result in anterograde amnesia, lesions encroaching upon the frontothalamic connections as well may account for the appearance of retrograde amnesia. This claim does not receive support from Hodges and McCarthy (1993) ; their patient manifested both anterograde and retrograde amnesia following a symmetrical bilateral infarction of the dorsomedial nuclei, internal medullary Jamina, and mammillo thalamic tracts. Lucchelli et al. s (1995) patient, G. R. , also showed anterograde and retro- grade amnesia as a consequence of a lesion confined to the left internal capsule and thalamus, but in contrast with other cases, he suddenly recovered from his retrograde amnesia. These findings are in line with Malamut et al. s (1992) observation of their patient M. P. , who also recovered from retrograde amnesia after bilateral thalamic lesion (but here the deficit observed was very mild) . However, some caution is necessary in considering these cases. Only morphological neuroradiological investigations had been carried out, and no data are available with regard to the metabolic brain functioning of these patients. Remote memory impairment affecting the autobiographi- cal domain as well was observed in our patient. Morphologi- cal analysis (CT, MRI) of his lesion demonstrated that this was confined to the dorsomedial area of the right thalamus, but [\"FJFDG PET metabolic study proved the presence of hypometabolism of the mesial part of the frontal lobes. As reported earlier, Fazio et al. (1992) demonstrated that a more widespread impairment may be detected by functional (8F]FDG PET investigation, even when MRI and CT scans of the brain evidence a small and well-confined lesion. In other words, the cases of lesions confined to the thalamus but presenting with autobiographical amnesia could have turned out to be a functional deficit involving a wider area and other structures if a functional study had been carried out. At the very least, because of lack of evidence, this doubt cannot be dispelled. Implicit residual learning abilities. L. C. showed some residual ability of learning. He could report some public and autobiographical events that had happened after his stroke, although hesitantly and with remarkably scanty details. This provides evidence that L. C. could, to a limited extent, store new information. Proof of his much better ability to learn without awareness of doing so can be found in some of the tasks, such as the mirror-tracing, the motor skill, and the mirror-reading, in which he showed acquisition, in spite of denying that he had performed those tasks at other times. L. C. s performance seems to be consistent with that of the patient described by Nichelli et al. (1988) , who showed comparable behavior. L. C. showed, as did Nichelli et al. s patient, some preserved memory abilities, in spite of the severity of his explicit memory impairment. L. C. s perfor- mance on both mirror-reading and mirror-tracing cannot be explained by means of procedural learning, which is usually spared in amnesia. The fact that on both tasks L. C. benefited from repeated items rather than from practicing mirror- reading or mirror-tracing per se, strongly supports the claim that he was showing memory for specific items rather than memory for specific skills. On the ather hand, both L. C. and Nichelli et al. s patient showed a behavior differing from that observed by Cohen and Squire (1980) in their patients. RIGHT THALAMIC GLOBAL AMNESIA 101 Cohen and Squire found spared mirror-reading skill, but impaired memory for specific items. We agree with Nichelli et al. s suggestion that the discrepancy can be due to difference in procedure. Whereas we and Nichelli et al. used single word presentation, Cohen and Squire used triads of unrelated words. With this latter procedure, normal partici- pants could use the first word as a cue to recall the other two, whereas amnesic patients could not benefit from the cuing because they are unable to recall explicit associative links among the words. Recently, a patient with impaired implicit memory after bilateral thalamic lesion has been reported (Haut, Young, Cutlip, Callahan, & Haut, 1995) . Lesion involved the dorsomedial nucleus on the right and the anterior nucleus on the left. However, Haut et al. , in discussing their findings, could not find support for the hypothesis that impairment in implicit memory was the result of the thalamic lesion. They suggested, as an alterna- tive hypothesis, that their patient presented implicit memory impairment as a product of impaired attentional functioning. L. C. was able to acquire and demonstrate knowledge of information acquired after his stroke (e. g. , some memories of public and autobiographical events or memory of specific well-practiced items) , despite his extremely impoverished abilities at new learning. In cases of discrete hippocampal lesions causing moderate amnesia, some residual memory may be observed; more generally, amnesic patients, despite being profoundly amnesic, have faint and uncertain memo- ties of things. In a recent article, Van der Linden, Bredart, Depoorter, and Coyette (1996) reported a patient with profound episodic memory loss who was able to acquire new factual public and personal information. Van der Linden et al. explained this finding as being the result of semantic learning that is extremely efficient in the event of meaning- ful new bits of information. L. C. s amnesia is very severe, but his semantic memory is intact, and it is possible that this may account for his residual learning ability. However, as an alternative interpretation, it may be argued that two compo- nents account for implicit learning: One may be identified as general implicit learning, which is preserved in case of amnesia arising from hippocampal lesion, but seems dam- aged in cases of amnesia due to thalamic lesion, and the other may be labeled as specific implicit learning, which is preserved in cases of thalamic amnesia, but is lost in cases of hippocampal lesions. Evidence from Nichelli et al. s (1988) case and from our case, added to evidence from studies of patients with classical hippocampal amnesia (showing gen- eralized improvement in the practiced technique rather than item-specific advantage) , seems to support this dichotomous interpretation. Persistence of amnesia. LL. C. s severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia, which persisted for the 11 years of the study, offers further consideration for discussion. Lucchelli et al. s (1995) patient completely recovered from his retro- grade amnesia 1 year after onset; however, he still presents with anterograde amnesia, even though his anatomical lesion remained unmodified. L. C. s neuropsychological behavior over 11 years is unchanged and consistent with the behavior observed in H. M. (Scoville & Milner, 1957) , whose amnesia still remained unmodified after more than 25 years (Corkin, 1984) . This evidence leads to possible speculation about recovery from amnesia and the role of the right thalamus. Recovery from thalamic retrograde amnesia is possible, as documented in Lucchelli et al. s article. Recovery from anterograde amnesia has not been docu- mented so far, neither after thalamic lesion nor after hippocampal lesion. The only exception we were able to glean from the literature seems to be the case reported by Foglia et al. (1991) . However, this case is poorly detailed (there might have been presence of oedema that resolved over time) . Although improvement and recovery is possible for other cognitive deficits, such as aphasia or retrograde memory, anterograde amnesia seems to be a deficit from which recovery is unlikely. The explanation could be anatomic. There are anatomical structures, such as language areas, whose functions can be taken over after lesion, at least partly, by vicarious structures. In contrast, there are other anatomical structures, typically the projective areas (e. g. , the calcarine cortex) that, if lesioned, lead to permanent loss of their functions. With regard to amnesia, it can be suggested that when lesions involve either the thalamus or the hippo- campus, the memory function cannot be taken over by any other vicarious structure, with both of these structures behaving as if they were projective in nature.

        "other": "anterior thalamus, and cingulate cortex, and the amygdala circuit, including amygdala, magnocellular part of dorsomedial thalamus, and orbitofron- tal cortex. In Mishkin s opinion, lesions involving only one of these anatomical routes are insufficient to cause severe amnesia, and only when both circuits were lesioned did animals present with severe amnesia. Regarding identification of the thalamic structures in- volved in L. C. s lesion, despite advanced techniques, it is very difficult to localize thalamic lesions when they are very small. The available neuroradiological techniques do not permit clear identification of different anatomical thalamic structures involved in a lesion. The midline thalamic nuclei are small (Mayes, 1995; the size of the dorsomedial nuclei is only a few millimeters) , only a few millimeters apart (Jones, 1985) and subject to individual variability. It is often a matter of conjecture which nuclei and tracts are damaged and which are spared on the basis of CT and MRI, however beautiful the images. We believe that any attempt to map the anatomical lesions in vivo in cases such as that of L. C. , would stretch the present possibility of localization rather too far. Furthermore, L. C. s functional study does not provide sufficient information regarding whether or not the cingulate cortex is involved in the functional metabolic reduction detected. It could be possible, given the close anatomical location, that the bilateral frontomesial dysfunc- tion detected in L. C. also involves the cingulate cortex; at least the available PET data cannot rule out this hypothesis. 5. , & Patel, S. (1989) .

Recent neuroimaging stud- ies have shown that not only the medial temporal lobes, but also the prefrontal lobes, contribute to cognitive functions. Methods: We describe a case of limbic encephalitis with abnormal- ities in the medial temporal lobes on MRI and decreased accumu- lation of radionuclide in the prefrontal regions on SPECT. Results: The patient had persistent retrograde amnesia, particularly affecting remotely acquired memories including public events and autobiographical memories. Conclusion: Disruption of the prefrontal-medial temporal circuitry by intense inflammation may have initiated the metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortices, which may exacerbate amnesia.

Cranial MRI showed abnor- mal signal in the medial temporal lobes, and she was hospital- ized. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 44 lympho- cytes, a protein concentration of 57 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 65 mg/dL. Acyclovir therapy (10 mg: kg ! + d~!) was started for a suspected diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. After 5 days, her condition remained un- changed, and she was transferred to our hospital. On admission, she was alert with no impairment of auditory comprehension, altered mentation, aphasia, agnosia, or apraxia. However, she was disoriented with respect to time, place, and her age. le inclu ing traveling, sickness, the death of family members, and the details of work. Moreover, she could not remember the location of places such as the rest room, even if she had gone there many times. She had a low score (10/30) on the Hasegawa dementia scale, ' based on 9 questions including tasks such as stating one s age, orientation with respect to date and place, memorizing 3 words, calculation (subtraction) , reciting figures in reverse order, repeating the last 3 words of a sequence, and memorizing 5 articles and the names of 10 vegetables. The score on the Mini-Mental Status Examination was also decreased (18/30) . Delayed memory (list, story, and figure recalls) was markedly impaired, whereas immediate memory (such as repetition of figures) was spared. The score on the Miyake memory test, which includes 10 items related to verbal memory function, was below average (3/10) . The patient could correctly mimic how to smoke a cigarette or ride a bicycle. The results of paper-and- pencil tests of extrapersonal neglect (line bisection and figure copy) were normal. Meningeal stiffness was absent. The deep tendon reflexes were normal, with no pathological reflexes. There was no weakness or ataxia. Involuntary movements were absent. Cranial nerves, superficial sensation, and vibratory senses were not impaired. Blood cell counts and the results of routine biochemical analysis were normal. Lumbar puncture performed on day 5 showed 80 white blood cells (99% lympho- cytes, 1% polymorphonuclear cells) , 177 red blood cells, a protein concentration of 53 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 66 mg/dL, with negative bacterial and Mycobacterium tuber- culosis cultures. Although polymerase chain reaction amplifi- cation of HSV in CSF was negative, a serum/CSF HSV antibody ratio was positive ($20) . Titers of HSV IgG anti- bodies in paired serum and CSF samples increased 2 weeks after initial examination (serum and CSF, 16 128 and 4-32, respectively) .

Serum levels of paraneoplastic autoantibodies (anti-Hu and anti-Yo) were normal. Electroencephalogram showed theta waves lo- calized in both temporal regions, without epileptiform dis- charges. Cranial T2-weighted MRI and fluid attenuated in- version recovery (FLAIR) imaging on day 7 showed bilateral regions of increased signal intensity in the medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, amygdaloid body, and parahippocampal gyrus, with positive gadolinium-diethyl- enetriamine pentaaetic acid (DTPA) enhancement (Fig. 1A, B, E, and F) . Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed re- gions of hyperintensity corresponding to the increased signals on T2-weighted and FLAIR images (Fig. 1D) . Initial SPECT imaging, performed with technetium-99m- ethyl cysteinate dimer on day 9, showed decreased accu- mulation in the prefrontal areas (Fig. 1G) . HSV encepha- litis was diagnosed. The patient received intravenous acyclovir (10 mg + kg! + d~', 14 days) . A repeat CSF analysis on day 43 showed 20 lymphocytes. Repeat MRI on day 35 showed abnormal high signals on diffusion-weighted images, and gadolinium-DTPA enhancement had disap- peared. Repeated SPECT imaging on day 36 showed that the decreased accumulation in the prefrontal areas was no longer evident (Fig. 1H) . However, anterograde and retrograde am- nesia persisted, with a low score on the Miyake memory test (2/10) and Hasegawa dementia scale (10/30) . Five years later, the has persisted, and she is unable to acquire new episodic memories, even concerning events that occurred 5 minutes ago. Although childhood and early adulthood memories can be recalled, adulthood memories spanning several decades are vague. Immediate memory and nondeclarative memory are not impaired. Because the patient has persistent amnesia, she re- quires assistance in activities of daily living. DISCUSSION Our patient with limbic encephalitis transiently showed decreased accumulation of radionuclide in the prefrontal cortices on SPECT. This decrease in the prefrontal areas might have been caused by metabolic reduction because there were no signal changes on conventional or diffusion-weighted MRI. Perhaps repetitive epileptogenic zones were not confined to the medial temporal lobe structures, but had spread to other areas, leading to functional changes of neurons in the frontal lobes. * However, the patient showed no epileptic forms in either the temporal or frontal areas on electroencephalogram. Thus, repet- itive seizures most likely did not contribute to the metabolic changes in the prefrontal areas. Neuroanatomical studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that the prefrontal cortex receives direct ana- tomic projections from the medial temporal regions. * More- over, recent neuroimaging studies have consistently demon- strated that the prefrontal cortices and medial temporal lobes are active during memory tasks. * Disruption of circuitry by intense inflammation may have initiated the metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortices. 256 FIGURE 1. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging (FLAIR) (TR/TE = 9000/124, Tl = 2200, ETL = 13) demon- strated increased signal intensity in the hippocampus and amygdaloid body (A and F) , as well as the parahippocampal gyrus (B and F) . There were no signal changes in the frontal lobes on FLAIR imaging (C) . Diffusion-weighted MRI (TR/TE = 3400/96, b = 1000 seconds/mm7, matrix 128 x 128, field of view 230 mm) revealed regions of hyperinten- sity corresponding to the increased signals on FLAIR imaging (D) .

Damage to a restricted region of the hippocampus selectively impairs memory of recently acquired information, but leaves more remote memory intact. * In contrast, the prefrontal cortex is more important in retention of remotely acquired memories than in retention of recently acquired memories. * Our patient with limbic encephalitis accompanied by metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortices also had severe retrograde amnesia, particu- larly affecting remotely acquired memories. Moreover, a recent study of autobiographical memory in patients with amnesia indicates that extensive damage involving the amygdala and surrounding cortices may more severely impair the recollection of unpleasant memories, as compared with damage involving the hippocampus itself. Patients with damage to the amygdala and parahippocampus in addition to the hippocampus are likely to have impaired retention of unpleasant autobiographical memories. Limbic encephalitis with destruction of medial tempo- ral lobe structures can affect the prefrontal cortices, which may exacerbate amnesia. 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins REFERENCES .

Email: eiju28af@med. showa-u. ac. jp Abstract Lesions of the medio-parietal lobes are linked with topographical and temporal disorientation, and are of interest to understanding mental time. We examined a 39-year-old man who worked as a driving instructor before cerebral hemorrhage, and followed his case for 8 years including neuropsychological testing and brain imaging. The patient had mild anterograde episodic amnesia, but no semantic amnesia. He felt that time passed too quickly, and developed a compulsive routine to compensate, although he was able to count time at a normal speed. Further- more, he was unable to accurately sketch the layout of his house and to make a cross-reference type timetable for the future. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed lesions of the left anterior posterior cingulate gyrus, and N-isopropyl-[!7*1] p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed decreased blood flow mainly of the left medio-parietal lobe. Introduction Temporal and topographical orientation is important to the evaluation of consciousness and cognitive function. Pure topographical disorientation is linked with the right retros- plenial cortex in the medial parietal lobe. ' Disorientation in time and place have been linked with posterior cingulate gyrus in Alzheimer s disease. ? The present patients had impaired temporal and topographical orientation at the same time. Case report A-39-year-old, right-handed man who worked as a driving instructor felt that time passed too quickly, and lived according to a clock watching routine (Fig. $1) for 8 years after a cerebral hemorrhage. Because of his difficul- ties, he returned to work as a clerk with the same company. His family had to accompany him both to the office and the hospital for 2 years, because he had difficulty in recalling routes. He even lost his way around the house. We examined the patient using the following: Mini-Men- tal State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, * Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, > Wechsler Memory Scale- Revised, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test and Behav- ioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome* (Table 1) . Screening tests revealed the patient was alert with no frontal 16 lobe dysfunction. He had mild anterograde amnesia and a mild attention decrease, but no visuospatial memory prob- lems. Autobiographical memory tests revealed anterograde amnesia for episodic memory, but no semantic or retrograde amnesia. We also interviewed the patient after his brain hemorrhage for symptoms connected with mental time and videotaped his comments (Video S1) . He was accurately able to count time at a normal speed, but estimated time to be shorter than it was (Video $2) . Furthermore, he was able to narrate the layout of his house, but unable to sketch it accu- rately (Video S3 and Fig. S2) and make a cross-reference type timetable for the future (Fig. S3) . Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out using a 1. 5T Magnetom Avanto (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 12-channel head coil. T2-weighted axial, T2 short- term inversion recovery axial and T2 coronal slicing was carried out of 5-mm thickness. Single-photon emission com- puted tomography imaging was carried out with a triple- headed gamma camera (GCA-9300R; Toshiba Medical Sys- tems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) , using fan beam collima- tors (N2) . Magnetic resonance imaging showed lesions of the left hemisphere involving anterior posterior cingulate gyrus as a result of brain infarct, and hemorrhage of the anterior cerebral artery (Fig. la, b) . N-isopropyl-[!7I]_ p- iodoamphetamine brain blood flow single-photon emission computed tomography showed decreased flow mainly in the left medio-parietal lobe (Fig. 1c) .

Discussion The medio-parietal lobe is thought to have a key function in topographical orientation. !: 7 The precuneus elaborates a central role in visuospatial imagery, episodic memory retrie- val, self-processing operations and first-person perspective taking.

The precuneus, together with the posterior cingulate cortex, is involved in processing intentions relate to the self. The precuneus, together with the frontal cortex, might be processing third-person perspectives. These net- works might make it possible to produce topographical an temporal maps. Furthermore, the posterior cingulate gyrus and retrosplenial region serve as connections between the hippocampus and precuneus, and are involved in episo- dic future thinking in both healthy control individuals an Alzheimer s disease patients. '' Given that topographical dis- orientation links with mental time travel disorder in the pos- terior cingulate gyrus and the retrosplenial region, these might be involved in converting time and place into internal allocentric maps. Our case presented with intercurrent symp- toms of mental time travel and spatial navigation, and we suggest that the medio-parietal lobes play an essential role in allocentric map-making. Such maps might provide topographical orientation, and mental time of the past an future. Damage to the retrosplenial region and posterior cin- gulate gyrus in the left hemisphere could be related to time- length estimation and topographical disorientation. Further- more, there are few reports of retrosplenial amnesia accom- panying a sense of time flying. MacDonald Critchley described time passing too quickly, or everything looking as if moving too fast (Zeitraffer Effekt) in the case of massive space-occupying lesions within the middle third of the cere- bral hemisphere. '? The fact that the damage involved the whole length of the cingulate gyrus seems associated with this disorder. We believe there is some support for this idea in related avian models, as migratory birds have biological clocks that partially provide a basis for temporal orienta- tion! The idea, al though tentative, is worthwhile, we believe. Humans, in common with other animals, might thus possess a Navi-time system (Fig. $4) . p-iodoamphetamine brain blood flow single-photon emission computed tomography.

Gur, PhD i Article abstract The role of individual structures within the diencephalon for memory functioning is unknown. We present anatomic localization of lesions and a longitudinal neuropsychological profile of a young man who had a bilat- eral diencephalic stroke in the interpeduncular profundus arterial territory. MRI localized the lesions to the mamil- lothalamic tracts and inferior thalamic peduncle. The amnesia was characterized by severe impairment in explicit recall of new facts and events, while word-completion priming and remote memory were intact. We suggest that the memory deficit results from a disconnection of the diencephalon from the medial temporal region. NEUROLOGY 1992; 42: 163-169 Bilateral anterior thalamic infarctions may result in a permanent amnestic syndrome. 1? The proposed anatomic basis of this is combined damage to hip- pocampal-thalamic pathways via the mamillothala- mic tract (Tmth) and medial temporal-thalamic pathways via the inferior thalamic peduncle. !? These pathways are closely adjacent in the anterior thalamus. To date, anatomically studied bilateral lesions that cause amnesia are found in this region, whereas bilateral medial thalamic lesions that do not cause amnesia are located more posteriorly. '? Cases with well-established chronic amnesia that have been studied with MRI are rare, and it is especially uncommon for these patients to be young. We have recently had the opportunity to study such a patient with bilateral thalamic infarc- tions and permanent disabling amnesia using MRI. We located the lesions using the Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas to establish which areas of the thalamus were involved. We have studied the patient serially for 3 years, characterized the acute and chronic phases of his problem, and explored retrograde memory and the dissociation between impaired explicit learning and preserved implicit learning. While motor learning is preserved in such patients, ? other paradigms of implicit learning, ie, priming, need to be explored further. In priming, subjects are not told to remem- ber stimuli, but simply to perform some task. Unlike explicit memory, where the subject con- sciously recalls information that was presented previously, implicit memory is measured through unconscious transfer from the first task to an experimental task. Our understanding of priming is very rudimentary, but studies with different amnesic populations have shown impaired explicit memory in contrast to intact implicit memory. The neural pathways underlying implicit memory pro- cesses are unknown. This case, with a clearly defined lesion, permits the role of the diencephalon in implicit learning to be examined. Moreover, this case is unique in that the patient is young and has a previously unremarkable neurologic history, making an additional degenerative process much less likely. Case report. Clinical data. M. P. , a 28-year-old white man, worked in the postal service and had an unremark- able medical history. He became acutely unresponsive, and was initially described as snoring with pinpoint pupils. Neurologic examination otherwise demonstrated withdrawal to painful stimuli without evidence of focali- ty. He remained lethargic for the first 24 hours, but he awakened and attempted to speak periodically. Two days after admission, he was in a semistuporous state. When he was awake, he appeared confused and his speech was slurred. By 1 week postictus, he exhibited fluctuating levels of consciousness. He was easily arousable and had periods where he could be tested while he was alert. The neurologic examination at 6 days was notable for limitation of vertical gaze, with approximately 20 to 30 From the Brain Behavior Laboratory, Departments of Psychiatry (Drs.

The location of these slices is drawn on the midsagittal slice. of voluntary upgaze and a similar amount of downgaze. A skew deviation was noted in upgaze with the left eye lower than the right. Larger vertical movements could be induced with the oculocephalic maneuver, Horizontal eye movements were normal. There was an asymmetry of the palpebral! fissures with the right larger than the left, suggesting a possible lid retraction on the right. Pupils were 3 to 4 mm equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the cranial nerves were normal. A mild decrease in the ability to perform the tandem walk was noted. Otherwise, motor and sensory examinations were fully intact, including cortical sensation. At 2 weeks, slight improvement in voluntary vertical eye movements was noted, but otherwise, his neurologic status remained 164 NEUROLOGY 42 January 1992 unchanged. By 3% months poststroke, the neurologic examination showed normal visual fields, eye move- ments, reflexes, cortical sensations, and gait. Laboratory tests revealed a Westergren sedimentation rate of 35 mm/hr 1 week postictus (normal, <20 mm/hr) . Admission PTT was elevated at 39. 8 seconds and remained elevated on repeat determination 1 week later. Studies to evaluate the presence of the lupus inhibitor were positive with a level of 1. 6% (normal, 0. 1 to 1. 2%) . Factor VIII was elevated at 280% (normal, 50 to 200%) . Anticardiolipin antibody studies were borderline elevat- ed for IgG and IgM at 2. 6 and 2. 9 SD above the mean. These findings were felt to be consistent with the pres- ence of a lupus anticoagulant state. Other studies to evaluate vasculitis, including ANA, Sm and Rho antibod- ies, anti-DNA antibodies, complement levels, and serum RPR, were all normal. Rheumatoid factor was negative as well. Anatomic studies. An initial CT on admission was negative. A follow-up CT 2 days later showed bilateral thalamic hypodensities suggestive of necrosis or infarc- tion. Three years poststroke, a multiplaner MRI was per- formed to aid in the precise localization of the lesion. Five-millimeter interleaved contiguous slices were obtained in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes using T, - (TR = 600 msec, TE = 12 msec) , proton density (TR = 3, 000 msec, TE = 30 msec) , and T, - (TR = 3, 000 msec, TE = 80 msec) weighted imaging (figure 1) , The MRI used a 1. 5-tesla magnet. The field of view was 22 cm, the matrix size was 128 X 256, and NEX = 1. Using T, -weighted images, the lesion was localized using a method that involves finding the three-dimensional location of the lesion in relation to the anteroposterior commissure line*> and is based on the Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas. 3 Figure 2 illustrates the lesions in sagittal view 5. 5 mm from midline. The lesions appear to be in the region of the paramedian artery distribution (interpeduncular profundus artery) of the thalamus and is larger on the right. It involves the Tmth, lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus, and lamella medialis polaris. There does not appear to be any involvement of dorsomedial nucleus, but the lesions can be seen to be in the pathway of the inferior thalamic peduncle (ie, the pathway from the medial temporal area to the dorsomedial nucleus) . The mammillary nuclei and other surrounding subcorti- cal and cortical regions (including size of ventricles) were viewed as normal. Neuropsychological assessment. Table 1 summarizes the results of repeated neuropsychological testing. At 1 year, M. P. was functioning in the low-average range of intelligence. Visual-spatial skills, simple conceptual skills, receptive language, naming, left-hand motor speed, and right-hand graphesthesia were within normal limits. Ability to focus and sustain attention for 6 min- utes, as measured by a continuous performance test, was variable but mildly impaired overall compared with age- matched controls. Other areas of difficulty included hypophonic, nasal, and aprosodic speech, reduced verbal fluency, mild right-hand motor slowing, mild left-hand dysgraphesthesia, and mildly slow visual scanning. By 2 years postictus, M. P. s cognitive performance had improved considerably. His level of overall intellectual functioning returned to its estimated premorbid level of functioning (from low-average to average range) . All other measures of neuropsychological functioning, except memory, were intact. Memory. Anterograde amnesia. Despite significant improvement in intellectual functioning, M.

For the past year, he has been unable to learn that Bush is the current presi- dent. As seen in table 2, with the exception of digit span which was normal, M. P. consistently scored in the Figure 2.

After a 20-minute delay, his free recall remained at zero (con- trols, 13 to 14) , and he correctly recognized only 56% of the words (controls, 100%) . On a figural memory test, his free recall was equally deficient. However, he recognized all four designs immediately as well as after a 30-minute delay, when a multiple-choice format (target and three foils) was employed. Impaired performance was also noted on recall of geometric forms perceived tactually, a test of immediate and delayed facial recognition, revised Corsi spatial block learning, and supraspan 166 NEUROLOGY 42 January 1992 digit learning. His performance was not aided by repeti- tion on any of these tasks. M. P. s memory for everyday activities appeared equal- ly deficient. When questioned about recent personal events, he frequently offered responses that were appro- priate in content but untrue. For example, in response to questions about his daily activities, he always stated I watch TV. One time, when asked what programs he watches, he responded with Gilligan s Island. The examiner asked which TV channel airs the program, and he answered channel 48 but could not give any infor- mation regarding a specific episode. When validating the information, it was learned that the station had been off the air for over 2 years, and the program had not been showing on any station. Despite his extremely poor performance on laboratory tests, it appears that M. P. can retain some information, but his recollections are not complete. One example is M. P. s awareness of his father s death, which occurred 1 year after ictus. While he states that his dad died of a heart attack, he cannot offer any details of the circum- stances or how long ago it occurred. In addition, he recog- nizes the neuropsychologist who has tested him for the past 3 years (B. L. M. ) , but he is unable to recall her name or profession. M. P. s mother also reported a few isolated events where he offered information that was acquired postictus. Retrograde amnesia. Because of M. P. s young age, we were unable to employ standardized tests of remote memory. Instead, we collected data from autobiographic interviews, anecdotal reports, visitation to his previous place of employment, and recognition of his high school yearbook pictures. Immediately after the stroke, M. P. exhibited a mild retrograde amnesia for some events dating back a few years. He recognized all his immediate family members. However, he was unaware that he had wed 2 years earli- er and begun divorce proceedings a year before the stroke. He did not recognize his current girlfriend whom he had known for several years and to whom he report- edly proposed marriage the morning of his stroke. Similarly, he was able to name a niece and nephew who were 2 and 5 years old but was unable to name or recog- nize a photo of the third niece who was only 6 months old. He recognized old photographs of friends and family members dating back to his childhood. Thus, immediate- ly after the stroke, there was a loss of past memories that appeared limited in time and persisted for approxi- mately 2 to 3 months. One year later, there was no evi- dence of any loss of remote information. It is not known whether the improvement was due to spontaneous recov- ery or whether he was reminded of the information from his mother, who frequently reviewed his personal history with him. One year poststroke, M. P. visited his job at the post office, which he had held for 5 years. Under close super- vision, he sorted mail by address according to the deliv- ery route. This job requires recognition of thousands of addresses. According to his supervisor s report, M. P. sorted all mail with old addresses without difficulty and with his usual rapid pace as if he had never been away. However, when the mail was addressed to new streets built after his stroke, he recognized the novelty of the addresses but could not learn the new routes after many repetitions. In an effort to measure autobiographic memories more formally, Crovitz technique of using single words as prompts for recall of personal episodic events was attempted. ! This was discontinued because M. P. became tearful and so upset discussing his past that he unplugged the tape recorder. Three years poststroke, M. P. s recall and recognition were assessed for faces and names of classmates in his high school graduation class of over 300 students, He received the same tests on two separate occasions, 2 months apart. This task, developed by Bahrick et al, included free recall of classmates names; recognition of photos when presented with distractor photos from a yearbook at a different school; recognition of names taken from his yearbook presented with distractor names; and matching of names with photos when pre- sented with nine other distractor names. The stimuli were selected at random. At both test sessions, his per- formance was excellent and consistent. He recalled an average of 12 names of classmates, recognized 10/10 pho- tographs, 9. 5/10 names, and matched 5/5 names with photos. Thus, his memory appears intact for information that was at least 14 years old because he has not had contact with any of his previous classmates or viewed his yearbook since his stroke. In contrast to his excellent ability to retain remote knowledge, M. P. had no recollec- tion at the second session of having taken this test 2 months earlier. Preserved learning ability. To determine whether M. P. would demonstrate the same dissociation between impaired explicit memory and intact implicit memory ability that is characteristic of other amnesic popula- tions, a repetition priming word completion test was administered at 2 months and 1 year poststroke. This test involved completing a list of the initial letters (eg, CHA_) of previously presented words (eg, CHAIR) . The subject is asked to write down the first word that comes to mind that begins with those letters. He is never told that he just read words that began with the same letters. This paradigm also included a spontaneous recall and a two-alternative, forced-choice condition. After M. P. s per- formance was corrected for guessing, he completed 60% of the words at 2 months and 40% of the words at 1 year, demonstrating intact priming effects. In contrast, he was unable to spontaneously recall any words from a compa- rable list but recognized 70% at 2 months and 50% at 1 year {chance performance, 50%) . Thus, his performance was facilitated through previous exposure to the words even though he did not recollect a specific experience of seeing the words before. In contrast, when instructed explicitly to retrieve words that he just saw in a specific prior experience, his performance was greatly impaired. Personality assessment. A behavioral disturbance characterized by apathy, lack of spontaneity, and depres- sion was noted immediately after the stroke. In addition, for the first 2 years postictus, M. P. s affect was extremely labile, and he often became tearful during conversations or testing. Sometimes this happened when speaking of his past, but many times he appeared tearful for no apparent reason. M. P. was unable to explain what pro- voked the tears and would deny feeling sad. Both the labile affect and depression have greatly resolved during the past year. There was no tearfulness noted at his last evaluation. However, the abulia and lack of initiative persist. Discussion. M. P. demonstrated a severe, perva- sive, and persistent anterograde amnesia without other measurable cognitive deficits, following bilat- eral circumscribed lesions confined to the anterior medial thalamus. Since the MRI localization was performed during the chronic phase, this mini- mizes possible distortion of the region. M. P. s ini- tial neurologic deficits suggested involvement of the intralaminar nuclei along with the adjacent upper mesencephalon. However, these signs ame- liorated, suggesting that these areas were involved indirectly, due to edema or diaschisis, and were not part of the permanent lesion site. The absence of permanent damage to the midbrain is further sup- ported by disappearance of M. P. s initial alter- ations in consciousness, attention, and neuro-oph- January 1992 NEUROLOGY 42 167 thalmologic deficits within 3% months after the stroke. Lastly, although the interpeduncular pro- fundus artery often supplies this midbrain region, it is variable in the territory that it supplies. 4 Premorbid memories, fund of semantic knowl- edge, and word-completion priming effects were spared. His impairment involved declarative knowledge or explicit memory of facts and episodes. ?> His memory loss was severely impaired in recall of prose passages, verbal paired associate learning, word lists, figural and geometric designs, faces, spatial information, and geometric forms per- ceived tactually. His retrograde amnesia, by con- trast, was transient and appeared to involve only some events that occurred within a few months of his stroke. While memory remained profoundly impaired, other areas of cognitive functioning have progres- sively recovered since the stroke. It has been reported that after cerebral infarct, metabolic changes occur in remote regions of the brain for as long as 3 months. * Some of M. P. s initial neuropsy- chological deficits were likely produced by alter- ations in other remote regions as well as by direct interruption of subcortical-cortical connections. As interconnections between healthy regions of the braiu resumed functioning, this was reflected in improvement on non memory-related tasks. That no improvement was noted on memory tasks strongly suggests that the stroke directly severed pathways critical for new learning. Other neu- ropsychological recovery continued for up to 3 years, and this may have been secondary to cogni- tive retraining procedures that emphasized com- pensatory strategies for focusing visual attention. Lateralized neuropsychological deficits occur in patients with unilateral diencephalic lesions. ?7 Because M. P. s infarct was larger on the right, we examined possible differences in the material-spe- cific nature of his dysfunction. His amnesia appears global as his performance was severely impoverished when he was required to recall verbal or visual material, except for normal performance on one simple visual recognition test. Concerning this exception, it is noteworthy that although he chose the correct response in a forced-choice condi- tion, he had no conscious recollection of having seen the designs before. This supports further the distinction between implicit and explicit memory. The severity and chronicity of M. P. s memory dysfunction, in the presence of focal MRI findings, are consistent with recent reports that amnesia for explicit facts and events occurs with damage to at least two pathways within the diencephalon: the hippocampal thalamic pathway via the Tmth, and other medial temporal structures via the inferior thalamic peduncle. The sparing of word-completion priming effects indicates that these pathways are not involved in the implicit memory system. Damage to the two fiber tracts connecting the medial temporal region to the diencephalon are most likely responsible for the deficit. In monkeys, 168 NEUROLOGY 42 January 1992 the inferior thalamic peduncle and the Tmth course adjacent to one another in the same region as M. P. s lesion. ? Thus, while the mediodorsal and anterior thalamic nuclei appear intact anatomical- ly, they may be functionally disconnected from medial temporal lobe structures critical for mediat- ing memory functioning. This has been suggested by others. *!2 Further support for a disconnection syndrome is that the nature of M. P. s amnesia is strikingly similar to the well-studied patient H. M. , who had a much more extensive lesion (a bilateral temporal lobectomy for remediation of intractable seizures) . **-34 Both men show a severe global amnesic deficit, a mild retrograde loss, and normal priming effects. Further follow-up will determine whether the level of M. P. s amnesia remains as severe as that of H. M. Neuroanatomic and clinical studies suggest that prefrontal regions may be another link within the temporal-diencephalic mnemonic pathway. Animal studies have shown that prefrontal cortex receives direct and indirect projections from both mesial temporal and diencephalic regions. **36 In addition, destruction of ventromedial frontal but not dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex results in a recognition memory disturbance in monkeys. * Differences in damage to specific nuclei and fiber tracts within the medial diencephalon may determine not only the severity of the amnesia but also the specific characteristics of the impairment. For example, dif- ficulty in temporal orientation and temporal sequencing of events has been associated with pre- frontal lesions in animals and humans. ** Similar deficits have been reported in some patients with thalamic infarctions and Korsakoff s syndrome, ?**41 but no such impairment has been found in patients with temporal lobe dysfunction due to electrocon- vulsive therapy. *? M. P. s judgment of time for events occurring postictus was poor. In addition, his recall for events did not appear facilitated by temporal cuing, but this needs closer investigation. M. P. s inability to judge events in a temporal con- text may be attributable to a further disconnection of diencephalic from frontal regions. This would be consistent with Warrington and Weiskrantz s con- cept# of amnesia as a disconnection of semantic memory, located in temporal-diencephalic regions, from the cognitive mediational memory system located in prefrontal cortex. This possibility is fur- ther supported by the observation that, in addition to cognitive deficits, M. P. exhibits apathy and decreased motivation, which are also compatible with frontal dysfunction. More studies with precise localization of the lesion are needed to determine the individual con- tribution of other diencephalic regions to memory functions. In a recent case study, * dense amnesia resulted after a snooker cue penetrated the brain, producing injury to the mammillary bodies but not to the thalamus. While the amnesia was severe for verbal material, this patient was less impaired than was M. P. In both cases, the Tmth appears to have been interrupted bilaterally, whereas the inferior thalamic peduncle was damaged only in M. P. Thus, M. P. s young age and small but strate- gically located lesions afford a unique insight into the role of the diencephalon in mediating memory. The preservation of implicit (word-completion priming) and remote memory suggests that these processes are maintained in brain regions other than those necessary for explicit recall of newly encountered facts and events.

Keywords: agnosia, amnesia, Ground- hog-day-syndrome, magno-parvocellular pathway, MRI, visual dissociation Received 15 October 2007 Accepted 8 February 2008 A 60-year-old male caucasian patient underwent shoulder surgery under total intravenous anaesthesia. Medical history included arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease. Following the otherwise uncomplicated surgery, the patient presented with a postoperative confusional state and was referred to our neurological department. Neurological examination revealed marked anterograde amnesia with a milder retrograde defect covering ap- proximately 3 months. Furthermore, there was an obvious visual disturbance: the patient was unable to read and exhibited prosopagnosia, not being able even to recognize familiar faces (e. g. from presented photographs of famous people) . Memory span was reduced to a few minutes and the patient would not recog- nize people shortly after an encounter, not only visually by faces due to prosopag- nosia, but also acoustically by voices. The latter was true for unknown people, while he was able to acoustically identify famil- iar people (e. g. relatives) , thus most likely reflecting anterograde amnesia. The neu- rological examination was otherwise un- remarkable, especially there was no aphasia, and the patient was able to calculate and to write. Formal memory testing (e. g. River- mead Behavioural Memory Test; California verbal learning test) confirmed e44 the marked anterograde amnesia. Due to the clinically obvious visual disturbance, ophthalmologic examination including perimetry was performed and revealed stato-dynamic visual dissociation [1], with a right paracentral scotoma upon static perimetry and in contrast retained perception of dynamic stimuli. In accor- dance with this finding, detailed neuro- psychological testing revealed alexia and marked visual agnosia for figures or objects presented to the patient statically, which he was unable to identify, i. e. name or describe their function. Furthermore, for example, he would not be able to identify parallel lines or to read a clock. In contrast, there was correct mental- spatial representation of figures presented dynamically: he was able to read a clock when the clock was drawn by another person. Also, he was able to correctly copy figures which he watched as they were being drawn (e. g. letters, numbers, geo- metric figures such as a house, the sun, etc. ) as well as objects moved into his visual field (e. g. a pen, a bottle, etc. ) . However, he exhibited difficulties in nam- ing these objects or describing their func- tion. The same however to a lesser extent than for visually presented objects was true for objects presented tactilely. In contrast, he was able to recognize objects by name. Interestingly, the patient was (a) (b) doi: 10. 1111/j. 1468-1331. 2008. 02115. x overall fully aware of his deficits and stated himself that he was suffering from the Groundhog-day-syndrome , i. e. the feeling of being in a repetitive time-loop and experiencing the same situation over and over again (as adopted from the so- called movie) . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an unusual pattern of pathologic signal alterations on diffusion- weighted imaging (DWI) : there was pathologic diffusion restriction affecting the hippocampus and inferior occipital cortex bilaterally, in accordance with the clinical picture (Fig. la) . Also, both cere- bellar hemispheres were affected. The symmetric lesion distribution with bilat- eral hippocampal involvement possibly reflects hypoxic changes [2] and was rather atypical for cerebral ischaemia. However, the latter can also not be excluded. Cardiovascular diagnostic work-up (in- cluding transesophageal echocardiogram, Doppler-/duplexsonography of extra- and intracranial arterial vessels, 24 h Holter- ECG, cranial MR-Angiography, CT of the aortic arch) was unremarkable except for some atherosclerotic vascular changes. Furthermore, EEG and extensive blood tests were normal. The clinical state lasted throughout the whole 2 week period of hospitalization, with subtle improvement over time. Upon Figure 1 Cranial MRI 2 days after shoulder surgery shows bilateral pathologic diffusion restriction upon DWI, especially affecting the hippocampi and inferior occipital cortex as well as the cerebellar hemispheres (a) .

These clinical and imaging findings seem to mirror differential pro- cessing of static and dynamic stimuli via distinct visual pathways [3], possibly corresponding to the parvo-magnocellular dichotomy that might confer differential vulnerability in neurometabolic crises.

        "case_report": "Neuropsychology Copyright 2008 by the American Psychological Association 2008, Vol. 22, No. 5, 658-668 0894-4105/08/$12. 00 DOI: 10. 1037/a0012542 Memory Loss Resulting From Fornix and Septal Damage: Impaired Supra- Span Recall but Preserved Recognition Over a 24-Hour Delay Seralynne D. Vann Cardiff University Christine Denby University of Manchester Seth Love Frenchay Hospital Daniela Montaldi University of Manchester Shelley Renowden Frenchay Hospital Hugh B. Coakham Bupa Hospital Despite increasing evidence that the fornix is important for memory, uncertainty remains about the exact nature of subsequent impairments arising from damage to this tract. This uncertainty is often created by pathology in additional brain structures. The present study involved a young man, DN, who had almost complete bilateral loss of the rostral columns of the fornix and much of the surrounding septum in the left hemisphere following the surgical removal of a cavernous angioma. Quantitative MRI analyses of structure size, normalized to intracranial volume, showed no difference in any of the additional brain regions measured, apart from those areas removed to expose the tumor. DN showed a marked, stable anterograde memory impairment that was still present 4 years postsurgery. In contrast, DN performed within normal levels on most tests of recognition memory. This sparing was most striking when given a 24-hr delay between study and test of the Warrington Recognition Memory Test. This recall/recognition dissociation provides further evidence for neuroanatomical divisions within recognition memory processes. Keywords: anterograde amnesia, fornix, septum, hippocampus, recognition memory Although there is growing agreement that fornix damage can severely clearer loss of both recall and recognition arise from other types of tumor or other aetiologies. This apparent distinction suggests a possible differ- ence in either the extent of fornix damage or the involvement of other structures in these conditions. Determining the anatomical basis of this sparing of recognition memory requires, therefore, a comparison of detailed structural and volumetric data from multi- ple brain regions across cases. Unfortunately, no such information has been provided in any previous study of fornix pathology. In response to these shortcomings we examined the cognitive status of a young man who had a cavernous angioma that extended ventrally from the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle to the most posterior part of gyrus rectus. A consequence of its surgical removal was the almost complete loss of the rostral columns of the fornix and much of the septum. His neuropathology status post- surgery was estimated from quantitative volume estimates of mul- tiple brain sites. Initial psychometric testing also indicated that despite marked memory problems his recognition memory some- times appeared near-normal. This apparent sparing prompted a more detailed analysis of his memory, including the use of recog- nition tests that are sufficiently demanding to avoid any possibility of ceiling effects. Previous studies of colloid cyst patients have relied heavily on the Recognition Memory Test (RMT; War- rington, 1984) , a forced-choice task comprising 50 words and 50 faces in which the test phase follows immediately after presenting the stimuli. Possible limitations of this test have been described (Kapur, 1987) , and it has been suggested that placing a 24-hr delay between stimuli presentation and the test phase provides a more sensitive test (Reed & Squire, 1997; Squire & Shimamura, 1986) . This extended retention interval, which has not previously been used in studies of fornix pathology, was adopted in the present study. Method Participants Approval for this study was provided by a Multi-Centre Re- search Ethics Committee (MREC) . All participants gave their informed consent before inclusion in the study. Case DN DN is a right-handed male who left school at age 16 and was 25 at the time of surgery (2002) . DN was working as a gardener when he presented at hospital after a flurry of epileptic fits. DN had no prior history of neurological disorders. DN was hospitalized and an MRI scan showed a moderate-sized cavernous angioma lying in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle. In the left hemisphere it involved the head of the caudate nucleus and extended down to the most posterior aspect of the gyrus rectus. Both fornices were distorted and compressed by the angioma. The patient s father reported that DN had experienced memory loss for the 2 days before hospitalization but DN did not report any memory problems once he had been admitted. Before surgery, DN was seen by the first author for an initial assessment of his memory. Fifteen days after his initial admission to hospital, DN under- went a left frontal image-guided craniotomy. As far as could be judged, total macroscopic removal of the angioma was achieved. Apart from developing pyrexia after the operation, which was treated with antibiotics, the patient recovered well after surgery and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. DN returned to work as a gardener and has continued to work since the oper- ation. Neuropsychological testing recommenced 8 months after surgery and structural magnetic resonance images were ac- quired 26 months postsurgery. Control Participants Neuropsychological assessments. When available, published normative data were used to assess the patient s performance on tests. However, a specific control group was used for the RMT (Warrington, 1984) with a 24-hr delay between sample and test as this was the only test for which normalized data were not available. The participants were age and gender matched (see Table 1) . MR Imaging Ten participants, of whom seven were male, underwent MR scanning to provide volumetric comparisons using identical pro- tocols to those used for DN. Although the mean age of these participants was slightly older than DN, this difference was not significant (t = 1. 21, p > . 2; mean age = 37. 3 years; range 24 47 years) . The participants gave fully informed written consent and were free of neurological or psychiatric disorders.

Postsurgery MRI Assessments of Neuropathology Image Acquisition Images of the brain were acquired using a 3T Siemens TRIO whole body imaging system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlan- gen, Germany) . A block of 72 coronal T1- weighted image slices of 0. 8 mm thickness were obtained using a 3D thin slice Magne- tisation Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence (TR = 2, 040 ms, TE = 5. 57 ms, T1 = 1, 100 ms, flip angle (FA) = 8 , acquisition time = 11 min/47 s) . The field of view of the images was 256 X 256 mm. Slice prescription was performed coronally, along the length of the fornix. In addition, an isotropic MPRAGE volume scan (TR = 1, 960 ms, TE = 4. 43 ms, Tl = 1, 100 ms, FA = 8 , acquisition time = 8 min/23 s) was acquired providing 172 contiguous coronal slices having a slice thickness of | mm, which was used for the measurement of the medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, hemispheres, and lateral ventricles. A further MRI sequence from the surrounding tissue (Brain Voyager soft- ware, Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) according to prescribed landmarks (Bilir et al. , 1998; Kuzniecky et al. , 1999; Zahajszky et al. , 2001) . With the exception of the mammillary bodies, all volume estimates came from the 1. 0 mm volume scans. Anatomical delineations for the medial temporal lobe structures have been published elsewhere (Ashtari, Barr, Schaul, & Bogerts, 1991; Cook, Fish, Shorvon, Straughan, & Stevens, 1992; Insausti et al. , 1998; Pruessner et al. , 2002; Howard, Roberts, Garcfa- Finana, & Cowell, 2003) . Presurgical Neuropsychological Assessment Diagnostic MRIs showed a moderate-sized cavernous angioma lying in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle causing istortion and compression of both fornices. Six days before sur- gery DN was tested on the National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982) and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test short form (COWAT; Benton & Hamsher, 1989) . The latter test assessed verbal fluency and required subjects to produce as many words as they could, beginning with the letters F, A, and S, one at atime for | minute each. DN s memory was assessed with one of the two immediate and delayed logical memory components of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R; Wechsler, 1987) and the Doors and People Test of Recall and Recognition (Bad- leley, Emslie, & Nimmo-Smith, 1994) . This test comprises two subtests of recall ( People, Shapes ) and two of recognition ( Doors, Names ) . As a consequence, each test has both a verbal and visual subtest. Postsurgical Neuropsychological Assessment (Presented by Time Postsurgery) WMS-III, WAIS-III, WTAR, FAS, RMT-Immediate (8 Months) DN was initially tested on the Wechsler Memory Scale Third Edition (WMS-III; Wechsler, 1997) and Wechsler Adult Intelli- gence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997) . DN was also tested on the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, 2001) to obtain a predicted premorbid IQ. To assess DN s postsurgery recognition memory he was tested on the RMT (Warrington, 1984) and verbal fluency was assessed using the COWAT-short form (Benton & Hamsher, 1989) . Doors and People Test, Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB) , Hayling and Brixton Tests of Dysexecutive Syndrome (20-21 Months) Twenty months postsurgery DN was tested again on the Doors and People Test of Recall and Recognition (Baddeley et al. , 1994) . Although readministration of this test provides a direct comparison with preoperative performance it was necessary to repeat the same test stimuli, so potentially compromise the test s sensitivity. DN was also tested on the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (Coughlan & Hollows, 1985) that provides a diverse array of recall tests. Executive function was assessed using the Hayling and Brixton tests of dysexecutive syndrome (Burgess & Shallice, 1997) . Remember/Know (32 Months) The Remember/Know procedure (Tulving, 1985; Yonelinas & Jacoby, 1995) was used to assess the two putative components within recognition memory: recollection and familiarity. The de- tails of the specific test procedures have been reported previously (Yonelinas DN s recognition memory was again assessed using the War- rington Recognition Memory Test (Warrington, 1984) , with the same target items and foils, but this time with a 24-hr delay between the study phase of the faces and names, and the subse- quent forced-choice recognition test. The unusually long retention interval helped to address the potential criticism that standard tests of recognition might be relatively easy, and so prone to ceiling effects. The use of a 24-hr retention interval for recognition tests modeled on the Warrington Recognition Memory Test has been adopted by Squire and his colleagues (e. g. , Squire & Shimamura, 1986; Reed & Squire, 1997) , and so we repeated this method but used the actual RMT stimuli and published instructions (War- rington, 1984) . As it was over 3 years since DN had seen the same test stimuli it was assumed that his scores would not be aided by this experience. Indeed, a case could be made that the repeat might make the task harder as both targets and foils could potentially be familiar. During the same session DN s autobiographical memory was tested using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1990) , which is designed to assess patients memories of facts about their past life as well as specific incidents and events from childhood, early adult life, and recent events. This test and the RMT (Warrington, 1984) were administered 4 years postsurgery. Finally, DN was tested with the full WMS-R (Wechsler, 1987) to assess the stability his memory impairment (4. 5 years postsur- gery) . DN had been previously given one of the two passages of the logical memory component immediately before surgery and so this passage had to be reused. Results Analysis of Neuropathology Descriptive DN s cavernous angioma was situated in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle and involved the head of the caudate nucleus and extended down to the most posterior aspect of the gyrus rectus in the left hemisphere. The placement of the angioma had caused both fornices to be distorted and compressed. The frontal approach taken in the surgery resulted in damage to the left premotor cortex (see Figures | and 2) . The head of the caudate nucleus, the anterior commissure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, nucleus accum- bens and were all partially damaged in the left hemisphere. Damage to the septum appeared complete in the left hemisphere and considerable in the right hemisphere. The precommissural fornix was completely severed on the left. There appeared to be some very limited sparing of the precommissural fornix on the right, with the tract looking abnormally thin and distorted. There was clear evidence of postcommissural fornix damage in both hemispheres although a small proportion of the fibers seemed to be spared bilaterally. Volumetric Analysis Structural scans were acquired 26 months postsurgery. It was found that DN had an unusually small intracranial volume (966 cm?, see Table 2) . For this reason, the structural measurements are given both as actual volumes and as normalized measurements (using intracranial volume, ICV) , though the latter are probably the more informative in view of his ICV. Both sets of measurements were analyzed using a test modification advocated by Crawford and Howell (1998) , which is preferred when comparing an indi- vidual s score against a small population. When ICV was taken into account no significant differences in volumes were found for any of the structures of interest in either hemisphere (smallest p = . 132, left orbito-medial prefrontal cortex) . Using actual volumes, DN s measurements were significantly smaller than the slightly older comparison group for the right (t = 3. 13, p < . 05, two-tailed) and left temporal lobe (tf = 2. 68, p < . 05, two-tailed) , and the left entorhinal cortex (t = 2. 69, p < . 05, two-tailed) . No other differences were significant. At first sight, it might seem sur- prising that there was no significant reduction in overall fornix volume, despite the clear damage to this structure. In fact, surgical transection of the fornix does not cause atrophy in that part of the tract caudal to the damage, that is, closer to the hippocampus (Saunders & Aggleton, 2007) . As the fornix dam- age in DN was at the very rostral limit of the tract, the lack of change in overall volume is not remarkable given the current resolution for such tracts. Presurgical Neuropsychological Assessment DN correctly pronounced 17 words on the NART (Nelson, 1982) giving him a predicted full-scale IQ of 100. On one short story recall test (taken from WMS-R; Wechsler, 1987) DN scored 6/25 on immediate recall (3rd percentile when scaled for both tests) and 2/25 on delayed recall (4th percentile when scaled for both tests) . On the COWAT word fluency test (Benton & Hamsher, 1989) DN produced 34 words (F = 14, A = 8, S = 12; 25-75th percentile) . On the Doors and People Test given before surgery DN scored 24/36 on recall of People (10-25th percentile) and 28/36 on recall of Shapes (Sth-10th percentile) , and scored 18/24 on recognition of Doors (25th percentile) and 21/24 on recognition of Names (75th percentile) . DN scored 10/12 (50th percentile) on a delayed test of People recall and 8/12 (<0. 2th percentile) on the delayed Shape recall test. Thi 662 VANN ET AL. Figure 1.

Damage also just extends to involve the right fornix (that is otherwise normal at that level) , involves the septum, part of the head of the caudate nucleus and lentiform nucleus and anterior limb of the internal capsule. More posteriorly, the left fornix is normal (d) . Postsurgical Neuropsychological Assessment (Presented by Time Postsurgery) WMS-III, WAIS-III, WTAR, FAS, RMT-Immediate (8 Months) DN s scores on the subtests of the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997) are given in Tables 3 and 4. DN performed within the normal range on all the subtests apart from Digit Symbol-Coding and Digit Span (see Table 3) . His overall IQ scores (FSIQ = 86) were within the low average range (see Table 3) . All DN s scaled-scores on the subtests of the WMS-III (Wech- sler, 1997) were at least | standard deviation below the mean (i. e. , less than 7) except for Immediate Face Recognition and Letter- Number Sequencing. All DN s memory indices, except for Imme- diate Visual Memory (that includes Face Recognition) and Work- ing Memory, were equal to or below the 5th percentile and significantly lower than would be predicted on the basis of his WAIS Full-Scale IQ (see Table 4) . For the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading Test (WTAR, Wech- sler, 2001) DN correctly read 31 words, giving a predicted full- scale IQ of 94, slightly higher than his actual WAIS-III score of 86. From his WTAR score DN had a predicted general memory score of 98, which once again was significantly higher than his actual general memory score of 67. On the COWAT word fluency test (Benton & Hamsher, 1989) DN produced 41 words (F = 15, A = 10, S = 16; 77-89th percentile) . When tested on the RMT (Warrington, 1984) , where the recog- nition memory test immediately followed the end of the sample phase, DN scored 50/50 on words (90th percentile) and 43/50 on faces (50th percentile) . Doors and People Test, Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB) , Hayling and Brixton Tests of Dysexecutive Syndrome (20-21 Months) On the Doors and People Test (Baddeley et al. , 1994) DN scored 30/36 (50-75th percentile) on recall of People, 30/36 (10-25th percentile) on recall of Shapes, 15/24 (5-10th percentile) on rec- ognition of Doors, and 21/24 (75th percentile) on recognition of Names. On the delayed tests, DN scored 10/12 (50th percentile) on recall of People and 11/12 (37th percentile) on recall of Shapes. MEMORY LOSS RESULTING FROM FORNIX AND SEPTAL DAMAGE 663 Figure 2. basal frontal lobe just anterior to the anterior margin of the 3rd ventricle and involving the inferior anterior aspect of the left caudate head and adjacent internal capsule. Intense hemosiderin staining extends around the resection cavity and along the septum and both anterior forniceal columns. The hemosiderin staining also involves the hypothalamus on the left, medial aspect of the anterior commisure and anterior globus pallidus. DN was tested on Form | of the AMIPB (Coughlan & Hollows, 1985) . At the bottom end of the scale, scores are only given as less than the 10th percentile so when DN s scores fall below this they are also reported as z-scores (Coughlan & Hollows, 1985) . DN s scores are given in Table 5. For the list-learning task a 15-word list was presented five times and DN scored 5, 7, 9, 8, 10 on each consecutive presentation. On the design, learning the design to be produced was also presented five times, out of a maximum of 9, DN scored 2, 4, 4, 7, 6 on each consecutive presentation. On all six tests of learning and recall (see Table 5) , DN s scores were at least 1. 65 standard deviations below the listed norms. This can be contrasted with his normal performance on the information pro- cessing tasks. DN s frontal function was assessed using the Hayling and Brixton tests of dysexectuive syndrome (Burgess & Shallice, 1997) . DN s overall scaled score on the Hayling Sentence Com- pletion Task was 5 (Moderate Average) whereas his scaled score on the Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test was 8 (Good) . Remember/Know (32 Months) In terms of overall detection of previously presented stimuli, DN performed well on this task as his hit rate was 0. 9 and his false alarm rate was 0. 18 (48/50 for the deep encoding condition and 42/50 for the shallow encoding condition) . This can be compared to the control scores (n = 7) from Aggleton et al. (2005) where the mean hit rate was 0. 87 + 0. 01 SD and the mean false alarm rate was 0. 16 + 0. 11 SD (48. 9 + 0. 9 SD for deep encoding and 38. 3 + 7. 61 SD for shallow encoding; both scores are out of 50) . It should be noted that these data come from participants who were older than DN and had higher IQs (Aggleton et al. , 2005) so the scores are only provided for approximate comparisons. How- ever, attempts to assess the separate components of DN s recog- nition memory using this procedure were unsuccessful because of DN s inability to meaningfully classify his responses. When DN was questioned further about his Remember responses they did Postoperative T2-weighted coronal MR images demonstrate the resection cavity in the anteriomedial not in fact qualify as Remember responses. The patient s inabil- ity to subjectively distinguish between the Remember and Know classifications means that the results of this test cannot safely be interpreted in terms of recall and familiarity. This classification problem appears similar to that encountered with the developmen- tal amnesic case Jon (Baddeley et al. , 2001) and is likely to be a frequent confound when memory problems are long-standing. RMT-Delayed, Autobiographical Memory Interview, WMS-R (4 to 4. 5 Years) DN was tested on the RMT (Warrington, 1984) with a 24-hr lelay between the sample and test phase (see Table 1) . Again, using the modified test suggested by Crawford and Howell (1998) , there was no difference between DN and the age-matched controls on either words (t < 1) or faces (t = 1. 43, p > . 2) . On the faces Test DN outperformed the six control subjects. On the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman et al. , 990) DN scored in the acceptable range on the personal se- mantic schedule (total 58/63; childhood, 21/21; early adult life, 7/21; recent life, 20/21) but scored in the definitely abnormal range on the autobiographical incidents schedule (11/27) and was impaired on all three time periods (childhood, 4/9; early adult life, 4/9; recent life, 3/9) . DN was finally tested on the WMS-R (Wechsler, 1987) to assess the stability of his memory impairment. His scores, which are comparable to those from the WMS-III (8-months postsurgery) and therefore show a persistent memory deficit, are presented in Table 6. Discussion The present study concerned a young man who underwent surgery for a cavernous angioma. Assessments of the cognitive effects of the tumor and the resultant surgery revealed a variety of memory deficits that are most likely because of tissue loss in the 664 Table 2 Volume Estimates for DN and the Mean and SD of 10 Comparison Subjects (All in cm ) and Intracranial Volume Normalized Z-Scores (ICV-Norm Z-Scores) for DN Temporal lobe Hemisphere Lat. ventricle Amygdala Perirhinal Entorhinal Hippocampus ICV Age 178. 17 1212. 22 966 6. 96 1. 70 18 =0. 55 71 2. 09 2. 7 0. 48 562. 11 553. 18 63. 44 67. 26 471 434. 5 0. 21 82. 98 9. 18 57. 2 1 0 00. 0 =SH sor 1 0. 25 0. 68 3. 26 1. 29 2. 92 2. 98 0. 8 2. 16 0. 74 1. 69 0. 21 1. 4 0. 09 17 0. 29 1. 37 0. 07 2. 76 0. 46 2. 83 0. 48 1. 92 0. 95 7. 45 37. 3 27 ICV-norm Z-scores Comparison group SD DN OMPEFC Temporal pole PHC PHG OLPFC DLPFC DMPFC M bodies Fornix 3. 75 0. 69 8. 2 7. 62 8. 07 9. 47 4. 68 2. 48 24. 2 0. 072 0. 07 27. 04 21. 22 21. 87 0. 56 0. 16 0. 51 0. 37 0. 52 0. 12 047 0. 2.

Before surgery, these structures were compromised by the position and size of the cavernoma; after surgery there was additional damage that was attributed to the surgical approach and removal of the tumor. Interest in this case arose for several reasons. First, he showed bilateral damage to the fornix and septum from an etiology rarely described when assessing the impact of pathology to these structures on cognition (Tucker et al. , 1988; von Cramon, Markowitsch, & Schuri, 1993; Yasuno et al. , 1999) . Second, there was no evidence of ventricular enlargement around the time of testing or at surgery (unlike in many colloid cyst cases) , implying that distal regions remained intact. This assumption was supported by detailed volumetric MRI analyses. Third, it was possible to make an initial psychometric assessment immediately before the surgery for his tumor. Fourth, and probably the most notable feature, was his striking preservation of recognition memory after a 24-hr delay in the face of a persistent, anterograde memory impairment. Before surgery DN showed memory difficulties that were evi- dent for prose recall (WMS-R) but less clear on the Doors and People test (Baddeley et al. , 1994) . The position of the angioma in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle, which distorted and compressed the fornix and septum bilaterally, presumably contrib- uted to these patchy memory problems. After surgery, it became clear that DN had persistent and reasonably severe deficits on most recall tests of episodic memory. In contrast, his IQ scores were little, if any, affected, nor did he display evidence of frontal cortex dysfunction. DN performed poorly on the Autobiographical Mem- ory Interview, but due to the nature of his pathology it is possible that this does not reflect a retrograde memory impairment per se but is in fact a reflection of long-standing impoverished encoding. With the occasional exception of tests that were administered repeatedly, DN showed a consistent profile of memory loss. Namely, a deficit on most recall tests of episodic memory that contrasted with relatively intact working memory and recognition memory. This pattern was found across all subtests of the AMIPB (Coughlan & Hollows, 1985) and most subtests of the WMS-III and WMS-R. Consequently, the majority of tests where DN s performance was intact directly taxed recognition (Faces I, WMS- III; Figural Memory, WMS-R) or working memory (Letter-Num- ber Sequence, WMS-III; Visual Span, WMS-R) . His abnormally poor (5th percentile) Auditory Recognition Delay index for the WMS-III does not, in fact, represent an exception to this pattern. His low score on this index is a reflection of his poor performance on the first component from which this index is derived. For this, participants are first asked to freely recall information from the logical memory story and then, for the Auditory Recognition Delay Index score, they are asked whether particular statements reflect the gist of the story. Performance on this task would, therefore, rely very heavily on recall and is not a true test of recognition. The severity of DN s memory loss can be appreciated by com- paring DN s performance on the WMS-R to a much older group of 16 amnesics, mainly alcoholic Korsakoffs, used to assess the sensitivity of the WMS-R (Butters et al. , 1988) . DN s index scores for General Memory (66) and Delayed Recall (75) can be com- pared with their mean scores of 72 and 57, respectively. DN s somewhat higher Delayed Recall index probably reflects his slightly milder memory impairment and his younger age.

It is likely that damage to the fornix and septum was the principal cause of the memory deficits shown by DN. The fornix has a unique, strategic position, linking the medial temporal lobe with the diencephalon, basal forebrain, ventral striatum, and pre- Table 4 DN s Scaled-Scores for Sub-Tests of the WMS-III and Overall Index Scores and Percentiles (8 Months Postsurgery) Sub-test Scaled-score Logical memory I 6 Logical memory II 6 Faces I 8 Faces IT 6 Verbal paired associates I 3 Verbal paired associates II 4 Family pictures I 6 Family pictures II 5 Spatial span 6 Letter number sequence 8 Auditory recognition delayed 5 Index Predicted score from Index score Percentile WMS-III FSIQ Auditory immediate 68 ard 92\"* Visual immediate 81 10\" 95 Immediate memory 69 ard 92\"* Auditory delayed 71 are 92\"* Visual delayed 72 art 94\"* Auditory recognition delayed 75 5 93 * General memory 67 oe 92** Working memory index 83 13\" 90 Note.

The large majority of the medial temporal lobe efferents in this tract emanate from the hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum (Rosene & Van Hoesen, 1987; Saunders & Aggleton, 2007; Swanson & Cowan, 1977) . The fornix also conveys projections to the medial temporal lobe, the majority of which arise from the medial septum (Saun- ders & Aggleton, 2007) . Although damage centered in the septum has been shown to be sufficient to disrupt memory performance (von Cramon, Markowitsch, & Shuri, 1993) , it is possible that the impact of the septal damage in DN need not be additive to that of the fornix damage as its major impact on memory is likely to be via fibers that use this tract. The postsurgical pathology also extended unilaterally into other sites, including nucleus accum- bens, head of the caudate nucleus, and additional parts of the basal forebrain (e. g. , vertical limb of the diagonal band) . Despite this further damage, two factors strongly suggest that the fornix/septal damage was the key cause of the memory loss. First, unlike these other regions, the damage to the fornix and septum was bilateral. The septal damage was seemingly complete in the left and con- Table 6 DN s Raw Scores for Sub-Tests of the WMS-R and Overall Index Scores (4. 5 Years Postsurgery) Sub-test Raw-score Information and orientation 14/14 Mental control 6/6 Figural memory (recognition) 8/10 Logical memory I 10/50 Logical memory II 8/50 Visual paired associates I 14/18 Visual paired 6/6 Verbal paired 10/24 Verbal paired as: 4/8 Visual reproduction I 29/41 Visual reproduction IT 25/41 Digit span: forward 6/12 Digit span: backward 5/12 Visual memory span: forward 10/14 Visual memory span: backward 6/12 Index Index score Verbal memory 63 Visual memory 91 General memory 66 Attention/concentration 81 Delayed memory 75 666 VANN ET AL. siderable in the right hemisphere. Likewise, the precommissural fornix seemed absent on the left with only the most lateral strip surviving on the right, whereas there was at least partial bilateral damage to the postcommissural fornix. Given his largely equiva- lent pattern of memory loss for both verbal and nonverbal material it seems most likely that the critical site suffered bilateral damage implicating the fornix and septum. In addition, partial damage to the basal forebrain in macaques appears insufficient to induce mnemonic impairments (Aigner et al. , 1991) , indeed basal fore- brain damage is most often linked to changes in attention (Baxter & Chiba, 1999) . Finally, most of the other sites suffering unilateral damage (e. g. , diagonal band and nucleus accumbens) have hip- pocampal connections via the fornix (Aggleton, Friedman, & Mishkin, 1987; Saunders, Mishkin, & Aggleton, 2005) . Thus, it may well be that any additional impact on memory from this damage was subsumed by the fornix pathology. Historically, there has been some dispute over whether fornix pathology is sufficient to induce anterograde amnesia (Gaffan & Gaffan, 1991; Garcia-Bengochea & Friedman, 1987; Woolsey & Nelson, 1975) but in recent years evidence for the importance of this tract has become much stronger. Studies into the impact of surgical removals of colloid cysts, benign cysts found in the 3rd ventricle, have consistently implicated fornix damage as a cause of amnesia (Aggleton et al. , 2000; Gaffan & Gaffan, 1991; Hodges & Carpenter, 1991; McMackin et al. , 1995) . Interpretation of these studies is, however, complicated by the typical presence of ob- structive hydrocephalus, at least at the time of surgery. Interpreting previous reports of memory loss associated with fornix damage caused by tumors other than colloid cysts has been compromised by additional damage to the thalamus (Tucker et al. , 1988; Yasuno et al. , 1999) , the hippocampus (Tucker et al. , 1988) , the hypothal- amus (Calabrese et al. , 1995) , the cingulum bundle (von Cramon & Schuri, 1992) , previous subarachnoid hemorrhages (Heilman & Sypert, 1977) , and the need to use multiple surgical approaches to remove the tumor (Calabrese et al. , 1995) . DN, therefore, adds further support to the importance of the fornix as he shows no evidence of pathology in these sites, that is, the fornix becomes the common site of pathology in all of these diverse conditions. Another group of patients who show some similar pathology to DN (i. e. , damage to the septum/basal forebrain) , are those who have suffered from aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery. Although memory impairments are associated with this etiology they are often co-occur with confabulation, dysexecutive, and personality changes, as well as more diffuse damage extending to the striatum and/or ventral frontal cortex (for a review see DeLuca & Diamond, 1995) . As DN shows no evidence of a dysexecutive syndrome, personality changes, or confabulation close comparisons with this group of patients are difficult to make (although see Hanley, Davies, Downes, & Mayes, 1994; Hanley et al. , 2001) . In some, but not all, descriptions of the memory loss accompa- nying fornix damage is the finding of a relative sparing of recog- nition memory. This sparing has been taken as support for those dual-process models of recognition that assume that damage to the extended hippocampal system largely spares familiarity-based rec- ognition but impairs recollective-based recognition (Aggleton & Brown, 2006; Carlesimo et al. , 2007) . Direct evidence to support the dual-process model of recognition has been obtained using tasks such as Remember/Know and Receiver-Operating Charac- teristics (for a review see Yonelinas, 2002) . However, both of these tests are based on subjective decisions and require the articipant to have a clear understanding of the task demands. In atient DN, attempts to dissociate the two proposed components of recognition memory using Remember/Know were unsuccessful ecause of a lack of understanding of what comprised a Remem- er response. This is a similar problem to that encountered with the developmental amnesic case Jon (Baddeley et al. , 2001) , sug- gesting that this may not be a suitable method to dissociate these rocesses in patients with memory problems from childhood. This is pertinent for DN as the position and nature of the tumor show that his memory problems were probably long-standing, raising the question of how he could validly categorize Remember and Know decisions. Despite DN s inability to properly distinguish Remember and Know responses, he was able to correctly recog- nize 90% of the previously presented words on this task. There is, to date, only one other study where these two components of recognition memory were examined in a patient with fornix dam- age; this study made use of stimuli that were specific to the atient s personal/semantic history (Gilboa et al. , 2006) . It was found that the patient s recognition memory for semantic personal istory was supported by familiarity but not recollection (Gilboa et al. , 2006) . One criticism of the dual-process model is that examples of spared recognition memory in cases with impaired recall might e an artifact as recognition tests are often relatively easy and, thus, confounded by ceiling effects. Preserved performance on the RMT in patients with anterograde amnesia has been reported following various aetiologies including hypothalamic glioma (Par- kin & Hunkin, 1993) and anterior communicating artery aneurysm (Hanley, Davies, Downes, & Mayes, 1994; Hanley et al. , 2001) , although the issue of task difficulty makes these cases harder interpret. To preclude ceiling effects, task difficulty can be in- creased by lengthening retention delays. Squire and colleagues (e. g. , Reed & Squire, 1997; Squire & Shimamura, 1986) have accordingly used a recognition memory test based on the RMT (Warrington, 1984) , but with a 24-hr retention delay as a means of increasing task sensitivity; this approach was used in the present study. Although the stimuli used by Squire and colleagues are not the same as those in the actual RMT (Squire & Shimamura, 1986) , the performance of their 50-year-old controls and those of the controls in the present study are very similar (words = 41. 1 vs. 40. 7 in present study, faces = 38. 1 vs. 39. 7 in present study; see Squire & Shimamura, 1986) . This comparability underlines the impressive performance of DN on the task with 24-hr delay (words = 41, faces = 47) , in the face of his very clear recall deficits. The present study strongly indicates that damage to the fornix and surrounding septal areas can produce persistent memory im- pairments that are still evident more than 4 years after surgery. The stability of DN s memory deficit is reflected in the consistent general memory indices from the WMS-III and WMS-R, despite being administered almost 4 years apart. Probably the most strik- ing feature of DN s mnemonic profile was his preserved recogni- tion performance after a 24-hr delay. The dissociation between DN s intact RMT scores and his ongoing deficits on most tests of recall of both verbal and nonverbal material remains extremely difficult to reconcile with those theories that assume the inextri- cable linkage of recall and recognition memory after hippocampal MEMORY LOSS RESULTING FROM FORNIX AND SEPTAL DAMAGE 667 damage (Manns, Hopkins, Reed, Kitchener, & Squire, 2003; Squire et al. , 2007; Wixted & Squire, 2004) . Instead, DN provides support for those models that assume that the extended-hippocam- pal system is most needed for recollection (Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Skinner & Fernandes, 2007) .

        "other": "disrupt memory, there remains much uncertainty about both the causes and the nature of this memory loss. Resolving these uncertainties is important as the fornix is the major link connecting the hippocampal formation with both subcortical struc- tures and the prefrontal cortex. Consequently, models of how the hippocampus interacts with these other regions to support memory need to include predictions about the importance of the fornix for memory. Damage to the fornix only occurs rarely, and findings on the consequences of tract damage on memory come from diverse conditions. Although some studies refer to the removal of colloid cysts in the third ventricle (Aggleton et al. , 2000; Cameron & Archibald, 1981; Gaffan, Gaffan, & Hodges, 1991; Gilboa et al. , 2006; Hodges & Carpenter, 1991; McMackin, Cockburn, Anslow, Christine Denby, School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK; Seth Love, Department of Neuropathology, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, UK; Daniela Montaldi, School of Psychological Sci- ences, University of Manchester, UK; Shelley Renowden, Department of Neuroradiology, Frenchay Hospital Bristol, UK; Hugh B.

In none of these conditions is the pathology con- fined to the fornix as complications arise from ventricular dilation (e. g. , in the case of colloid cysts) , from invasion by the tumor into other regions, from the tissue lost in gaining surgical access to the fornix region (e. g. , for tumor removal or arterio-venous malfor- mations) , or a combination of the above. To identify the specific effects of fornix damage it is, therefore, necessary to combine information from multiple cases with multiple aetiologies. One apparent area of disagreement concerns the effects of fornix damage on recognition memory. Although some studies appear to show a relative sparing of recognition when compared to the loss of the recall of episodic information (Aggleton et al. , 2000; Hodges & Carpenter, 1991; McMackin et al. , 1995) , this dissoci- ation has not been noted in other studies (Calabrese et al. , 1995; D Esposito et al. , 1995; Heilman & Sypert, 1977; Park et al. , 2000; Poreh et al. , 2006) . Understanding why some cases might show a sparing of recognition memory is important as different models of hippocampal function make very different assumptions about the nature or even the existence of this dissociation (e. g. , Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Squire, Wixted, & Clark, 2007) . According to some, the hippocampus is critical for relational processing, such as form- ing contextual associations, whereas aspects of recognition, such MEMORY LOSS RESULTING FROM FORNIX AND SEPTAL DAMAGE 659 as specific item information, can be supported by the parahip- pocampal region, and the perirhinal cortex in particular (Diana, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007; Eichenbaum, Yonelinas, & Ran- ganath, 2007) . These views contrast with alternative theories that postulate that recollective and familiarity components of memory in fact correspond to strong and weak memory traces, respectively. Within this framework, the hippocampus and surrounding cortices all support recognition memory such that any dissociations seen between recognition and recall do not indicate separate memory systems but a preservation of stronger memories (e. g. , Squire, Wixted, & Clark, 2007) . A consideration of those bilateral fornix cases with an apparent sparing of recognition memory reveals that they all concern the removal of colloid cysts (Aggleton et al. , 2000; Hodges & Car- penter, 1991; McMackin et al. , 1995; although see Poreh et al. , 2006) . In contrast, those studies reporting a was employed as a method of normalizing the data for differences in head size across partici- pants. This sequence was a T2-weighted intracranial volume (ICV) scan, parameters were TR = 3, 000 ms, TE = 102 ms, FA = 150 , 3 mm slice thickness, 10 mm slice gap, acquisition time = 2 min. The field of view of the images was 220 < 220 mm. Volume Estimation Unbiased estimates of structure volume were obtained using the Cavalieri method of modern design stereology in combination with point counting techniques (Cruz-Orive, 1989, 1993; Garcia-Fi- flana, Cruz-Orive, MacKay, Pakkenberg, & Roberts, 2003) with the use of EasyMeasure Software (easymeasure. co. uk) . The Cava- lieri method functions by taking the total section area of a com- partment and multiplying it by the section interval (or slice thick- ness) to estimate the volume of the compartment without bias (Gunderson & Jensen, 1987) . The volume of the structure was estimated by counting the number of points falling inside the region of interest and multiplying the total number of points by area per point, to provide an unbiased estimate of the section area. The points were summated in EasyMeasure software to provide an unbiased volume estimate of the structures, which also included the associated coefficient of error (CE) . This measure takes into account the error introduced into the measurement procedure by slicing the structure of interest, and the point counting procedure. An overall fornix volume was obtained by manually segmenting out the structure et al. , 2002, 1998) . The participant first heard 25 words and indicated how many syllables were in each word (i. e. , the shallow encoding condition) and then heard 50 additional words and rated the pleasantness of each word using a 6-point scale (i. e. , the deep encoding condition) . This was followed by another 25 words encoded under the shallow encoding instructions. A recog- nition test was given immediately afterwards in which subjects heard the 100 studied words intermixed with 50 novel foils. The MEMORY LOSS RESULTING FROM FORNIX AND SEPTAL DAMAGE 661 participant was asked to indicate if each word was remembered, familiar but not remembered, or new. A remember response was to be given if he could recollect something specific about the moment they studied the word, such as what he thought about, what judgment he made about the word or his initial reaction to the word. A familiar response would be appropriate if the participant thought the word was studied earlier but could not recollect any specific details about the study event. Finally, if the participant did not think that the word was studied earlier, a new response was to be given. A sheet of test instructions was available for referral throughout the test period. For the first 20 test items and for several items throughout the rest of the test the participant was required to explain why a particular response was made.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed pathological changes in the bi- lateral hippocampi, parahippocampal gyri, fusiform gyri, medial temporal poles, posterior part of the cingulate gyri, and insula. The patient showed severe amnesia for autobiographical episodic memory in relation to events that had occurred throughout her life, but temporally graded amnesia for autobiographical semantic memory, and severe amnesia without a tem- poral gradient for public events and famous people. However, using a multiple-choice method, she showed a high level of accuracy when choosing keywords related to public or personal events, although this did not prompt her recollection of the events. An important indication of these results is that, even with severe retrograde amnesia, memories of past events are not completely lost. We propose that an Nadel, 2000, for reviews of retrograde amnesia) . Within autobio- graphical memory, further divisions have been proposed, such as personal episodes and personal semantics (Dall Ora, Delia Sala, & Spinnler, 1989; Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1989) , and several researchers have reported dissociation between these two aspects (Cermak & O Connor, 1983; Damasio, Eslinger, Damasio, Van Hoesen, & Cornell, 1985; O'Connor, Butters, Miliotis, Eslinger, & Cermak, 1992; Warrington & Duchen, 1992; Kapur et al. , 1994; Kapur et al. , 1996; Hirano & Noguchi, 1998) . With respect to retrograde memory for factual knowledge, McCarthy and War- rington (1992) reported the selective preservation of semantic (context-independent) knowledge in people with concomitant loss of memory for events in which they were involved. Ross and Hodges (1997) also described a patient who showed impaired knowledge of public events but well-preserved knowledge of famous people. In the present paper, we describe a case of severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia resulting from herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) . We focused our investi- gation on the status of retrograde memory and tried to elucidate a possible patho- physiological mechanism of its impairment. 2.

After she arrived at her house, she developed a severe headache and fever. The following day, she became unconscious and was admitted to the Neurology Service of Sendai City Hospital. The diagnosis of HSE was made by examination of her cerebrospinal fluid. Intravenous acyclovir and anticonvulsants were started. When the patient recovered consciousness a few days later, she was disoriented with respect to time and place, and showed severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Her family members noticed a mild personality change. On January 7, 1998, she was transferred to the Tohoku University Hospital for assessment and rehabilitation of her memory disturbances. On admission, the neu- rological examination was unremarkable, apart from disorientation with regard to time and place, and severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia. On neuroradio- logical examination, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high- intensity areas in the bilateral hippocampi, parahippocampal gyri, fusiform gyri, medial temporal poles, posterior part of the cingulate gyri, and insula (Fig. 1) . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [!7I][MP showed a dimi- nution of regional blood flow in the bilateral temporal lobe. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed normal basic rhythm and no epileptic discharge. The first systematic neuropsychological examination showed no impairments of language, perception, praxis, constructional ability, calculation or frontal lobe functions, despite the patient s disorientation with regard to time and place and severe anterograde and retrograde memory impairments. Immediate memory was preserved for both the verbal and spatial domains. Retrograde amnesia for remote memories appeared to extend over the patient s whole lifetime, although some T.

The MR images were sliced in parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus. For details, see text. knowledge about remote events seemed to be preserved. The results of the general neuropsychological tests are summarized in Table 1. 3. Examination for retrograde amnesia 3. 1. General assessment for retrograde amnesia First, we assessed the patient s memory for public events and famous people with a modified version of the Public Event Test (Fukatsu, Fujii, Sato, Kimura, & Saso, 1994) and a modified version of the Dead or Alive Test (Kapur, Young, Bateman, & Kennedy, 1989) adapted for the Japanese population (Fujii, Yamadori, Endo, Suzuki, & Fukatsu, 1999) . In the former test, the questionnaire consisted of 16 questions per decade, from 1950 to 1997. The patient was asked to read a question and to recall the name of an event or a person relevant to the question. If she was unable to recall the name or event, four choices per question were given (recognition) . Thus, for each decade, the maximum score was 16. The latter test consisted of 40 items. For each of the four decades, from the 1960s through the 1990s, eight famous people were selected who had died during that decade (32 items) . The remaining eight items consisted of the names of eight living persons. The patient was requested to indicate whether a famous person was dead or alive and, if she thought the person was dead, when he/she had died (in 5-year bands) . Two points were allotted for each correct dead judgment. If the answer was incorrect, no points were allotted. A further two points were added if the subject could correctly indicate the year of the death within one 5-year bandwidth. Thus, for each decade, the maximum score was 32. 4 T.

The patient s autobiographical memory was then examined using the Autobio- graphical Incidents Schedule and the Personal Semantic Memory Test (Kopelman et al. , 1989) . She showed a profound impairment in recalling autobiographical episodes over her whole lifetime. On the Personal Semantic Memory Test, recall of events was more impaired for her recent and early adult life than for her childhood (Table 2) . 3. 2. Special assessment for retrograde amnesia General assessment for retrograde amnesia confirmed that the patient had severe retrograde amnesia, especially with regard to her memory for public events and autobiographical episodic memory. However, we were impressed by the occasional clinical observation that she seemed to have a vague memory of forgotten events if an adequate cue was presented. For example, even though she could not recall a full account of a certain event, the patient did pick up a relevant word when made to choose one word from several candidates. To confirm this impression, we devised new tests for retrograde amnesia, and assessed the patient s retrograde amnesia in more depth. T.

Cued recall of autobiographical episodic events Items selected for this test were based on information obtained from an interview with the patient s family. In this test, the examiner first orally presented the patient with two words related to a particular autobiographical event, i. e. , one for time and the other for space (or person) . The patient was asked to recall the details (scene) of the event based on these two words. If she could not recall the details, she was then orally presented with a keyword representing the event and was again asked to recall details (scene) of the event represented by the word. The task was divided into four temporal phases: (1) from her birth to 1965, (2) from 1966 to 1980, (3) from 1981 to 1990, and (4) from 1991 to the present. There were 20 questions in total, with five questions in each period. The score was recorded in three parts. The patient was given two points when she correctly recalled the details of a specific autobiographical event after being given only two words indicating its context. When she correctly recalled the details of a specific autobiographical event from the two contextual words and one keyword, she was given one point. Otherwise, zero was entered. The results of this task are shown in Fig. 2. The patient showed extensive deficit in the retrieval of autobiographical memory, even with cues. 3. 2. 2. Memory for public semantic knowledge In the Public Semantic Memory Test, the examiner first orally presented the patient with four keywords related to a particular event (words or very short phrases) , one by one, and asked her to choose one word she knew or felt to be fa- miliar (recognition of a keyword of an event) . A set of four verbal keywords con- sisted of one related to a real event and three fabricated distracters. Then, if the item the patient had chosen was correct, the examiner asked her to explain the details of the event (recall of relevant knowledge) . If she was unable to explain the details, she was orally presented with four further verbal cues describing the content of the event, one by one, including one target and three distracters. She was asked to choose one cue that was relevant to the keyword she had chosen (recognition of relevant knowledge) . When the patient was able to complete any of these steps, she was regarded as having some knowledge of the event. 6 T.

The results of cued recall of autobiographical events in the special assessment for retrograde amnesia. The patient s performance was severely impaired for events during the past 30-40 years, without temporal gradient. The period tested was divided by decades into four phases from the 1960s to the 1990s; each temporal phase included the names of 16 well-known people, events or places. For example, in the first phase, the examiner presented the patient with the following four verbal items: tsuki-no-tou (tower for the moon) , sabaku-no-tettou (steel tower in a desert) , oka-no-ue-no-tawaa (tower on a hill) , and taiyou-no-tou (tower for the sun) . The target word was taiyou-no-tou, which is the name of a memorial monument of the Osaka International Exposition held in 1970. The pa- tient was required to choose one from these four words. In the second phase, the examiner asked the patient to elaborate on the meaning of the word or to describe whatever came into her mind in response to it. In the third phase, when the patient was unable to make any, association with the word, she heard the following four items: Exposition, Olympic Games, World Motor Fair, and World Cup Soccer. She was asked to choose the one she thought was relevant. The results of this test for public events are given in Fig. 3. The patient showed a surprisingly good performance in the selection of keywords related to an event, but her ability to explain the keywords she had selected was severely impaired; her recognition ability came somewhere between the two. This pattern extended over at least the past 37 years and did not show any temporal gradient. 3. 2. 3. Memory for autobiographical semantic knowledge The procedure in this task was the same as that in the Public Semantic Memory Test. First, the examiner asked the patient to select a keyword she thought she knew or was familiar with, from a set of four keywords presented verbally (recognition of a keyword of an event) . A set of four verbal keywords consisted of one related to a real event and three fabricated distracters. In the second phase, if the word selected was correct, the examiner asked the patient to recall information relevant to it (recall of relevant knowledge) . In the third phase, if the patient could not recall any relevant information, she was verbally presented with four words describing the personal event, one by one, including one target and three distracters. She was asked to choose a word she felt to be relevant to the event (recognition of relevant knowledge) . T.

The results of memory for autobiographical events in the special assessment for retrograde amnesia. The clear dissociation between preserved recognition of a keyword of an event and impaired recall or recognition of relevant knowledge of the event was observed only for the 1990s. 8 T. Tsukiura et al. | Brain and Cognition 51 (2003) I-11 The period tested was divided into four phases, each covering one decade from the 1960s to the 1990s. One temporal phase included eight sets of the names of people or places that were relevant to the autobiographical events. For example, the examiner first presented the patient with the following four words: tsutusjigaoka-kaikan (Tsutsujigaoka Memorial Hall) , miyagino-kaikan (Miyagino Memorial Hall) , haranomachi-kaikan (Haranomachi Memorial Hall) , and odawara-kaikan (Odawara Memorial Hall) . The target stimulus was miyagino- kaikan, which is the name of the hall where the patient s wedding ceremony was held in 1972. The patient was required to select one word she felt to be familiar. In the second phase, the examiner asked her to explain the meaning of the word or to describe any associated ideas that came into her mind. In the third phase, when she failed, she was presented with the following four verbal cues: her own wedding ceremony, a concert she went to with her daughter, her friend s birthday party, and a building to which she often went with her family. The results of this test are shown in Fig. 4. In this test, the patient also showed a preserved ability to select relevant words associated with personal events and an impaired ability to recall the relevance of the word she selected; her ability to select related items came somewhere in between. However, dissociation among the three tasks was prominent only for the 1990s and was less remarkable in other phases than it was in the test for public events. 4. Discussion The patient in this study showed severe amnesia for autobiographical episodic memory covering her whole lifetime, severe but temporally graded amnesia for au- tobiographical semantic memory, and severe amnesia for public events and famous people without temporal gradient. However, using the multiple-choice method, she showed a high level of accuracy in choosing a correct keyword related to a public or personal event, although this did not prompt her recollection of the event. Impor- tantly, these results indicate that, even with severe retrograde amnesia, memories of past events are not completely lost. The following discussion concentrates on this striking contrast between the preserved ability to recognize a keyword related to a past event and severe impairment in the ability to recall knowledge relevant to the event, even with a cue. In this paper, we use the term recognition to denote the correct se- lection of targets regardless of whether or not they are accompanied by their meaning. It has been reported that autobiographical memory can be disrupted without concomitant disruption of the recall of past public knowledge such as of social events or famous people (Dalla Barba et al. , 1990; Hodges & McCarthy, 1993; Evans et al. , 1996; Van der Linden et al. , 1996; Ross & Hodges, 1997; Venneri & Caffarra, 1998) . Warrington and McCarthy (1988) reported on a patient who was unable to name famous people from their faces and to choose a correct name from three famous names, but was able to identify the faces and names of famous people when pre- sented with a target and two unknown (unfamiliar) distracters. The finding that our patient was able to choose keywords related to past events from distracters is similar in this respect. However, in a later report by McCarthy and Warrington (1992) , their patient showed not only preserved name vocabulary, but also preserved information about personalities, despite showing no evidence of knowledge of the events asso- ciated with them. Therefore, the dissociation patterns identified in our patient differ from those of the patient reported by McCarthy and Warrington (1992) . Our finding indicates that, in retrograde amnesia, keywords related to past events can be rec- ognized without retrieving any knowledge related to the events. It should be noted that this ability shown by our patient differs from specific types of implicit retrieval such as priming because she recognized the keywords explicitly. T. Tsukiura et al. | Brain and Cognition 51 (2003) 1-11 How can we explain this type of dissociation in memory retrieval? One possible explanation is that the memory of an event consists of many component mental elements. An event may be stored in fragmented form, as verbal information, nonverbal events, and many others components. Normal recall of an event may only be possible when these components are recombined or reconstructed. In line with this reasoning, many authors have postulated the existence of a certain type of binding codes that connect multi-modal feature representations (Teyler & DiScenna, 1986; Squire & Alvarez, 1995; Damasio, 1989; McClelland, McNaughton, & OReilly, 1995; Moscovitch, 1995; Kapur, 1997; Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997; Mesu- lam, 1998; Fujii et al. , 2000) . The patient in our study was able to recognize a keyword related to an event but was not able to recall or recognize the relevant knowledge associated with it. In the present study, a keyword or the relevant knowledge related to the event can be regarded as one of several components that make up that particular event. To be able to retrieve the relevant knowledge of an event, it may be necessary to recover or remember details of the event from a pre- viously presented keyword through a process of connecting the keyword with its relevant knowledge, whereas the recognition of a single keyword may not involve this requirement to recover detailed information of the event. Either way, our pa- tient s dissociation patterns suggest that, even in severe retrograde amnesia, mem- ories for past events are not completely lost. The patient in our study had extensive lesions in the bilateral medial temporal lobes and surrounding temporal areas. Nevertheless, she was able to recognize correctly the keywords related to past events. Therefore, the undamaged brain re- gions (possibly the posterior association cortices) in this patient may be sufficient for her to recognize the keywords of past events. The damaged brain regions may play an important role in the retrieval of knowledge relevant to keywords related to past events. The patient reported by McCarthy and Warrington (1992) had extensive but smaller lesions than our patient in the bilateral hippocampal complex and amygdala, with more extensive lesions in the right hemisphere. The undamaged regions in their patient s left hemisphere may have been sufficient for the retrieval of some infor- mation relevant to the names of people the patient had identified. In the anterograde domain, Vargha-Khadem et al. (1997) reported preserved acquisition for semantic memory but not dren with early onset hippocampal pathol is necessary for episodic memory and t for episodic memory in three young chil- ogy. They proposed that the hippocampus he subhippocampal cortices for semantic memory. These observations indicate that there may be different neuroanatomical sub- strates for different processing levels. Thus, our patient s undamaged regions may have been sufficient for the recognition of keywords of an event, but insufficient for the retrieval of further information. For further retrieval of semantic information, the subhippocampal and surrounding temporal areas may be necessary; and for full recovery of the content with temporal and spatial information, the hippocampal formation itself may be required. There is a need for further studies on human amnesia, describing both psychological and anatomical details, in order to under- stand the roles of the different regions in normal memory and its disruption.

Memory improved partially within 8 months. At all stages the impairment was more severe for verbal than non-ver- bal memory. Autobiographic recollec- tions and newly acquired information tended to be disorganised with respect to temporal order. Procedural memory was unaffected. Both emotional involvement and pleasure in reading were lost. On MRI, the infarct was limited to the left anterior thalamic nuclei and the adjacent mamillothalamic tract. The regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (mea- sured with PET) was decreased on the left in the thalamus, amygdala, and pos- terior cingulate cortex 2 weeks after the infarct, and in the thalamus and poste- rior cingulate cortex 9 months later. These findings stress the specific role of the left anterior thalamic region in mem- ory and confirm that longlasting amnesia from a thalamic lesion can occur without significant structural damage to the dor- somedial nucleus. Furthermore, they suggest that the anterior thalamic nuclei and possibly their connections with the posterior cingulate cortex play a role in emotional involvement linked to ipsilat- eral hemispheric functions. (F Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1994; 57: 27-34) Lesions of the anterior and medial parts of the thalamus are often accompanied by mem- ory dysfunction. '* Bilateral lesions?*'* may produce major memory deficits that have sometimes been reported to last for several years. ?4 Unilateral lesions may also be asso- ciated with memory dysfunction which is usually less severe and persistent and may be linked to a selective field of memory. ?!*?? In particular, verbal memory seems to be largely spared after right thalamic lesions. '>'\" Conversely, preservation'*' or relative spar- ing of visuospatial memory after left thala- mic lesions has been reported. The lateralisation of memory dysfunction is, how- ever, not always present, and both right! or left?!>'722, unilateral thalamic lesions have been reported with global amnesia. Non-transient amnesia associated with uni- lateral infarct limited to the thalamus is uncommon. It usually involves the parame- dian!*'9 224 or polar!>? ?! territory. We report clinical, topographical, and sequential neuro- psychological and metabolic correlations in a patient with isolated infarct in the polar terri- tory of the left thalamus. Case report The patient was a 54-year-old, right-handed woman of Spanish origin, married for 30 years, with no children, and living for the past 27 years in the French speaking part of Switzerland. She spoke French well and worked in semi-skilled employment. From 7-23 July 1991, the patient and her husband visited their relatives in Spain. On their return flight, the plane passed through serious turbulence. At the time, the patient was greatly affected by this event. After her holiday, the patient returned to work and car- ried out her household tasks as usual. Waking on the morning of the fifteenth day after her return from Spain, the patient complained of seeing red. The following day, she became strange , kept asking the date, was found walking in her flat apparently without pur- pose, and seemed to forget what she wanted to do. While cooking, she put a handful of salt into an omelette, apparently without knowing what she was doing. She was weep- ing and felt that she was not behaving as usual. Nevertheless, when her husband arrived at home she easily recognised him. She was admitted the same day to the neurol- ogy department. She was not drowsy. A detailed neurological examination was nor- mal, including eye movements and motor and sensory functions. A brain CT scan, performed 1 day after admission, showed a left anterior thalamic hypodensity; no other lesion was visible. MRI performed 5 days later showed a gadolinium enhancing lesion, 1-1 cm in diameter, in the anterior part of the left thalamus; this lesion was compatible with recent infarction (fig 1) . When related to the map of thalamic nuclei, the lesion involved some of the anterior nuclei and the incoming part of the mamil- lothalamic tract, but spared most of the dor- somedian nucleus (fig 2) . The localisation and extent of the lesions coincided with the territory of the polar (or tuberothalamic) artery. No other lesions could be seen.

Clarke, Assal, Bogousslavsky, Regli, Townsend, Leenders, Blecic Metabolic studies The regional cerebral glucose uptake was studied 15 days and 9 months after the onset of the illness using 'F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) , and positron emission tomography (PET) . The PET scanner, a prototype con- structed by a research collaboration between Siemens/CTI (Knoxville, Tennessee) and Geneva University Hospital, used state of the art bismuth germanate block detectors and 31 transaxial sections of the brain were imaged simultaneously during a scan with a spatial resolution of 6-7 mm. The thickness of each section was 3-4 mm, covering a total of 10-8 cm of brain. The data were acquired and reconstructed using a SUN SparcStation computer with a fast SuperCard array proces- sor attached. Subsequent image display and analysis of regions of interest was performed using ANALYZE software version 5-1 (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MI, USA) . In each session, approximately 7 mCi of FDG were injected intravenously and arterialised venous blood (with the hand heated to 41 C) was sampled at regular intervals throughout the study. The first study consisted of a single 40 minute acquisition commencing 45 minutes after injection. For the second study, dynamic scans of increasing duration (starting immedi- ately at injection with five scans of 75 second duration each) were performed during the 80 minutes post-injection (a total of 13 time frames were acquired) . Attenuation correc- tion factors were calculated using an ellipse approximation for the head. Glucose con- sumption rates** were estimated from the PET scans performed 45 minutes after injec- tion, using a simple expression. At the time of the late scan, the '*F signal was assumed to come entirely from metabolised FDG which is irreversibly trapped. The regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate (fr CMRGlu) is then: rCMRGlu = Cg Ctissue (T) /[/dt Cp (t) LC] where Cg is the (cold) plasma glucose con- centration; Ctissue (T) , the tissue concentra- tion of FDG measured by the PET scan at time T; Jdt Cp (t) , the radioactivity in the plasma integrated from the time of injection to time T; and LC, the lumped constant accounting for differences in membrane transport and phosphorylation between FDG and glucose (here = 0: 42) . T is the mid scan time.

Arrows indicate the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus; note the relative hypometabolism on the left side. Fifteen days after the onset of the illness, a significant* decrease in glucose metabolism was observed in several brain regions (fig 3) . The average metabolic rate of the left thala- mus was reduced by 10-20% compared with the right, and 30-32% in its anterior and anteromedial parts. Since the metabolic rate of the right thalamus (36-2 wmol/100 ml/min) *Thirty one regions of interest were selected on horizontal or sagittal sections by comparison with the stereotaxic brain atlas. * The regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose were estimated according to the Sokoloff model, * variability within the regions of interest has been evaluated. The left/right ratios of metabolic rates in symmetrically located regions of interest were calculated; they had a mean value of 0: 90 with a 99% confidence interval of {0-832, 0-971} for the first scan and 0-94, {0-891, 0-995} for the second scan. Thus, a left sided decrease of 17% or more on the first scan and of 11% or more on the second scan were statistically significant with p< 0-005. appeared normal when compared with a global rate for grey matter (37: 1 umol/ 100 ml/min) , the side difference was more compatible with left hypo- rather than right hyper-metabolism. No relative hypometabo- lism was observed in structures near to the left thalamus (caudate or putamen) . Several regions known to be connected to the ante- rior or medial parts of the thalamus and/or involved in memory were analysed for left/ right metabolic differences. No major differ- ences in glucose metabolism were observed in different parts of the frontal cortex or in the hippocampus. The metabolic rate in the lower part of the amygdala region was, how- ever, 15% less on the left side compared with the right. The posterior half of the cingulate cortex (corresponding to Brodmann s areas 23 and lower 31) had a significantly lower metabolic rate, by 19%, on the left than on the right side; no such difference was observed in the anterior half of the cingulate cortex. The metabolic asymmetry in the pos- terior half of the cingulate cortex was not accompanied by a similar asymmetry in the surrounding medial part of the occipitopari- etal cortex nor in area 17. Outside the cere- bral hemispheres no marked side differences could be observed, except that the metabo- lism in the cerebellar hemisphere was lower on the right than on the left side. The second metabolic study 9 months later showed a global rate for grey matter (32: 3 umol/100 ml/min) which was 13% lower than for the first scan, based on the same simplified estimation method. Similar decreases in glucose metabolism between two successive PET scans have been reported in normal volunteers. ** At the same level of sig- nificance (p < 0-005) , the mean metabolic rate of the anterior and anteromedial regions of the thalamus was still lower (by 14-23%) on the left side, but less so than in the first study (30-32%) . While the global rate decreased by 13% between the two scans, the left anterior superior region of the thalamus increased by 17-3%, and the same region in the right thalamus increased by only 3-4%. The same extrathalamic regions were mea- sured and compared for left/right differences as in the first study. However, for this scan, no major differences were found between comparable regions on the right and left side, with the exception of the posterior cingulate cortex which remained significantly hypometabolic on the left side (16-9% less on the left than on the right side; fig 3) . Neuropsychological assessment ACUTE PHASE On her arrival in hospital, the patient could not tell the day, the month, or the year, but knew (correctly) that it was summer. She was roughly oriented in space. Sustained attention was affected; the patient was unable to recite the months in reverse, or to perform simple calculations. a The patient was unable to remember her profession, her date of birth, or 30 Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 14, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com Clarke, Assal, Bogousslausky, Regli, Townsend, Leenders, Blecic to evoke other old memories. She was unable to remember her holiday in Spain from which she had returned two weeks earlier. From a list of 10 words that were read to her three times she correctly repeated two, three and three, respectively. A careful neuropsychological examination, both in French and in Spanish, was per- formed from the 7th to the 19th day of hospi- talisation. The patient collaborated well and was attentive. During the first few days, she was slow, easily tired, and disoriented in time, but she always knew that she was in a hospital and found her way around easily. Her behav- iour and contact with the examiners was always adequate. Spoken and written lan- guage, praxias, visuocognitive functions, and spatial orientation were largely preserved (table 1) , with the exception of difficulties in naming objects and people. Verbal fluency was severely deficient, and non-verbal fluency was at the lower limit of our norm. Programming of alternating sequences and reciprocal coordination of hand movements were impaired. The patient also tended to persevere in certain tasks. Intelligence tests revealed a low average intellectual ability. Memory testing (table 2) revealed sparing of short term memory and preserved learning of new skills, but major deficits in episodic memory and in acquisition of new material. The latter deficit was always more severe for verbal than non-verbal material. Thus, mem- orising of 15 items, visual recognition of recurring items, and forced choice recogni- tion were more severely affected for verbal than non-verbal material. The copy of a com- plex geometrical figure*! was good, as was the immediate and delayed recall. Furthermore, the memory of the temporal order was impaired. Episodic and biographic memory was tested by extensively interviewing the patient and (separately) her husband on events that occurred during their married life.

The patient recalled well her early life and her wedding 30 years ago. Her major deficits concerned the year preceding her illness (fig 4) . The mem- ory of events that had occurred between the holiday in Spain and the onset of the illness was rather sparse in the personal domain, whereas some political events that had occurred during the same period were retained. More detailed recollections could be evoked from the stay in Spain and from both journeys. However, the memory of the tem- poral sequence of the events was often impaired. Details from the outward flight could be more easily evoked than those from the return flight, despite the dramatic passage through turbulence which marked the latter. Furthermore, a dissociation between memory of items and of the temporal order was appar- ent.

The black surface represents the proportion of correct and easily revocable memories; hatched surface vague memories which were often incorrectly set in time; and dotted surface memories that were impossible to evoke. During the acute phase, 7 to 27 days before the onset of the illness corresponded to the patient s holidays; 120 days to a change in employment; about 240 days to the preceding Christmas and New Year; and about 360 days to the summer holidays the year before. Note that autobiographical memory was more impaired for recent than for distant events. relatively in detail (age, hairstyle, some cloth- ing, profession, origin, reaction to the turbu- lences) the person who was sitting next to her on the dramatic flight from Spain and who was not known to her previously, she was not sure on which flight the turbulences occurred. The patient had changed work four months before the onset of the present illness. During the acute phase she was able to describe her former employment, remembered having changed jobs, but could not remember when and was very vague about her present job. She was unable to recall the name of her new employer, although she said (correctly) that she had lived for many years opposite the fac- tory, and remembered only vaguely that she had something to do with the laboratory. Compared with her husband, the patient remembered rather well what she had done the preceding Christmas (that is, seven months before the onset of her illness) , but was vague about events at New Year. She accurately recounted her holidays from the preceding summer. She gave an accurate account of some family ramifications and of her friends in Lausanne. She was, however, vague on the relatively recent illness of her mother. Several major political events could be evoked and more or less correctly placed in time. Autobiographical and public events that occurred more than one year before the onset of the disease were often remembered with imprecision. The role of the thalamic infarction in these imprecisions was, however, difficult to evaluate, since the husband, who served as a control, was not precise on that period. Famous faces from different periods (1940s to 90s) were readily recognised. Throughout this period, the patient could not recall, or has been uncertain about, many items from tests or events from her own life. Nevertheless, she never confabulated, and while she described some of her recollections as vague , she could never be induced into elaborating a story out of her vague recollec- tons. Pure amnesia after unilateral left polar thalamic infarct: topographic and sequential neuropsychological and metabolic (PET) correlations 31 FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE ONSET OF THE ILLNESS After her return home, the patient adapted relatively well. She was well oriented in her flat, and did not experience difficulty in find- ing objects. She was able to do washing, iron- ing, and even complicated cooking tasks on her own. She believed she had changed her personality, becoming less kind than before the onset of her disease, and no longer trusted her emotional judgment of other peo- ple. She reported a curious change in her preferences. A very keen reader before her disease, she has now lost all pleasure in read- ing, and indeed read only very rarely, a change which was evident to the patient s family. Conversely, the patient now enjoyed watching televison much more than before her illness. She also reported difficulties in commencing different tasks and often felt a lack of motivation. A detailed examination revealed good lan- guage functions (production, comprehension, repetition, denomination) , good visual gnosias, and good visuoconstructive abilities (table 1) . Verbal and non-verbal fluency remained poor. Reciprocal coordination of hand movements and movement sequences by the right hand were clumsy. The Stroop denomination was deficient because of slow- ness and naming errors. Tests of reasoning * were within normal limits. A test of sustained concentration was satisfactory, and reaction times to auditory and visual stimuli were within the normal range. Memory was investigated with tests similar to those used in the acute phase (table 2) . Some tests contained new, previously unused items, whereas others were presented for the second time containing the same items. The short term memory spans were within the normal range. The acquisition of new mater- ial was jmpairee, but more so for verbal than non-verbal material. The copying, immediate, and delayed recall of a complex geometrical figure (different specimen from previous one) were again good. The memory of the tempo- ral order was now within the normal range. The patient was very vulnerable to distrac- tion; a memory test containing an interfer- ence task (consonant trigrams) failed completely and provoked a panic reaction in the patient. Learning of new motor skills was preserved; the patient learnt readily to draw with the only visual control through a mirror. Newly acquired autobiographic memory improved, but was far from excellent. During this testing period, the patient received a visit from her sister and they were both inter- viewed separately on their activities during this visit. The patient s recollections were correct in about 50% of the events recalled by her sister, 20% remained vague, and 30% were either wrong or impossible to evoke. EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE ONSET OF THE ILLNESS The patient was now able to lead an indepen- dent life, to fulfil her household obligations, and to have a_ satisfactory social life. Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 14, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com Clarke, Assal, Bogousslavsky, Regli, Townsend, Leenders, Blecic Nevertheless, she experienced difficulties periodically. She felt sometimes unable to start certain activities. She was rather labile emotionally: on some occasions she was too emotive and on other, similar occasions, she felt an emotional freeze . She returned to work for 3 half-days a week; although her performance was on the whole good, she had a few instances of complete black-out . Typically, she would stand in front of a com- plex apparatus that she had used many times and could not remember what to do; there was no feeling of unfamiliarity. The loss of pleasure in reading persisted. The patient realised that she had become indifferent to choosing and buying clothes and shoes, which she enjoyed before her illness. She still could not remember the onset of her illness or much of the preceding holiday. However, she was able to differentiate between what she could remember herself and what she had been told later. A detailed examination revealed good lan- guage functions, good visual gnosias, and good visuoconstructive abilities; functions known to be impaired in frontal lesions were within normal range (table 1) . A test of sus- tained concentration was within the normal range. Performance on intelligence tests improved slightly and indicated average to low average intellectual ability. Memory was investigated with tests similar to those used in the two previous evaluations (table 2) . The performances were very much as they were 4 months previously. In-particu- lar, the verbal versus non-verbal dichotomy persisted. Furthermore, the patient was still vulnerable to distraction; an interference task (consonant trigrams) made memorising of simple items impossible. Discussion This patient had a sudden isolated memory disorder associated with a left polar thalamic infarct that was limited to the anterior group of thalamic nuclei, the incoming mamillothal- amic tract, and the anterior part of the inter- nal medullary lamina (fig 2) . The dorsomedial nucleus was mostly spared, but was probably partially deafferented. The pathway from the amygdala to the dorsome- dial nucleus is believed to be close to the mamillothalamic tract and was in this case likely to be damaged. The cortical afferents to the dorsomedian nucleus, however, should have been largely spared since they have been shown to arrive through the lateral, not the anterior, part of the thalamus. METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES Large unilateral thalamocapsular lesions and unilateral lesions limited to the thalamus are often associated with a decrease in metabolic activity of the ipsilateral cortex. ?!* * In large lesions, this decrease concerns the whole ipsi- lateral cortex, and in smaller lesions there is a suggestion of a topographic relationship; anteromedial lesions being associated with more pronounced hypometabolism in the frontal cortex. ?'** Interestingly, a similar topographic relationship is not apparent after bilateral lesions; bilateral paramedian thala- mic infarcts were reported to cause a (bilat- eral) diffuse cortical hypometabolism. * The small left anterothalamic infarction in our patient had fewer metabolic conse- quences. In the acute stage, 15 days after the infarction, the average metabolism was lower on the left than on the right side in the ante- rior part of the thalamus, the posterior half of the cingulate cortex, and the lower part of the amygdala. There were no major side differ- ences in any part of the frontal cortex, the hippocampal formation, or the striatum. In the posterior part of the hemisphere, the decrease of metabolism was indeed limited to the cingulate cortex (probably Brodmann s area 23 and the lower part of 31) ; no decrease was observed in the medial parieto-occipital cortex. After 9 months of evolution, the hypometabolism persisted in the anterior part of the thalamus and in the posterior half of the cingulate cortex on the left side; side dif- ferences were no longer observed in the amygdala. The hypometabolism in the ipsilateral pos- terior cingulate cortex can be well related to the lesion of anterior thalamic nuclei. Tracing studies in humans and in non-human pri- mates have shown that these nuclei have their main cortical connections with the cingulate cortex (for review see Van Buren and Borke?>) . There is also evidence for a topo- graphic relationship in these projections; in humans, lesions of the anterior cingulate gyrus caused retrograde degeneration in the anteroinferomedial part of the anterior nuclei, whereas lesions of the posterior cingulate cor- tex caused degeneration in the dorsolateral part. ?5 THALAMIC AMNESIA The patient presented impairment in long term anterograde and retrograde menor while short term memory (as assessed by spans) and procedural memory were pre- served. Bilateral?*\"* or unilateral right >!7?! or left? !* 22 anteromedial thalamic lesions have been reported to cause major deficits in long term anterograde memory, often accompa- nied by deficits in retrograde memory. Short term memory remained frequently within the normal, ?'7922, or lower normal?! range, although it was deficient following large lesions. When tested, procedural memory has been shown to be intact after unilateral' and bilateral infarcts. 7_ Autobiographical memory has been reported to be either pre- served' ' or impaired for recent events. ** After an initial period of global amnesia, our patient performed consistently better on non-verbal than verbal material (table 2) . This observation favours a moderate laterali- sation in thalamic memory functions. It is in agreement with similar sparing of visuospatial memory that has been reported after left anterior or paramedian'?' thalamic infarc- tions. Conversely, reports of largely spared verbal memory after right anterior >' or para- Downloaded from hittp: //jnnp. bmj. com/ on June 14, 2015 - Published by group. bmj. com median' thalamic lesions further support such lateralisation. However, there are also reports of durable global amnesia that is, a similar impairment in verbal and non-verbal memory, after left anterior?! = or paramedian as well as right anterior ! thala- mic infarcts. Two groups'*! observed that left lesions disrupt both verbal and non-verbal memory, whereas right lesions almost selec- tively disrupt non-verbal memory. Thus, evi- dence for the lateralisation of thalamic memory functions is contradictory. Factors such as size of the lesion or handedness of the patient may play a role and need to be com- pared in a more reliable way between the studies. After the patient partially recovered antero- grade memory (see testing at 4 and 8 months after the onset of the illness) she remained extremely susceptible to interference during memorising tasks. This type of deficit has been reported after right anterior thalamic, ! left paramedian, '*' and bilateral parame- dian ? infarcts. Temporal discrimination in anterograde and retrograde memory was impaired in our patient. Poor temporal discrimination in anterograde and retrograde memory is often present (and is a major symptom) in Korsakoff patients * and after frontal lesions. *'#? Past events are poorly dated fol- lowing transient global amnesia. * A left retro- splenial lesion has been reported to be associated with defective temporal discrimi- nation for anterograde, but not for retrograde memory. Impaired chronological memory has not yet been associated with exclusively thalamic lesions. It is interesting that in our case poor temporal discrimination in memory has been associated with left anterior thala- mic lesion and decreased metabolism in the ipsilateral posterior cingulate cortex. As described above, both structures are very likely to be interconnected and, as indicated by the case studied by Bowers et al, * this cir- cuit may play an important role in the tempo- ral ordering of memories. The performance profile of our patient resembles that described by Warrington and Weisskrantz, * namely, bad performance on multiple choice recognition, yes/no recogni- tion and story recall, defective memory of past events, and great vulnerability to inter- ference contrasted by preserved skill learning and adequate access to semantic and phono- logical knowledge. They have considered this type of amnesia to be due to a disconnection between a hippocampotemporal system deal- ing with semantic memory, and a frontal sys- tem dealing with cognitive mediation (or associative retrieval) . Both cerebral regions are known to be connected, either via the uncinate fasciculus or via the limbic circuit (temporal cortex entorhinal cortex para- hippocampal region hippocampus and subiculum-fornix -mamillary bodies anterior and medial thalamus-frontal cortex) . The limbic circuit has been demonstrated in non- human primates (for example, review by Amaral) and parts of it in humans (for Pure amnesia after unilateral left polar thalamic infarct: topographic and sequential neuropsychological and metabolic (PET) correlations 33 review see Van Buren and Borke?*) . Very small thalamic lesions, on the right?! or on the left (the present paper) , that were likely to disrupt selectively the hippocampo-mamillo- thalamo-frontal circuit, produced severe memory disorders. Our case supports further the important role of the disconnection between the temporal and frontal systems, since these systems seemed to function rela- tively normally by themselves, as suggested by the PET and neuropsychological studies. CHANGES IN EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT During the acute and chronic phase, our patient presented signs of frontal dysfunction, but less severe than those observed after para- median thalamic infarcts. *7 Several tests known to be impaired after frontal lesion were performed poorly during the first weeks of evolution but improved thereafter. No frontal-type behaviour was observed in every- day life or could be evoked during examina- tions beyond the first 10 days of evolution. Significant changes occurred in the patient s preferences and, to some extent, also in her personality, both of which were noticed by the patient and by her family. The most important change was that she became emotionally labile, varying between an exag- gerated sadness and tearfulness and emo- tional indifference. She was also prone to misunderstand the emotional content of her interactions with others. A lesser, but well confirmed, change was her loss of pleasure in reading that lasted throughout the follow up of 9 months. The patient read fluently and, 4 months after the onset of the illness, was able to recall a read story. Tests of sustained attention were then within normal limits. Thus, the loss of pleasure in reading was not due to difficulties in reading, attention, or remembering, but most likely to lack of emo- tional involvement in reading. This was con- firmed by the patient s statements ( This does not mean anything to me emotionally ) . The lack of emotional involvement was not generalised and did not include watching television, which was still experienced as pleasant. This means that not only memory but also emotional functions are likely to be lateralised.

A 62-year-old right-handed man presented with a sudden onset of headache to the hospital. On admission, he had a left homonymous hemianopsia, disorientation and recent memory disturb- ance, but had normal remote memory and digit span. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a subcortical haematoma in the right occipital lobe. These findings suggest that the patient s amnesia was caused by a lesion of the retrosplenial region in the non- dominant hemisphere. Introduction In 1987, Valenstein described a patient with amnesia associated with an arterio- venous malformation located between the splenium of the corpus callosum and the trigone of the left lateral ventricle [1]. He called this syndrome retrosplenial amnesia and suggested that this memory deficit was due to an interruption of an alternative pathway from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus. Following that initial description, additional cases have been reported [2-4]. However, in the prior reports, retrosplenial amnesia was caused by a retrosplenial lesion in the dominant hemisphere. Here, the first case of retrosplenial amnesia caused by a non-dominant hemisphere lesion is reported. Case report A 62-year-old right-handed man was admitted as an emergency to hospital because of the sudden onset of headache on the morning of 6 March, 1994. On admission, the patient was alert. Neurologic examination revealed a left homonymous hemi- anopsia. He had neither motor paresis nor sensory disturbance.

Therefore, on the 4th hospital day, a stereotactic evacuation of the haematoma was performed. A post-operative CT scan demonstrated total removal of the haematoma (figure 1b) . MRI 6 months following the haemorrhage revealed the cyst cavity in the right medial occipital lobe (figure 1c) . A sagittal MRI section showed destruction of the right lateral corpous callosum. Neuropsychologic examinations On the 10th postoperative day, neuropsychologic testing was performed (table 1) . The mini-mental status examination scale was 16/30. Digit span was performed successfully for up to seven digits, and word fluency (animal names) was 10 per minute. Aphasia, ideomotor, or ideational apraxia were not observed. Tactile nam- ing in the left hand was normal. Neglect of the left side was seen in line bisection, line cancellation, and figure copying tests. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) , the patient s verbal IQ was 92 and his performance IQ was 70. His full IQ was 75. These results demonstrated a mild impairment of intelligence, especially in performance. His memory function was impaired. On the Wechsler memory scale, all tasks were impaired, and his memory quotient was 75. On the Benton visual recognition test and auditory verbal learning test, both verbal and non-verbal tasks were dis- turbed. Table 1.

The patient s mini- mental status score and IQ gradually improved. Neglect of the left side also resolved within a few weeks. However, all evaluations of memory function did not show remarkable improvement. Discussion Valenstein [1] hypothesized that retrosplenial amnesia was caused by a lesion in the pathway between the hippocampus and anterior thalamus. Patients with retrosple- nial amnesia present with anterograde amnesia more frequently than retrograde. In fact, all previously reported cases demonstrated anterograde amnesia, and three cases also had retrograde amnesia [2-4]. Recent reports suggest that the retrosplenial region plays an important role in processing information involved in memory and learning [3]. Unlike the previously reported cases, this patient had a non- dominant retrosplenial lesion. Generally the destruction of the non-dominant retro- splenial region leads to topographic disorientation without amnesia. In this case, a topographic disturbance was not clearly present. This case represents the first report of a non-dominant retrosplenial amnesia. The authors hypothesize that a right retrosplenial lesion causes amnesia by a disruption between the hippocampus and anterior thalamus. A lesion of the pathway from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus in the dominant hemisphere impairs verbal memory. The interruption of this pathway in the right hemisphere also leads to a disturbance of visual memory. Likewise, Milner et al. [4] suggested, from a retrospective analysis of temporal lobectomy cases, that a left temporal lobectomy could cause a disturbance of verbal memory, but a right temporal lobectomy disrupts visual memory. However, the present case of a non- dominant lesion demonstrated a disturbance of both the verbal and visual memory. This observation suggests the existence of a close interaction between the right and left hemispheres in memory function. References 1.

She was unable to orient herself in novel environments and to perform learning spatial tasks both in real-world settings and laboratory conditions. Her ability to recall and navigate through known routes as well as to recognize familiar landmarks was preserved. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed similar neuropsychological and experimental pattern was observed 8 years later (at the time of follow-up) when she showed a persistent topographical disorientation and a slight worsening of verbal and visuo- spatial long-term memory disorders. Her topographical disorientation was characterized by an impairment confined to the anterograde memory domain, a not frequent pattern reported in literature, in the absence of remote topographical memory disorders.

V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Topographical disorientation (TD) is characterized by the inability to navigate through familiar or unfamiliar environments. Patients affected by this type of spatial disorder may not be able to recall familiar routes or to learn novel routes. In literature, different types of TD have been described and classified under two major categories [1-5]: topographi- cal agnosia and topographical amnesia, a dichotomy that remains somewhat unclear. Topographical agnosia (see for example, [6]) has been typically described as a perceptual difficulty to identify and recognize land- marks (places, buildings, landscapes, streets etc. ) . Topographical amnesia has been reported in patients with intact visual and spatial perceptual ability whereas memory for landmarks is impaired (for a review, see [7, 8]) . Also the neuroanatomical correlates are a matter of debate. Spatial deficits including TD have been associated with lesions due to stroke, traumatic injury, surgical treatment for epilepsy, encephalitis or neoplasia (with some exceptions, as the single case described by Iaria and colleagues [9] of a congenital brain malformation involving the bilateral retro-Rolandic regions, the case reported by Turriziani and colleagues [10] of a severe bilateral hippocampus atrophy and the * Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi: 10. 1016/j. jns. 2008. 06. 015 patient affected by focal Alzheimer disease recently described by Grossi and colleagues [11]) . The brain regions classically involved in the different varieties of TD are the parietal lobe (generally in the right hemisphere) , the dorsal occipital parietal pathway, the retrosplenial cortex, the medial temporal lobes [7, 12, 13]. More in detail, the contribution of the role of hippocampus in spatial processing has been emphasized by different neuropsychological studies [12-21] and confirmed by some functional neuroimaging studies [22-26]. In 1999, Aguirre and D'Esposito [1], on the basis on behavioural and neuroanatomical findings, proposed a detailed TD taxonomy considering four different categories. Patients affected by egocentric disorientation are able to perceive landmarks but show difficulty in representing the location of land- marks in respect to the self (for example, [27]) . Usually, the deficit is consequent to bilateral or unilateral right posterior parietal lobe lesions. Patients with heading disorientation are selectively impaired with respect to the direction to go from the landmarks they are able to recognize (for example, [28]) . Lesions are localized into the retro- spenial cortex-posterior cingulated (see also [29]) . A larger and well-studied group of cases with TD is that of patients affected by landmark agnosia, a deficit characterized by the inability to use salient environmental features for orientation [30-33]. The lesions involve cortical areas specialized in topographical representation: bilateral or right medial occipito-temporal cortex, including fusiform, lingual and parahippocampal gyri. All the above mentioned cases of TD are impaired both in familiar and novel environments. However, some cases of TD related only to 58 MLL. Rusconi et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 273 (2008) 57-66 novel environments have been reported and have been classified by Aguirre and D'Esposito as anterograde disorientation [10, 16, 34, 35]. The disturbance has mainly been attributed to a prevalent inability o learning spatial relationships by visual imagery and the critical lesion site was more frequently localized into the right hippocampus and parahippocampal areas. As we can see, the different studies reported in literature suggest that TD is a complex multicomponent deficit and the specific role o distinct neuroanatomical areas is, in part, controversial. In the present study, we report the case of R. G. who, when she was 22 years old, after a haemorrhagic lesion involving the right temporo- occipital region and the hippocampus, showed an impairment in memorizing environmental landmarks associated with an inability o' recalling the location of different spatial landmarks, in the presence o' a mild memory impairment. Furthermore, this case has provided us with the opportunity to perform a longitudinal evaluation of her clinical and neuropsychological deficits: 10 years after the stroke, the patient (who was 32 years old) revealed a persistent impairment o! the ability to find the way in new environments in the context of a long-term memory deficit. We believe our patient represents an interesting example of a long-lasting anterograde topographical amnesia with preserved remote topographical memory, in the context of a mild amnesia, also considering the extent and location of the lesion in brain areas (the right occipito-temporal region and hippocampus) involved in topographical spatial knowledge. 2. Case report In 1996, R. G. , a 22 year-old right-handed University student, suddenly developed an acute headache attack followed by a disturbance of consciousness. She was admitted to hospital where a CT scan revealed aright temporo-occipital haemorrhagic lesion with ventricular flooding. She underwent a ventricular-peritoneal valve derivation with conse- quent amelioration of vigilance state. During the year, the patient underwent neuroradiological investigations (digital angiography of cerebral vessels and Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI) revealing a small right arteriovenous chorioidea malformation and confirming the right occipito-temporal lesion. Therefore, a stereotaxic radiosurgery with Gamma Knife was performed. Neurological examination showed an incomplete left superior quadrantopsia and deep tendon reflexes slightly asymmetrical. At the time of hospitalization, a neuropsycholo- gical examination was not performed. R. G. referred a resolution of her mild memory deficit and persistence of TD. Three months later (1998) , the patient came to our observation for the evaluation of her topographical disorders and gave informed consent to participate in the study. We submitted R. G. to a complete neuropsychological assessment and to an evaluation of different cognitive abilities involved in topographical orientation (first evaluation) . Eight years after the first evaluation (2006) , persisting the topographical disturbances, the patient underwent MRI and neurop- sychological examination (follow-up) . 3. First evaluation (1998) 3. 1. Neuroradiological examination MRI scans performed in 1998 showed a haemorrhagic lesion in the right ventricular trigonal region with enlargement of the temporal ventricular horn (Fig. 1) . 3. 2. Neuropsychological assessment The patient was alert and cooperative, oriented in time and place (i. e. she knew the correct date/hour and where she was) . She was submitted to a series of neuropsychological test evaluating general intelligence, attention, memory, language, calculation, execu- tive functions and visuo-spatial abilities (see Table 1) . R. G. 's general cognitive level, by means of the WAIS-R, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised [36] and her scores in the other cognitive test were within normal range whereas she showed a mild impairment in the Short-story recall [37] and a deficit in the Corsi Supraspan Block Test [38]. The results confirmed the clinical impression: R. G. 's topographical deficits might be due to a memory deficit and, in particular, to a spatial learning impairment. Therefore, the patient was submitted to a more specific battery of tasks in experimental and ecological environments. We used a situated assessment approach to highlight the patient's everyday difficulties in managing known and unknown environments. 3. 3. Experimental evaluation R. G. 's performance in experimental tasks is summarized in Table 2. 3. 3. 1. Topographical abilities 3. 3. 1. 1. Wayfinding in familiar routes. RG. was asked to verbally describe, from memory, thirty-two different routes that she could take between two locations in her town, also by reporting strategies used in navigating (i. e. for some of the itineraries, she indicated a preferred route or provided an alternative route to be taken; she spontaneously described herself in a particular orientation at certain location points; she stated where a left or right turn would be made) and the location of landmarks (e. g. buildings, windows shop, cafe) . In sixteen conditions, she was asked to describe the route from her home to other familiar settings (e. g. from home to church, to bank, to supermarket etc. ) ; in the other sixteen trials, she had to describe the route from a location to another location in her town, each with a novel starting point and a novel end-point (e. g. from the bus stop to the restaurant) . The length of the routes ranged in distance from 150 to 1500 m and each itinerary included between four and ten turning points. Her performance was balanced with the descriptions collected by her parents and friends who confirmed that the routes were well- known and frequently travelled by R. G. prior to brain damage. The Fig. 1. MRI scans performed in 1998 (at the time of first evaluation) showed a haemorrhagic lesion in the right ventricular trigonal region with enlargement of the temporal ventricular horn. MLL.

She provided accurate descriptions of all routes, without any hesitation, thus suggesting a well-preserved retrograde spatial topographical ability. In some cases (4 out of 16) , she spontaneously described a possible alternative route. For example, she reported that to Maze number 4, F (2) = 10. 851, p<0. 001; Maze number 5, F (2) = 14. 652, p<0. 001; Maze number 6, F (2) =25. 341, p<0. 001; Maze number 7, F (2) =27. 806, p<0. 001; Maze number 8, F (2) =27. 806, p<0. 001) . The comparison between the performance of the patient and the controls (t-test) showed a significant difference in seven out of eight mazes (number 1-7) in which the control's group time in the first trial was higher than the patient's time but while the controls took advantage of the second and third trials, R. G. 's performance did not overall ameliorate, confirming her learning deficit (see Fig. 2) . 3. 3. 1. 3. Road Map test. The test consists of an A4 paper map on which a pathway is traced [50]. The patient was asked to image herself moving along that pathway and to report the left/right turns at each change of direction (for a total of 32 turns) . R. G. 's score was very good (30/32) matched to the control group (mean 23, SD 2. 1) . 3. 3. 1. 4. Navigational skills in ecological environments. | Two tasks of wayfinding in unfamiliar outdoor space (Hospital routes + route photos) were used in order to evaluate R. G. 's ability to learn new environ- ments. One of the task consisted in walking along nine different routes, all inside the Hospital campus (i. e. from the kiosk to the church, from the Hospital entrance to the cafe) in which the patient was accompanied by the examiner. In two subsequent steps, conversely, she was alone, followed, at distance, by the experimenter (who took detailed notes of the routes, by recording all left and right turns, her errors and hesitations) . During all routes, R. G. made several direction errors, she often stopped and looked around before proceeding and seemed to be very hesitant and never sure to be right. After the trip, some photographs of previously seen landmarks were presented to the patient who was required to put them in sequential order according to the routes she had previously followed. She was unable to do it.

Performance of the patient and the control group on the maze learning test (1998) . A second task consisted in a Map-based wayfinding. The patient was given a map of the Hospital surroundings on which a starting position (A) and a target position (B) were indicated. The names of the streets were cancelled (in order to avoid verbal aid) and R. G. was asked to walk from point A to point B. She performed this very well. Then, she was requested to repeat the same route (Route-based wayfinding) without the aim of the map. R. G. showed a clear difficulty to perform the task, she was unable to mention the starting point (Hospital entrance) and she made various directional errors (left/right turns) . Performance was scored by three independent judges on the base of accuracy. Comment on R. G. 's performance about topographical abilities. The patient revealed a great difficulty in learning new spatial information, both in ecological and laboratory tasks. Topographical retrograde memory was preserved. 3. 3. 2. Geographical knowledge and left-right orientation The abilities were assessed, respectively, by the Italy map test [38] and by Manikin's test [51]. In the first task, the patient was asked to indicate by pointing on a blank map the exact location of verbally presented Italian cities. Her performance was at a normal level (12. 5/15, cut-off=7. 5) . The ability to discriminate between left and right side was assessed by the second task in which the patient was requested to indicate on a manikin, drawn on a paper in 32 different rotated positions, the relevant location of left/right targets. Her score was 32/32 (control group: mean 31. 15, SD 1. 56) . 3. 3. 3. Visual topographical recognition The patient's ability to identify landmarks was assessed by four tests, submitted also to a control group of 20 subjects, matched for age (mean=24. 7, SD=1. 65) and education (mean=16. 15, SD=2. 7) . In one test (Buildings Matching) , the items were photographs of buildings in four different views. From the 20 items, 10 pairs of buildings were presented to R. G. who were requested to judge if the items of each pair were same or different . The performance of R. G. was at normal range matched to that of the control group (mean 19. 65, SD 0. 49; patient's score: 19/20; z= - 1. 32) . In the second test (Buildings Sorting) , five photographs of buildings from four different views (for a total of 20) were shown to the patient who had to collect together the photographs relative to each building. Score was 20/20 (similarly to that of the control group) . In the third test (Famous Places recognition) , twenty-six photos of famous places and monuments located in Milan (n=13) and of other Italian cities (n= 13) were presented to the patient who was requested to recognize them and indicate which of them were in Milan (where R. G. lived likewise the normal control subjects) . Score was normal (21/ 26, z=-0. 76; control group, mean 22. 7, SD 2. 1) . In the Buildings recognition test, three series of 20 photos of a building's front (eight targets+twelve distractors) were prepared. Eight target photos were shown to the patient: after, they were removed and represented among twelve distractors and R. G. was requested to indicate if each presented photo was previously seen (=targets) or not (=distractors) . The same procedure was used for the other two series of photos, for a total of 60 items. Patient's score (53/60) , compared to that the control group (average 58. 85, SD 1. 22) , revealed a deficit (z=-4. 79, p<0. 001) . Comment on R. G. 's performance about Visual topographical recogni- tion. R. G. showed a good performance in the above described building recognition tasks with the exception of the Buildings recognition test in which her defective performance could be heavily influenced by her memory deficit rather than to be referred to a pure recognition deficit. 3. 3. 4. Visual imagery Visual imagery was evaluated in terms of R. G. 's ability to retrieve and describe visual characteristics of objects. The Gordon's Questionnaire [52] is a visual imagery measure that examines the ability to image objects first in a canonical view (i. e. a car in a park) then in different positions which involves a mental rotation of figures or with different characteristics (i. e. colour) . The ability to modify the image is rated along a 5-point scale. Vividness Visual Imagery Questionnaire [53] consists of 16 items in four groups of 4 items in which the subject is invited to consider the image formed in thinking about specific scenes and situations and to define the vividness of the image. The vividness of the image is rated along a 5-point scale and has been associated with precision of outline, amount of details, brightness and saliency. Her performance to Gordon's Questionnaire and Vividness Visual Imagery Questionnaire resulted to be at normal level compared to that of a control group of 20 normal subjects, matched for age and education. The results obtained in the Gordon's Questionnaire were 44/50 (mean=39. 25, SD=6. 24, in the control group) and 65/80 in the Vividness Visual Imagery Questionnaire (mean=64. 9, SD=9. 03, in the control group) . Normal results were also obtained by our patient in tasks derived from Policardi and colleagues [54]. The tasks evaluate visual imagery in different ways (including topographical imagery, symbol imagery, animal and object imagery, and colour imagery) through comparisons of objects (patient score 20/20, controls: mean 18. 9, SD 1. 13) , salient characteristics of objects (patient score 19/20, controls: mean 18. 6, SD 1. 01) and topological and metrical relations into an object (respec- tively, patient score 15/15, controls: mean 14. 3, SD 1. 18; patient score 15/15, controls: mean 14. 2, SD 0. 60) . Imagery of words was tested by asking to R. G. to make spelling, forward and backward of ten words. Her performance was perfect (10/10 correct forward and 10/10 correct backward) . The patient was also submitted to a task derived from Vecchi and colleagues [55] and Luzzatti and colleagues [56] consisting in a series of matrices requiring passive and active visuo-spatial processing. In the passive condition, she was presented with series of 3x3 and 4x4 matrices with different numbers of black squares (one, two, three targets) in perceptual and imagery conditions. In the passive perceptual task, she was requested to judge the identity of pairs of MLL. Rusconi et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 273 (2008) 57-66 61 matrices and her performance was perfect (24/24) . In the passive imagery-recognition task, R. G. had to judge if the pairs of matrices presented in sequence were the same or different and she was perfectly able to perform it (24/24) . In the passive imagery-recall task, a matrix was presented and after a delay of 10 s she was asked to reproduce in a blank matrix the position of the black squares. R. G. 's abilities were well preserved (23/24) . In the active condition, the patient was asked to point out a pathway of different displacement lengths (three, four, five) in a blank 4x4 square matrix in front of her by following verbal direction instructions (left- right, forward-backward) . Her performance was perfect (18/18) . Then, she was requested to repeat a similar task by imagining the matrix and she was asked to identify the final square. Her score was 17/18. In Drawing from memory test, the patient was able to draw common objects, animals, a plan of her own apartment and the places surrounding her house maintaining scaling and spatial relationships among elements. 3. 3. 5. What and where memorization R. G. 's ability to memorize what is an object and where it is has been verified by a new task, consisting in 40 cards representing figures of objects. All the reversed cards were presented on the table; then, the examiner disclosed one card that the patient had to observe for 5 s; after this time, the card was turned over. The patient had to count for 15 s and then she was requested to report what was depicted on the card she had looked at and where it was located. This procedure was repeated three times, also with 2, 3, 4 cards. In two subsequent steps, the same procedure (with 1, 2, 3, 4 cards) was repeated modifying the interference task (to count for 20 s and for 25 s) . We quantified the responses according the two possibility, i. e. what was represented on each card and where each card was positioned. The task was also submitted to a control group of 14 normal subjects, matched for age (mean=24. 6, SD=1. 6) and education (mean = 15. 6, SD=1. 9) . In normal subjects, a repeated measures ANOVA (Time: 15, 20, 25 s; Task: 1, 2, 3, 4 cards; response type: what/where) showed a main effect of task (F=29. 195, df=3. 39, p<0. 001) , of response type (F=10. 732, df=1. 13, p<0. 006) , of Taskxresponse type (F=4. 328, df=3. 39, p<0. 01) and of TimexTaskxresponse type (F=2. 994, df=6. 78, p<0. 01) . The performance of normal subjects worsened as the number of cards increased and they revealed a better performance with what responses (mean=0. 94) than with where responses (mean=0. 83) . The comparison between the performance of the patient and the controls (t-student) showed a significant difference (p<0. 001) in 13 out of a total of 24 what/where responses. More in detail, the difference was observed with the presentation of two cards (with reference to two responses where and one what ) , with the presentation of three cards (with reference to three responses where and one what ) , with the presentation of four cards (with reference to three responses where and two what ) . Those results point out a significant difference between patient's and controls performance with reference to the increase of cards number (mostly with 3 and 4 cards) , and show how her performance in responses denoting the localization (where) was inferior to the what responses. Similarly to normal subjects, R. G. 's performance was better for what (mean=0. 77) than for where (mean=0. 48) responses but the number of her where responses was inferior to that of the control subjects. 4. Follow-up (2006) Eight years after the first evaluation R. G. performed a follow-up. MRI scans confirmed the previous lesion with an involvement of the right temporo-occipital area and hippocampus (Fig. 3) . The patient referred further difficulty in orienting herself in new environments: for example, she got lost and had to ask the way out to Fig. 3. MRI scans performed in 2006 (at the time of follow-up) confirmed the previous lesion: right temporo-occipital area and hippocampus. exit from a store or restaurant she had never visited before. She referred attempts to develop wayfinding strategies for novel environ- ments without any success. Otherwise, she referred she had no roblems when leaving her apartment and walking or driving through known streets if she paid attention to some landmarks. She relied eavily, for example, on street names, shop windows, commercial signs which allowed her to locate and orient herself perfectly in familiar routes, by referring to a preserved knowledge of the map of er town. She stated: When I go somewhere, even if I know the environments, | tell myself I'm going to pay attention. . . watch where I'm going, check the street names. . . so I feel myself more confident . She completed university studies although some difficulties due to er memory deficits that, in the last years, became more severe and forced the patient to take note many of things regarding her daily activities. In 2006 she was submitted to a neuropsychological and experi- mental follow-up. 4. 1. Neuropsychological follow-up The patient was cooperative and oriented in time and place. General cognitive level by WAIS and a neuropsychological battery consisting in a series of tasks similar to that of first evaluation were performed. R. G. 's neuropsychological profile was similar to that observed in 1998 except some tasks in which she showed results below the normal level with reference to verbal and visuo-spatial long-term memory tests (Short-story recall, Rey's 15 words learning task delayed recall, Rey's Figure delayed recall) . The performance in neuropsychological test is summarized in Table 3. 4. 2. Experimental follow-up Some of the tasks used in the first examination were submitted to R. G. (summarized in Table 4) . As for as topographical abilities, the follow-up performance confirmed the pattern of a preserved ability of topographical retro- grade memory and a difficulty to learn novel routes, both in real and in experimental condition. Tasks procedure were similar to that used for the first examination in 1998. 62 MLL.

In Wayfinding in familiar routes task she was asked to name locations and to describe the strategies for finding some different routes in familiar settings. Her performance, compared to that of two her friends, was accurate. An interesting observation is that she provided a more detailed description of the environments she learned to know prior to her lesion which were well-practised and frequently experienced than of known places more recently acquired and experienced (within 5-6 years earlier) . For the former ones, she reported also elements such as houses, shops, parks and so on whereas for the latter ones she provided a correct but more schematic topographical map describing only those elements which represent valid cues for navigation. In Wayfinding in unfamiliar outdoor space task, R. G. was invited to walk along unfamiliar routes with and without the aid of a map (Map-based wayfinding and route-based wayfinding) , with the only difference (respect to the evaluation performed in 1998) that the location was not the same Hospital in which R. G. was hospitalized in 1998. R. G. 's performance was scored by two independent judges on the base of accuracy and resulted to be very compromised. She made errors about left/right turns, she expressed difficulty in knowing where she was in the space with evident hesitations about the exact location. The Road Map test was submitted to a control group of 12 subjects matched for age (mean=30. 08, SD=2. 9) and education (mean=17. 5, SD=0. 52) . R. G. 's score was normal (32/32) matched to the controls (mean 22, SD 2. 3) . R. G. 's performance on the maze test was compared to that of a control group, matched for age (mean=30. 1, DS 2. 9) and education (mean=17. 4, DS 0. 5) . In normal subjects, repeated ANOVA measures showed a main effect in the time needed to complete the test in the three consecutive trials, in 7 out of 8 mazes, demonstrating a learning effect (Maze number 1, F (2) = 13. 937, p<0. 002; Maze number 2, F (2) = 3. 6, p=not significant; Maze number 3, F (2) =7. 736, p<0. 01; Maze number 4, F (2) =8. 663, p<0. 01; Maze number 5, F (2) =18. 687, p<0. 001; Maze number 6, F (2) =7. 828, p<0. 01; Maze number 7, F (2) = 10. 714, p<0. 005; Maze number 8, F (2) =4. 661, p<0. 004) . The comparison between the performance of the patient and the controls (t-test) revealed a significant difference in four out of eight mazes (mazes number 3-4-5-7) . The control group showed a clear learning effect across the trials while R. G. 's performance showed a remarkable difference with the normal subjects values in all experimental conditions. She was significantly slower than the normal controls with a peculiar peak in the second trial of the Maze number 3 confirming her attentive and memory impairment (see Fig. 4) . Geographical knowledge was evaluated through the Italy map test and it resulted to be at a normal level (12/15, cut-off=7. 5) . Left-right orientation ability (Manikin's test, R. G. 's score 30/32, control group: mean 31, SD 1. 6) and Visual imagery test (spelling forward/backward and Drawing from memory) were well performed. In Visual topographical recognition tasks, R. G. 's score compared to the control group confirmed a good performance in three tests: Buildings Matching (score=19/20, z=-1. 2) Buildings Sorting (score=20/20) , Famous Places (score =24/26, z=0. 8) . In the Buildings recognition test, she showed a mild impairment (score=54/60, z=-2. 5, p<0. 001) . What and where memorization task: in normal subjects, a repeated measures ANOVA (Time: 15, 20, 25 s; Task: 1, 2, 3, 4 cards; response type: what/where) showed a main effect of task (F=71. 455, Table 4 Patient's performance on the experimental tests (2006) Test Topographical abilities Wayfinding in familiar routes + Maze learning test + Road Map test [50] + Wayfinding in unfamiliar outdoor space + Map-based wayfinding + Route-based wayfinding + Geographical and left-right knowledge Italy map [38] + Manikin's test [51] Visual topographical recognition Buildings Matching Buildings Sorting Famous Places recognition Buildings recognition Dt et Visual imagery Spelling Forward + Backward + Drawing from memory + What and where memorization . - Impaired performance; + good performance.

The performance of normal subjects worsened as the number cards increased and they revealed a better performance with what responses (mean=0. 88) than with where responses (mean=0. 84) . The comparison between the performance of the patient and the controls (t-student) showed a significant difference (p<0. 001) in 9 responses out of a total of 24 what/where responses. More specifically, the difference was observed with the presentation of two cards (with reference to two responses where and one what ) , with the presentation of three cards (with reference to two responses where and one what ) , with the presentation of four cards (with reference to two responses where and one what ) . Similarly to normal subjects, R. G's performance was better for what (mean=0. 79) than for where responses (mean=0. 66) but the number of her where responses was inferior to that of the control subjects. Comment on R. G. 's performance about experimental tasks R. G. 's performance in 2006 resulted to be similar to that observed in 1998. The patient revealed a great difficulty in learning new spatial information, both in ecological and laboratory tasks, with a more evident attentive difficulty in performing some tasks (for example, the maze test) . Topographical retrograde memory, visual perceptual and imagery abilities were preserved. 5. Discussion We have described the case of a patient who showed a severe and long-lasting impairment in orienting herself in novel environments after a haemorrhagic lesion of the right temporo-occipital region including the hippocampus. The deficit in spatial learning was evident both in neuropsychological and experimental conditions, whereas the ability to recall and navigate through known routes was preserved, as well as her capacity to recognize familiar buildings and landscapes. As reported in the Introduction, few cases of TD resulted to be restricted to anterograde memory deficits [10, 16, 34, 35]. Usually, TD is observed in brain-damaged patients who are not able to recall previously known routes and to learn new routes (see [1] for a review) . Selective TD is rare and it has classically been divided into two distinct forms, considering a different basic impairment of perceptive or mnestic nature: topographical amnesia and topogra- phical agnosia. Topographical agnosia is defined as a type of visual perceptive failure to recognize the characteristic features of landmarks (places or buildings) . Topographical amnesia is observed with reference to memory deficits and can be divided into two subtypes: amnesia for landmarks and amnesia for spatial relationships. The former (see, for example, [33]) is characterized by a preserved ability in recognizing visual landmarks useful for real-world wayfinding (for example, street names and store signs) with an evident difficulty in recalling. In the latter case, patients are unable to recall the spatial location of different landmarks related to each other (for example, 2, 35]) . The present case shows a patient with a difficulty in learning the spatial relationships both in real-world and laboratory wayfinding tests. R. G's clinical evaluation and neuropsychological testing revealed a similar pattern of TD at the time of the first and of the follow-up examination despite the fact that her memory impairment resulted to be slightly different. On the neuropsychological evaluation performed in 1998, our patient showed a mild deficit in one test of verbal long- term memory (Short-story recall) and a deficit in one test of visuo- spatial long-term memory (Corsi Supraspan Block) . Other cognitive functions resulted to be unaffected. Eight years later (2006) , she showed a deficit with reference to verbal and visuo-spatial long-term memory tests (Short-story recall, Rey's 15 words learning task delayed recall, Rey's Figure delayed recall) , confirming her personal and our clinical impression of a slight worsening of attentive and memory functions, in the context of a good preservation of general cognitive functions. The analysis of our patient's performance in some experimental tasks can be particularly helpful in understanding the nature of her TD. A possible impact of visuo-perceptual deficits on TD can be ruled out by the observation that the performance on experimental evaluation was at a normal level in the visual recognition tasks (buildings, famous places, monuments) . On the other hand, the deficit reported in the Building recognition test, in which she had to recognize photographs of previously seen buildings, could be suggestive for a mild amnesia for landmarks rather than for a pure perceptual deficit. Our patient showed a clear dissociation between a preserved capacity to describe and follow familiar routes and a severe impairment of wayfinding abilities in an unknown environment, both in real (Hospital routes and surroundings test) and laboratory conditions (maze test) . Interestingly, the use of visuo-perceptive informations (a map) improved R. G. 's ability to follow a route in a real setting. In familiar wayfinding tasks, she was able to describe different locations by relying on a well-preserved mental representation of the environment, a cognitive map which allowed her to move from one place to another by following a known route. Even if we did not systematically investigate her ability to find an alternative route assuming that one main street was blocked off [21, 26] we may reasonably presume that such ability, in some routes, was preserved since she spontaneously referred an alternative route in her descrip- tions (see the example in the experimental evaluation) . However, from a methodological point of view, it is necessary to highlight a common problem in many studies: it is not easy to validate subjects reports of remote spatial memory. As suggested by Spiers and Maguire, 2007, page 8 [60]: Arguably the most intuitive and indeed ecologically valid way to probe remote spatial memory is to concentrate on knowledge acquired of real-world places and environments learned in the past. . . Thus, it is important to consider how such tasks are being performed Therefore, stated the difficulty descriptions made by our patient, by subjects. . . . . to have a control group, the yy memory or in real settings, were recorded and balanced by inde, pendent judges. 64 MLL. Rusconi et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 273 (2008) 57-66 Considering R. G. 's performance in the different tasks, we think that her TD can be referred to an impairment in learning spatial informations. One of the main finding is that she was unable to follow novel routes despite a good recognition of some landmarks along the way. For example, she was capable of recognizing photographs of previously seen landmarks along a way but she showed a severe difficulty in putting those photographs in order to reproduce the followed route. To assess the distinction between what is an object and where is it, we developed a visuo-spatial recognition test ( what and where memorization) . Once again in favour of our interpretation of R. G. 's topographical deficit, the results obtained by our patient, who showed a better performance with what responses, could be related to her difficulty in memorizing the spatial relationships. However, it is to note that her quantitative performance in this test was slightly different in 1998 and in 2006, although with a similar pattern. This could be referred to a more general worsening observed, at the follow-up, in the above mentioned three tests of verbal and visuo-spatial long-term memory. This is consistent with R. G. 's report that, 10 years after the stroke, her subjective attentive and memory deficits had worsened her daily life. She was independent in most of the common daily activities but she had to use some strategies to memorize different information, in the context of a persistent TD in unfamiliar environments. It is unlikely that R. G. 's TD could be primarily referred to as an imagery impairment since she performed all tasks very well. In the previously reported cases of patients with anterograde TD in the absence of a long-lasting retrograde TD, the role of the medial temporal region has been highlighted with a prevalent involvement of the right hemisphere [16, 34, 61, 62, 63] More recently, different studies of topographical learning have pointed out the involvement of a more diffuse network of cortical and subcortical areas. For example, the results obtained by Barrash and colleagues [12] underlined, in a large sample of brain-damaged patients, the relevance of medial occipito- temporal cortices (bilaterally) , the right infero-temporal cortex, the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in the learning of a complex real-life route. More in detail, the role of the right hippocampus and parahippocampus is still a matter of debate: according to the Authors, those regions are crucially involved in the consolidation of the topographical representation by integrating informations about landmarks and their locations (see also [64]) . The relevant role of the hippocampus in the formation and use of cognitive maps in humans has been established by different neuropsychological [12-21] and functional neuroimaging studies [22-26]. Some recent studies of anterograde and retrograde amnesia after hippocampal lesions have focused on the processes and neuroanatomical correlates implicated in remote spatial memory (for a review, see [60]) . Three different theories (cognitive map theory [65], standard consolidation theory [66] and multiple trace theory [67, 68]) may account for the involvement of the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobes in the acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory. Despite different aspects among these three theories, it seems clear the hippocampus is particularly necessary for facilitating navigation using detailed spatial representations [69], whereas the role of a more diffuse neural network, including parahippocampus, retrosplenial and parietal cortices, is still a matter of debate. Our patient showed a clear dissociation between preserved retrograde topographical memory and impaired anterograde topo- graphical memory, in the context of a mild amnesia. Her description of experienced environments can be considered as relatively detailed. She retained egocentric and allocentric spatial memory for maps of the environments and reported landmarks crucial for navigation but only in few cases she provided a more detailed description. Interestingly, at the follow-up, she revealed slight different qualitative descriptions of recollective experiences with respect to age of memories for places she had learned to know prior to her lesion. These clinical observations, together with the hippocampal lesion, seem to be consistent with the multiple trace theory [68], which posits that the hippocampus is necessary for detailed representations of remote memory (episodic) but not for schematic, remote topographical memory, sufficient for navigation (semantic) . The location of lesion together with other clinical and experi- mental findings allows us to underline that our patient differs, in some aspects, from other interesting patients reported into literature, such as patients E. P. [21], K. C. [70], S. B. [71], T. T. [69]. RG. did not show a bilateral lesion or diffuse atrophy involving the hippocampus and/or parahippocampus. She has a unilateral right temporo-occipital lesion, also including but not exclusively limited to the hippocampus. R. G. showed a mild amnesia but a severe anterograde TD while the other patients were severe amnesic or with a probable Alzheimer's disease (S. B. ) . Patients E. P. , K. C. and S. B. were studied with static tests while we used also ecological tasks and had the opportunity to follow-up our patient. However, R. G. can probably not be compared with T. T. , a London taxi driver, with a preserved retrograde topographical memory but an impairment on a task involving active navigation in London, evaluating with an interactive virtual reality London taxi. We have to acknowledge that we tested R. G. using environments that have a relatively less complex layout (compared to Toronto and, specially, to London) . It might be that in such environments the role of the hippocampus in R. G. 's performance was minimized (see [72] and [73]) . From a clinical and neuropsychological point of view, our patient is similar to the one described by Turriziani and colleagues [10] whereas the neural correlates are very different. Their patient showed a severe deficit in orienting himself in new environments in the context of a mild global amnesic syndrome following a bilateral hippocampal atrophy and represents an example of the involvement of hippocampus in the acquisition of new topographical spatial knowledge. R. G. showed a right medial temporo-occipital lesion including the hippocampus that could account for her topographical disorders and for her mild verbal and visuo-spatial memory deficits (particularly at the follow-up time) . TD may also be distinguished [74] between a form caused by the impairment of visual-object (landmark) representations, subtended by the what visual system (the ventral pathway passing through temporo-occipital regions) and a form caused by the impairment of visuo-spatial representations, subtended by the where visual system (the dorsal pathway passing through parietal region) [75]. This separation between neural correlates with regard to the identification of objects and the localization of objects was criticized by Milner and Goodale [76] and by Farrell [8] sustaining that both components ( what and where ) may be processed by both dorsal and ventral visual pathway although with different purposes. The ventral stream would be involved in perception and identification of spatial informations allocentrically ; the dorsal stream would be encode spatial informations egocentrically for the guidance of actions directed at objects in the world (see also [77]) . On the other hand, Aguirre and D'Esposito [1] claimed the difficulty to consider a unique neural correlate that could subserve both the identification of landmarks and their relative positions. As we can see, there is not a wide agreement in literature with regard to the neuroanatomical correlates involved in processing the functional dissociation between landmark information and position information, although the hippocampus seems to be critically relevant in associating objects and their locations. In our study, damage to the right ventral stream temporo-occipital cortex (and hippocampus) did not result in impaired landmark recognition. R. G. was able to recognize visual landmarks but she was unable to locate and to use them for navigation in new environments. This possible dissociation between what and where aspects of visual processing was also evaluated and confirmed by a new object-location memory test MLL. Rusconi et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 273 (2008) 57-66 65 ( what and where memorization task) in which she performed worse with where than with what items, findings that might be critically considered in the light of recent observations (for a review, see [78]) . In conclusion, TD is not a unitary deficit but clearly involves a variety of cognitive processes and distinct brain areas. As such, we believe the current study might also contribute to the debate on the role of neural correlates in the acquisition of new topographical spatial knowledge.

Knopman, MD 71-year-old woman with myelofibrosis on chemotherapy experienced an acute ill- ness with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Two weeks later, she developed an acute confusional state characterized by disorientation and fluctuating alertness with nor- mal speech and language. Her neurologic examination demonstrated an upper motor neuron pattern of right hemiparesis. She reported double vision though ophthalmopa- resis was not appreciated. Her gait was normal. While hospitalized, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Brain MRI revealed a small area of restricted diffusion of the left precen- tral gyrus (figure) . She was diagnosed with a stroke with secondary seizures; however, as the confusional state resolved, she developed profound retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Review of the brain MRI showed high T2 signal in the medial thalamus and contrast enhancement of the mamillary bodies; a diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome was entertained and she was started on thiamine replacement. The encephalopathy and hemipa- resis resolved though she remains severely amnestic. Wernicke encephalopathy often presents without the full prototypical triad of mental status changes, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, necessitating a high index of suspicion. Recurrent vom- iting or chronic diarrhea and cancer and chemotherapeutic treatments are predisposing factors.

        "case_report": "Observation Dissociation of Color From Object in Amnesia Armin Schnider, MD; Theodor Landis, MD; Marianne Regard, PhD; D. Frank Benson, MD A patient with persistent amnesia after bilateral medial temporal and left inferotemporo-occipital infarction could not match colors to objects in verbal, visual, or visuoverbal tasks. A severe naming disorder for objects was present but the patient could name colors and point to colors whose name was given. The matching disorder appeared to be a deficit in the semantic classification of objects rather than a problem in identifying colors. (Arch Neurol. 1992; 49: 982-985) ce appear to follow anatomically distinct pathways in the visual system, as do form, movement, and depth, and color perception can be disturbed separately. A mass of terms has been used to identify variations in color identification. Central achromatopsia, the acquired loss of color perception with preserved form recognition, indi- cates a lesion of the lingual and fusiform gyrus of the oc- cipital lobe. ? These patients, of course, cannot name col- ors. Color anomia has been used to designate an inability to name colors despite preserved color perception as evi- denced by correct color-color matching. The term is not precise, color anomia also includes an inability to point to named colors. * Color anomia has also been termed color- name aphasia. Color agnosia, as used by most authors, de- scribes the inability of patients with preserved color per- ception to name the specific colors of objects on verbal request (eg, what is the color of a tomato? ) or to color line drawings. *** Other authors have termed this disorder color amnesia and reserved the term color agnosia to describe an inability to select all colors of the same hue from a group of colors in patients who could still match colors and ob- jects. >\" In this article, color agnosia will be used to desig- nate an inability to indicate the specific colors of objects despite preserved color perception.

Descriptions of patients with disturbances in attributing colors to objects routinely describe color anomia as well. We present a patient with a global amnesia due to bilateral medial temporal lobe and left-sided inferotemporo- occipital infarction who could not indicate the color of common objects nor appropriately color line drawings of objects despite preserved recognition and naming of colors. REPORT OF A CASE A 66-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of sudden disorientation. He was a heavy smoker and had been treated for hypertension for several years. He had suffered two myocardial infarctions and had undergone three aortocoronary bypasses 6 years previously with good recovery. On the morning of admis- sion he was confused on awakening, could not orient himself in his bedroom, spoke incoherently, and complained of weakness of his right leg. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg and the pulse was regular. There was a right homonymous upper quadrantanopia and a moderate right hemiparesis involving the arm and the leg that resolved within a few days. A computed to- mographic scan showed a questionable left posterior hypodensity involving the medial part of the occipital lobe. Doppler ultra- sound examination showed nonstenotic plaques in the carotid bifurcation on both sides, while the vertebral and basilar arteries were normal. An echocardiogram evidenced an anterior myocar- dial aneurysm with mural thrombi, which prompted oral antico- agulation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging on the seventh day (Fig 1) showed bilateral media] temporal lobe infarcts. On the left side, the hippocampus, the parahippocampal, fusiform, and posterior inferior temporal gyri as well as the inferior aspect of the occipital lobe were involved. On the right side, a smaller infarct involved the body of the hippocampus and the anterior half of the parahippocampal and fusiform gyri. The patient remained severely disoriented in time and space, could give no account of his personal and medical history and re- peatedly asked the same questions about where he was and what had happened. The only people he recognized were his wife and his children. When he left his hospital bedroom for only a few seconds, he could not find his way back. He was friendly and co- operated fully in the examinations, but could not recall either the examiners or the events of previous examinations. Digit span was five forward and three backward for numbers and five forward and five backward for the Corsi cubes. His speech was fluent and correct without paraphasia. Repetition was normal. Auditory comprehension was good, even for syntacti- cally complex sentences. Long sentences could not be repeated and multistep commands executed to the extent the sentence could be repeated. Confrontation naming was severely impaired Color and Object Schnider et al Downloaded From: https: //jamanetwork. com/ by a Harvard University User on 12/04/2021 Fig 1. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Top, Horizontal sec- tions (TR 2000, TE 100, gadolinium enhanced) showing infarcts of the hippocampal area bilaterally. The lesion on the left side is much larger and involves the inferior temporal and occipital lobe. The medial temporo-occipital junction is spared; bottom, sagittal sections (TR 600, TE 15) of the left hemisphere. The most medial section shows no involvement of the medial temporo-occipital junction. More laterally, the infarct involves the inferior posterior temporal and inferior occipital lobe (arrows) . (see below) . In a sentence completion task (eg, a chair has four . . . ) , however, correct object names were presented in 18 of 20 cases. Reading was fluent without paralexia but comprehension was impaired as only the very last item was recalled. Writing was correct with both the right and left hand. Oral calculations of two-digit numbers and written calculations of three-digit num- bers were done flawlessly. There was no ideomotor apraxia to vi auditory v ming , '5 he immediately recalled y) two, two, three, four, and four of the 15 words in five trials. He recalled none after 5 minutes and cuing was not helpful. Of 10 drawings chosen from the figural learning test of Rey, '> he recalled only the last one on four trials and after 5 minutes, he re- called none. His recall of the correctly copied complex figure of Rey was zero. Retrograde amnesia was probed through an ex- tensive interview concerning autobiographic memory and knowledge about important events and famous people from all decades since his birth with the answers checked by his wife. He had some vague ideas of major events (eg, that Chernobyl was a bad event ) , but could not tell details or dates. The retrograde amnesia extended back to his childhood years and provided no clear time gradient except for the last premorbid year, for which even vague ideas were lacking. Naming to confrontation was strikingly deficient and indepen- dent of the modality of presentation. In the visual modality, only one (7%) of 15 line drawings of common objects could be named. In the tactile modality two (8%) of 25 common objects, in the au- ditory modality zero of nine environmental sounds, and in the olfactory modality two (17%) of 12 common smells could be named. Recognition was much better than naming as evidenced by correct designation of the use or characteristics of materials or by appropriate gestures indicating the use of objects, even though deficient for some materials (common objects, visual modality 67% correct; real objects, tactile modality 100%; environmental sounds 40%; smells 92%) . Color naming was largely spared (seven 170%] of 10) and color recognition was normal (100% of named. colors recognized) . Photographs of family members were cor- rectly named (eight [100%] of eight) but famous people (politi- cians and movie stars) could not be named at all (zero of six) and were only occasionally recognized (two [33%] of six) . Finally, he Arch Neuro! Vol 49, September 1992 After 6 Months 1 to 4 Weeks After 4 Months Flower Fig 2. Fxamples of drawings on command, which the patient per- formed within the first 4 weeks after stroke, and after 3 and 6 months. The drawing of a flower improved and is recognizable after 6 months. Drawings of animals show only slight improvement with more details. correctly named places within his own home displayed on pho- tographs (seven [88%] of eight; 100% recognized) , while he could rarely name and recognize photographs of famous Swiss sites (five [36%] of 14; 50% recognized when tested 3 months after stroke) . Color Tests Color perception was preserved as evidenced by a normal per- formance on the 16 hue Farnsworth Color Perception Test and mostly, colors could be named (70%) . The patient had no difficul- ties pointing to the color whose name was given within an array of 10 color chips or to match color chips with each other. How- ever, when given the name of an object like fruit or animals with typical colors he named the wrong color in four (50%) of eight cases. For example, he indicated brown as the color of a banana or red as the color of the sky without clouds. His performance was equally deficient when he had to point to the chip with the color typical of an object whose name was given (three [43%] of seven correct) . His performance was even worse when he was re- quested to color line drawings of common scenes or objects (one [14%] of seven correct) , all of which he seemed to recognize rea- sonably precisely as estimated from his description of the mean- ing of the drawings. For example, he chose dark green as the color of a banana, brown for strawberries, and yellow for the sky. He had considerable difficulties producing line drawings of common objects; even though the object s category was mostly recogniz- able, details were either lacking or wrong and the drawings were strongly simplified (Fig 2) . For example, a dog was recognizable as an animal but lacked the legs. Course Over the following 6 months, the amnesia persisted and the patient remained entirely dependent on his wife. He did not re- member any event occurring after his stroke. The retrograde am- nesia remained practically complete. Naming improved slightly for several categories (common objects, visual 36%; real objects, tactile 29%, environmental sounds 54%, common smells 25%) , and the pattern of better preserved naming of colors (100% by 3 months, 71% at 6 months) , familiar persons (100% as opposed to 0% of famous people) and familiar places (88% as opposed to 36% of famous places) persisted. Visual recognition of common objects normalized (100% correct) . The performance in color name-object name matching improved, so that he could indicate the color of common objects in eight (72%) of 11 cases. Drawings of common Color and Object Schnider et al 983 Downloaded From: https: //jamanetwork. com/ by a Harvard University User on 12/04/2021 objects were slightly better but still deficient. For example, he drew a clock correctly but put the numbers in the anticlockwise direction. COMMENT This patient with global amnesia following a bilateral medial temporal lobe and left-sided occipital infarct pre- sented with an unusual disorder of the handling of colors. Even though he perceived colors, could name them, and could point to colors named by the examiner, he failed to attribute colors to objects in verbal, nonverbal, and cross- modal tasks. He had a deficit in visual imagery. To our knowledge, only Engerth published a case with a some- what related dissociation of color and form of objects de- spite preserved color naming and recognition. This patient suffered from an amnestic aphasia and alexia due to a stroke. Even though he could name all colors, he did not spontaneously use the blue color when coloring line drawings or copying colored drawings after a delay. However, he would use the blue color when immediately copying drawings. This behavior might have been due to a color perception deficit, a partial central achromatopsia, as this tends to involve the blue and yellow axes while red is relatively spared. In our patient, however, a primary defect of color perception was excluded on the basis of a normal performance in color matching and in the 16 hue Farnsworth Color Perception Test. Lewandowsky\" attributed the dissociation of color and form to color anomia. In his opinion colors are meaningful only if associated with an object ( What should be the meaning of red if I cannot recognize it as the color of a cherry or blood? ) . In this sense a color-naming disorder readily explains a disturbance of attributing a color to an object. Lewandowsky s opinion is shared by Damasio et al who observed patients with color anomia making er- rors when coloring line drawings. They might first choose the correct color pencil, then aloud give it a wrong verbal label and on the basis of this error choose another color. Damasio et al consider color agnosia a consequence of color anomia. However, patients with color anomia can usually match colors to objects if the task is not cross- modal, ie, if it is verbal (answers to questions about the color of objects) or visual (coloring line drawings) . ** It seems that an additional factor is involved in color agno- sia. It has been considered a disorder of the concept of color-object association, or a memory problem in which the patient has forgotten the color of objects, \" or a true agnosia in which a patient can perceive colors but cannot appreciate the meaning of colors. '* Recent studies have indicated that color agnosia is not a precise disorder; patients with color agnosia may differ in performance de- pending on the imagery demands of the task, and it has been suggested that color agnosia can result from a disturbed access to the color lexicon or from an imagery disturbance. It is difficult to attribute our patient's inability to asso- ciate colors with objects to color agnosia as he named colors. His amnesia offers another explanation. In addition to the complete anterograde amnesia, the patient had a se- vere disturbance of the semantic memory or memory for facts, * evident in the anomia, deficient visual imagery, and partial recognition defect. Even though not aphasic he had a severe anomia for materials presented in all modal- ities, and he often failed to recognize the material. In ad- dition, a visual imagery problem was evident in his line 984 Arch Neurol Vol 49, September 1992 drawings that were grossly simplified and lacked details. These defects suggest a disorder concerning the classifica- tion of objects. On the other hand, the naming and recog- nition of colors were exceptionally well preserved. We conjecture that our patient s inability to attribute colors to objects was a disorder of the identification and semantic classification of objects, not a disorder of color processing. This assumption is supported by the observation that the dissociation of colors and objects faded as the visual rec- ognition of objects normalized and visual imagery im- proved. What lesion might be responsible for this disorder? Color agnosia has not been reported as a feature of amne- sia due to pure medial temporal lobe lesions, eg, bilateral hippocampectomy. Thus, the bilateral medial temporal infarct of our patient, which accounts for the complete an- terograde amnesia, does not appear to explain the disor- der. Our patient also had a left-sided inferotemporo- occipital lesion. Cirillo et al, on the basis of inferotemporal cooling experiments in animals, do not be- lieve that the inferotemporal cortex acts as a storage site for visual information. But animals with inferotemporal le- sions do have difficulty discriminating between visual stimuli, a problem that seems to be due to an inability to simplify the perception of a stimulus, ie, to categorize it, to such a degree that it can be precisely identified. Such a disturbance could also account for our patient s problem in associating colors to objects. 5 ? We surmise that the left- sided inferotemporo-occipital extension of our patient's infarct was responsible for his disorder in color-form asso- ciation. Finally, why did this patient not have color anomia or alexia? Patients with Potzl syndrome, ie, alexia and color anomia, have lesions that prevent information transfer from the visual areas of both hemispheres to the language areas in the left hemisphere, specifically the angular gyrus. *>? The lesion in our patient did not extend dorsally to prevent information transfer to the angular gyrus nor involve the splenium. Mohr et al ! presented a patient with color anomia without alexia whose lesion involved not only the parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus but also the left lingual gyrus in the mesial temporo-occipital junction. The area of the mesial temporo-occipital junction was spared in our patient. Preservation of mesial temporo- occipital cortex is consistent with our patient s preserva- tion of color naming, a conclusion agreeing with Damasio and Damasio s suggestion that lesions causing color anomia involve the mesial occipitotemporal junction. In summary, a patient with a global amnesia due to bi- lateral medial temporal lobe and left-sided inferotemporo- occipital infarction could not associate colors with objects but could name colors. The disorder is interpreted as a deficit in the semantic classification of objects rather than colors. The responsible lesion seems to lie in the infer- otemporal cortex. This study was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Sci- ence Foundation to Dr Schnider. References 1. Livingstone M, Hubel D.

In previously reported cases of amnesia associated with damage in the basal forebrain, multiple neuroanatomical regions were damaged, and the critical lesion responsible for amnesia has not been identified clearly. We report a patient who developed prima- rily anterograde amnesia after clipping of an unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed a discrete lesion, centring in the right diagonal band of Broca and including the anterior hy- pothalamus, septal nucleus, lamina ter- minalis, and paraterminal gyrus, and an indiscrete patchy lesion in the corre- sponding area on the opposite side. The nucleus basalis of Meynert was minimally affected and the diencephalon was not damaged. Single photon emission com- puted tomography showed marked hypop- erfusion in the midline frontobasal region corresponding to the MRI lesion and hypoperfusion in the hippocampus bilat- erally. It is concluded that disconnection of the pathway between the diagonal band of Broca and the hippocampus contrib- uted to memory impairment. ( Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1998; 65: 126-130) Keywords: diagonal band of Broca; amnesia; time tagging The amnesic syndrome has been found in patients with relatively discrete lesions in several cerebral sites including (a) the medial temporal lobes including the hippocampus, (6) median thalamic nuclei, (c) anterior thalamic nuclei, (d) basal forebrain, (e) fornix, (f) mam- millary bodies, and (g) retrosplenial cortex. '* The basal forebrain has been considered to contribute to memory function by way of the pathways between nuclei of the diagonal band or the septal nucleus and the hippocampal region, thus providing a cholinergic input to the hippocampus. * In most previously re- ported cases of amnesia*\"* associated with basal forebrain lesions, multiple neuroanatomi- cally identified areas were damaged, and it has been difficult to identify the minimal lesion necessary to produce an amnesic syndrome except for patients in whom basal forebrain lesions were relatively well circumscribed. ** We describe a patient who developed antero- grade amnesia as the result of a discrete lesion in the basal forebrain after clipping of an unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Case report A 61 year old right handed high school teacher, who had taught science for more than 35 years and had had good memory function, experi- enced a sudden onset of weakness in the right upper and lower limbs in July 1993, but recov- ered the next day. He was admitted to a hospi- tal elsewhere and underwent MRI, which showed a small haemorrhage in the left external capsule. He underwent cerebral angi- ography, which showed an aneurysm 5 mm in diameter in the anterior communicating artery. He underwent surgical clipping of the aneu- rysm one month later. Immediately after the surgery, he developed disorientation and agita- tion. Although he became alert and oriented to person and place one month after the opera- tion, he remained disoriented to date. He apparently had memory impairment at that time, but the details are not known to us. He had no motor or sensory deficits. He visited the neurology outpatient service of the Osaka University Hospital four months after the operation. He was alert and did not have any focal neurological deficits. He did not seem to appreciate the graveness of his memory impairment. His language comprehension and expression were intact. He could repeat seven digits and perform serial subtraction without difficulty. He could learn five objects but could recall only one of them after five minutes. Dur- ing the interview, his recall was aided by cuing. Recall of his remote personal history was rela- tively preserved but the dates were mixed up, and he mistook recent personal episodes as remote ones.

Memory for past public events was examined using the method described by Fukatsu et al ? and was within the normal range for the 1950s to the 1980s. He showed a limited period of retrograde amnesia for events before his operation. With the help of his fam- ily, a list for personal autobiographical memory was constructed with questions about signifi- cant personal events (for example, marriage, death, children s accomplishments) . Although he could recall almost all events, he could not tag these events in sequence. Follow up assessment He was assessed in February 1996, 30 months after surgery. He showed mild improvement in memory performance, predominantly in non- verbal memory (tables 1 and 2) . Immediate and delayed recall of the Benton visual retention test fell within the normal range. Although his verbal memory quotient on the WMS-R increased from 69 to 82, it remained impaired compared with his non-verbal memory quotient of 108. He achieved normal maximal learning of a word list learning task, but he continued to show severely impaired delayed recall. On memory for past public events and personal autobiography, he could recall each event fairly well. However, he could not arrange these events in sequence and mis- took the latest event for one having occurred years before. NEUROIMAGING EXAMINATION Brain MRI with a 1. 5 Tesla superconducting system (General Electric) , disclosed a small discrete lesion in the basal forebrain slightly to the right of the midline in February 1996 (fig 1) . Mapping of the lesion by superimposing on two schematic coronal sections from the Haines neuroanatomical atlas indicated that the lesion was in the basal forebrain including jyBuAdoo Aq payoajolq ysanb Aq 1Z0z ZZ JOQWIAAON UO /WOd'fwug'duuly/: dyy Woy pepeojumog g66l Ainr | uo gzt\"1\"gg'duul/ge| LOL Se pausiiqnd ysuy : AuyelyoAsy Binsounayn [ouneN Pr Amnesia after a discrete basal forebrain lesion the diagonal band of Broca, septal nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, and the lamina termi- nalis (fig 2) . There was an indiscrete patchy lesion in the corresponding area on the opposite side on the T2 weighted image (fig 2) but this lesion was identified on only one slice. The involvement of the nucleus basalis of Meynert was minimal and neither the medial temporal lobe nor diencephalon was damaged. The orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex were also spared. The appearance of the lesion on the right side indicated the presence of hemosiderin deposition. Single photon emis- sion computed tomography (SPECT) using * =Tc-d, I-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime showed an area of hypoperfusion, below 40% of the maximal isotope uptake in the cerebel- lum, in the midline frontobasal region expand- ing to both sides corresponding to the lesion on the MR image (fig 3) . In addition, the isotope uptake in the hippocampus was below 50% of the maximal isotope uptake in the cerebellum bilaterally, but slightly more reduced on the left side (fig 3) . Discussion In summary, our patient showed (a) antero- grade amnesia, (b) mild retrograde amnesia for both semantic and personal episodic infor- mation, (c) benefit from cuing, and (d) defects in the temporal tagging of information. The clinical presentation was similar to the previ- ously reported cases of amnesia after damage to the basal forebrain and adjacent structures. '* As reviewed previously, those cases were mostly associated with a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. However, previously reported cases '* did not have such a discrete lesion in the basal forebrain as our patient, whose anterior communicating artery aneurysm was unrup- tured. Our patient could learn test items in the memory evaluation batteries, but he had difficulty in recall and could not develop a proper time sequence for this information even when he could recall. This was striking and was different from memory impairment described in patients HM and DRB, whose failures were in learning both types of information. * The availability of contextual memory is thought to depend on the recording of separate infor- mation that is composed of a perceived episode, computation, and recoding of the relation between multiple components, and time tagging of this information. Despite his ability to learn information correctly, our patient showed difficulty in his daily living. This may be due to the difficulty in forming time tagging of this information. Because cuing markedly improved recall and recognition of both anterograde and retrograde memories, his amnesia with preserved cuing may be due to a deficit in retrieval. This notion was supported by the clinical finding and the result of the Rey s auditory verbal learning test. It is difficult to ascertain the minimal lesion necessary to cause the amnesic syndrome asso- ciated with a basal forebrain lesion, because of the extent and variability of the previously 129 reported lesions. There are only two patients in the literature who had a relatively well circum- scribed lesion. **? Damasio et al described a patient (case 1) who had haematomas in the left gyrus rectus and midline septal nuclei, who subsequently underwent surgical clipping of the ruptured left anterior cerebral artery aneu- rysm. The extent of the lesion was delineated by CT. Another patient described by Morris et al had a low grade glioma near the posterior extent of the right gyrus rectus involving the lamina terminalis and developed severe amne- sia postoperatively. Postoperative MRI showed a discrete lesion involving the right diagonal band of Broca, preoptic area, anterior hypotha- lamus, lamina terminalis, and paraterminal gyrus. There are some similarities and dissimi- larities among these two cases and ours. Damasio et al found a mismatch between auditory-verbal and non-verbal memories as we did. On the other hand, the patient described by Morris et al had a lesion predomi- nantly on the right side, but did not have such a mismatch. Our patient also had a lesion mostly to the right of the midline on MRI, but possessed an area of profound hypoperfusion in the midline frontobasal region expanding to both sides on SPECT. He showed better performance on the non-verbal memory examination than the verbal one. As the projection of the diagonal band to the hippoc- ampus is predominantly ipsilateral, his lesion should have affected the projection to the right hippocampus. He showed complete right handedness by the handedness inventory and had no family history of left handedness or childhood events that might be associated with anomalous lateralisation of cognitive function. At the present time, there is no clear explana- tion for better performance on the non-verbal memory examination despite the more exten- sive lesion in the right basal forebrain on MRI examination. One possibility is that the left hippocampus was functionally more impaired in our patient, as the SPECT examination sug- gested. Another possibility is the presence of hemispheric asymmetry for retrieval of epi- sodic memory. According to Tulving et al, there was increased blood flow in the right prefrontal cortex at the time of retrieval of episodic memory. They concluded that the left pre- frontal cortex was more involved in retrieval of episodic memory. Although their finding was confined to the cerebral cortex, it is possible that the retrieval of information may involve the pathway from the basal forebrain to amygdala or hippocampus and then to the pre- frontal cortex, and time tagging of information may be more reflected in verbal or episodic memory. Further case analyses would be necessary to confirm or rule out this possibility. Summarising these three patients who had discrete lesions in the basal forebrain, the criti- cal anatomical lesion may be confined to the nuclei of the diagonal band. Although other possibilities cannot be entirely dismissed, the primary underlying aetiology of amnesia re- sulting from a lesion in the basal forebrain thus seems to be disconnection of the critical bidirectional connections between the nuclei of jyBuAdoo Aq payoajolq ysanb Aq 1Z0z ZZ JOQWIAAON UO /WOd'fwug'duuly/: dyy Woy pepeojumog g66l Ainr | uo gzt\"1\"gg'duul/ge| LOL Se pausiiqnd ysuy : AuyelyoAsy Binsounayn [ouneN Pr 130 the diagonal band and the hippocampus. This idea is supported by the result of SPECT showing a lesion in the basal forebrain and reduction of blood perfusion in the hippocam- pus bilaterally. It is also possible that amnesia caused by a lesion in the basal forebrain with interference of the medial temporal function may develop impairment in the time tagging of information. We obtained written informed consent to report on this patient. 1 Aaral DG. Memory anatomical organisation of candidate brain regions. In: Mountcastle FP, Geiger SR, eds. Handbook of physiology.

Hypothalamic and basal forebrain germinoma presenting with amnesia and hyperphagia. Surg Neurol 1989; 31: 228-33. Patients harboring primary intracranial germinomas usu- ally have had Parinaud s syndrome and hydrocephalus (with pineal tumors) or hypopituitarism, visual loss, and diabetes insipidus (with suprasellar tumors) at presenta- tion. The few reported cases of verified intraparenchymal hypothalamic germinomas all have been in prepubertal males with progressive neurologic deficits, altered levels of consciousness, or clinically apparent panhypopituita- rism. The subject of this report was an endocrinologically normal, primiparous 24-year-old woman who presented with hydrocephalus followed by worsening anterograde amnesia and hyperphagia despite having a functioning ventriculoatrial shunt. Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an ante- rior hypothalamic, thalamic, and basal forebrain mass, which stereotactic biopsy proved to be a germinoma. Intraaxial germinomas restricted to the anterior hypo- thalamus or thalamus rarely have been reported. The clinical features of the current patient may be unique. KEY WORDS: Germinoma; Germ cell tumor; Hypothalamus; Stereotactic technique Primary intracranial germinomas account for less than 1% of brain tumors in reported series outside Japan [1]. In that country, the relatively high incidence of pineal region neoplasms (4%) includes a significant proportion of germinomas. Pineal region germinomas usually cause symptoms and signs of hydrocephalus and Parinaud s syndrome [6, 11, 15, 17]. Less common are suprasellar germinomas, which manifest with the clinical triad of anterior pituitary insufficiency, visual loss, and diabetes insipidus (DI) [11, 15, 23].

We recently treated a patient with a primary septal area, hypothalamic, and thalamic germinoma whose predominant neurologic deficit was a profound loss of recent memory. To our knowledge, she is the first reported patient with a histologically verified intraparenchymal hypothalamic germinoma having this clinical presentation. Case Report A 24-year-old left-handed woman sought medical atten- tion in June 1984 for constant bilateral frontotemporal headaches associated with nausea, photophobia, and visual obscurations. Prescribed analgesics were ineffec- tive, and in late July 1984, that patient went to a local emergency room where papilledema was noted. Upon admission to the hospital later that day, she did not recall going to the emergency room. Aside from papil- ledema and amnesia, no other abnormalities were de- tected on physical or neurological examination. Com- puted tomography (CT) scans (Figure 1) with and without intravenous contrast administration showed hydrocephalus, loss of the convexity sulcal pattern, and near obliteration of the third ventricle by diffuse bilat- eral expansion of the thalamus and hypothalamus. No contrast enhancement or discrete lesion was seen. Cere- bral angiography showed only hydrocephalus. A right- sided ventriculoatrial shunt was placed, resulting in temporary resolution of the patient s headaches. Post- operative CT images showed decompression of the right lateral ventricle but persistent enlargment of the left lateral ventricle. Six months after the initial shunt operation, headaches recurred. A left lateral ventricular catheter was placed and connected to the existing shunt system. One shunt revision was required in November 1985, after which both ventricles remained collapsed. Following the initial shunting procedure, the pa- tient s memory improved enough that she could care for herself and her 5-year-old daughter. Over the next 3 0090-3019/89/$3. 50 Hypothalamic Germinoma Figure 1.

She employed mnemonic strategies, such as writing fre- quent notes to herself. However, during this same period, she was able to learn the ceramics trade and help in her parents store. In June 1987, her memory began to deteriorate at an accelerated pace. As she could no longer keep track of her note papers, she wrote on the back of her hand. If left unsupervised, she could not remember what she was supposed to be doing or where she was. Other intellectual functions remained intact. She continued to read magazines and the daily news- paper but had to reread an article from the beginning if interrupted. During this same period, her appetite increased and she gained more than 25 kg of body weight. Computed tomography scans in June and Sep- tember 1987 (Figure 2) showed a contrast-enhancing lesion infiltrating the anterior hypothalamus and thala- Surg Neurol 229 1989; 31: 228~33 mus bilaterally, the septum pellucidum, and the left basal ganglia. When examined at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh in September 1987, the patient was obese and had well-healed shunt incisions. Her affect, atten- tion, intellectual functions, and findings of a general neurological examination were all normal, with the exception of memory. She was oriented to person and place but had to refer to her calendar watch to tell the day or date. She could recall immediately up to seven digits but could not remember any of three objects after 5 minutes. If distracted, she could not recall that she had been asked to remember anything. Clues were not helpful. She was aware of her deficits and did not confabulate. Her remote memory was normal for events Figure 2.

A contrast-enhancing lesion infiltrates the septum pellucidum, bilateral basal forebrain, anterior hypothalamus, thalamus, and post- eromedial portion of the head of the left caudate nucleus and anterior limb of the internal capsule. Both anterior fornices as well as the mammillothalamic tracts lie within the area of tumor enhancement. The lateral ventricles have been decompressed by ventriculoatrial shunts, 230 Surg Neurol 198933 1: 228-33 Figure 3. A midsagittal magnetic resonance image performed at 1. 5-tesla field strength (echo time 20 msec; repetition time 700 msec) in September 1987 shows decreased T1 signal in the septum and peri-third ventricular region corresponding to the contrast enhancement in Figure 2. The suprasellar space, optic chiasm, and pineal region are normal, Coffey prior to her first hospitalization. However, her own account of her medical history for the past 3 years was flawed by omissions and temporal errors. She manifested neither polydipsia nor polyuria. Lab- oratory examination, including serum electrolytes, cor- tisol, prolactin, and thyroid hormone levels, were nor- mal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 3) performed with a field strength of 1. 5 tesla confirmed the presence of an intraaxial septal and peri-third ven- tricular lesion without involvement of the suprasellar space or pineal region. The lesion showed low T1- weighted signal intensity and increased T2-weighted signal intensity consistent with neoplastic tissue. A CT- guided stereotactic biopsy of the left-sided lateral com- ponent of the lesion disclosed a germinoma of the two-cell type histological pattern (Figure 4) . Due to the extensive ependymal surface involvement with tumor and its disruption by the biopsy procedure, and because she had ventricular shunts, the patient was treated with craniospinal irradiation {2, 14, 21}: 50. 4 Gy Figure 4.

Computed tomography scans at the com- pletion of radiation therapy (4 months after biopsy) and 11 months after biopsy showed complete disappearance of the tumor (Figure 5) . The patient has developed no new neurological or endocrine deficits during the 11 months since diagnosis. Her memory has not improved. Comment Intracranial germ cell tumors, which include germi- noma, teratoma (mature and immature) , embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and endodermal sinus tu- mor, occur almost exclusively in the midline pineal or suprasellar regions [10, 11, 15]. All except the mature teratoma and some cases of immature teratoma are histologically malignant [10, 15, 19]}. Parinaud s syn- drome and hydrocephalus are the characteristic pre- Surg Neurol 231 1989; 31: 228-33 senting clinical features of pineal region lesions, whereas anterior hypopituitarism, visual field defects, and DI are associated with suprasellar (infundibular) germinomas. The few confirmed cases of intraparen- chymal germinoma involving the thalamus, hypothala- mus, or basal ganglia have been characterized by various combinations of progressive hemiparesis, hypopituita- rism, DI, anorexia, defective thermoregulation, visual failure, or diminished level of consciousness {7, 9, 12}. All previously reported patients have been male. Kobayashi et al [12] described the clinical character- istics of six patients with suspected germinomas of the basal ganglia and thalamus. All were 12 years old or younger when symptoms began. Histologic con- firmation was obtained in five cases. Grote et al [9] reported a case of simultaneous germinoma and spongi- oblastoma involving the hypothalamus, which was con- firmed at autopsy, in a 16-year-old boy. More recently, Epstein et al {7} described another case of hypothalamic germinoma diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy in a 14- year-old boy. Among those eight patients, six had progressive hemiparesis and severe mental status changes or an altered level of consciousness, four had DI and visual loss, and three had abnormal extraocular movements. Two patients each demonstrated either a combination of obesity and panhypopituitarism or pre- cocious puberty. The site of tumor origin was docu- mented by CT in only two of Kobayashi s patients, the remainder having been treated in the pre-CT era. One of the tumors documented by CT was irradiated without histologic confirmation. Thus, in only three of the eight recently reported cases were both reliable anatomic and histologic confirmation available. Dayan et al [5] reviewed 104 cases of germinoma (then called atypical teratoma ) reported in the medical literature between 1914 and 1964, and added ten new cases of their own. They found 27 patients with tumors involving the anterior hypothalamus and no identifiable pineal region abnormality. However, during the era spanned by the review, the available radiographic stud- ies could not reliably differentiate suprasellar from intrahypothalamic mass lesions. The optic chiasm or suprasellar region was involved clinically, radiograph- ically, at surgical exploration, or at autopsy in all cases. Most patients presented at such an advanced state of disease that even postmortem examination could not define the precise site of tumor origin. Resolution of a pineal region of suprasellar mass early in the course of therapeutic irradiation is charac- teristic, but not pathognomonic, of germinoma {2, 4, 14, 18, 21, 22, 24]. Because other entities (such as lymphoma or metastatic oat cell carcinoma) may show a similar early response to radiation therapy, interpreta- tion of presenting features or results of treatment is 232 Surg Neurol 1989; 31: 228-33 difficult in the many series in which the diagnosis of germinoma was based on clinical or radiographic criteria alone. The present case is unique in that the patient had none of the neuroophthalmologic or endocrine findings usually associated with intracranial germinomas. She remained relatively stable for 3 years after cerebrospinal fluid shunting to relieve ventricular obstruction at the level of the foramen of Monro. Later, a profound selective anterograde amnesia associated with hyper- phagia developed concurrent with the evolution of an infiltrating tumor involving the anterior medial portions of the thalamus and hypothalamus bilaterally. Alehough an association between disturbed memory function and third ventricular tumors or surgical intervention has been recognized for several decades, in most cases, the exact brain structures involved have not been deter- mined [8, 25]. The anatomic basis for this patient s amnestic syndrome was most likely bilateral involve- ment of the descending columns of the fornix and/or the mammillothalamic tracts as visualized on the pre- operative CT and MRI images [3, 8, 16, 20]. Patients who have an episode of acute hydrocephalus and trans- tentorial herniation that leads to compression of the posterior cerebral arteries at the incisura have de- veloped recent memory deficits as a result of bilateral mesial temporal lobe ischemia or infarction. Most have demonstrated visual field defects or cortical blindness from concomitant ischemia of the calcarine cortex. In the present case, progression of memory loss despite the relief of hydrocephalus and the absence of visual field abnormalities made a vascular cause unlikely. Although this patient s memory disorder resembled that seen in Korsakoff's syndrome, the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei did not appear to be involved. Her lack of clinical recovery despite radiographic disappearnce of the tu- mor implied permanent tissue damage by the infiltrating neoplasm rather than neural compression. Hyperphagia and obesity have been associated with tumors and other naturally occurring or experimentally produced lesions involving the ventromedial hypothala- mus in humans and laboratory animals [13]. Whether these phenomena represent a primary behavioral effect or a primary alteration in energy homeostasis remains controversial. In some cases of hypothalamic germi- noma, extensive involvement of both the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus has produced a clinical syndrome of life-threatening anorexia and cachexia {5, 9}. Although our patient lost weight during radiation therapy, she rapidly attained her preoperative weight by the conclusion of therapy, again suggesting permanent damage to the medial hypothalamus. The discovery of a malignant yet highly radiosen- sitive tumor in the present case supports the use of Coffey imaging methods, including CT and MRI, in patients suspected of harboring intrahypothalamic mass lesions. Stereotactic biopsy provided a sample of tumor tissue without inflicting additional neurologic deficits, thus, allowing rational treatment based on an accurate histo- logic diagnosis.

Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Canada Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Israel Received 20 December 2005; received in revised form 11 May 2006; accepted 16 May 2006 Abstract AD, a 45-year-old man, presented with a severe and global anterograde amnesia following surgery for removal of a colloid cyst. Structural neu- roimaging confirmed bilateral lesions to the fornix and a small lesion in the basal forebrain. Testing for remote episodic memory of autobiographical events, and for remote semantic memory of personal and public events, and of famous people, revealed that AD had a severe retrograde amnesia for autobiographical episodes that covered his entire lifetime, and a time-limited retrograde amnesia for semantic memory. Because the fornix and basal forebrain lesions disrupted major afferent and efferent pathways of the hippocampus, it was concluded that the integrity of the hippocampus and its projections are needed to retain and/or recover autobiographical memories no matter how old they are. By there is an emerging consensus that memory for specific personal information (episodic memory) is severely affected, with memory for general knowledge and factual infor- mation about the world and oneself (semantic memory) being relatively spared (for review see Moscovitch, Rosenbaum et al. , 2005) . This evidence is consistent with Multiple Trace Theory which posits that the hippocampus and related MTL structures are always needed for retention and recovery of contextually rich information, which is the hallmark of episodic memory. On the other hand, memories that are independent of the context in which they were acquired, such as semantic memories, can be mediated through extra-hippocampal structures (Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997; Rosenbaum, Winocur, & Moscovitch, 2001) . 2242 A. Poreh et al. / Neuropsychologia 44 (2006) 2241-2248 It has been difficult to evaluate the contribution of the hip- pocampus to remote memory because rarely, if ever, is damage restricted to this structure in humans. Furthermore, when it is, the hippocampal lesion is smaller than in patients whose lesions extend beyond this structure. In other words, we do not have a case where most of the hippocampus is destroyed without also encroaching on extra-hippocampal structures. We address these issues in a patient, AD, with bilateral lesions to the fornix, a major pathway linking the hippocampus to basal forebrain and diencephalic regions implicated in memory. The fornix is the primary efferent projection from the hippocampus to the mamillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei, and also contains afferent cholinergic tracts from the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain to the hippocampus. To a lesser extent, other basal forebrain pathways project via the fornix to entorhinal cortex. Basal forebrain projections via the temporal stem, amygdale, and entorhinal cortex to hippocampus are relatively unaffected by fornix transaction (Gaffan, Parker, & Easton, 2001; Mesulam, Mufson, Levey, & Wainer, 1983; Ridley, Baker, Harder, & Pearson, 1996; Selden, Gitelman, Salamon-Murayama, Parrish, & Mesulam, 1998) . Thus, AD s lesion interrupts major hip- pocampal output and the primary cholinergic input into the hippocampus, without affecting the structural integrity of the hippocampus and other MTL structures themselves. Although there are some efferent projections from the hippocampus to adjacent MTL structures via other pathways, AD s fornix lesion allows us to examine memory function while selectively remov- ing a major contribution of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Bilateral damage to the fornix is known to impair antero- grade memory, although there is considerable variability in the degree of memory loss that is reported (see reviews by Aggleton et al. , 2000; Spiers, Maguire, & Burgess, 2001) . Although some authors report that ablation of the anterior column of the fornix does not induce memory dysfunction (Bauer, Tobias, & Valenstein, 1993) , others suggest that in certain cases, particu- larly after the removal of a colloid cyst, anterior fornicotomy may cause severe anterograde amnesia (Aggleton et al. , 2000; Carmel, 1985; Easton, Ridley, Baker, & Gaffan, 2002; Gaffan, 1994; Gaffan, Gaffan, and Hodges, 1991; Garcia-Bengochea & Friedman, 1987; McMackin, Cockburn, Anslow, & Gaffan, 1995; Sweet, Talland, & Ervin, 1959) , as it did in our patient. There are several reasons for such variability including, once again, the size and location of the lesion, type of memory tested, and whether the lesion is unilateral or bilateral (for review see Gaffan & Gaffan, 1991) . There are far fewer studies on remote memory, but the available evidence suggests some loss, although the type and extent of remote memory loss is not well documented (D Esposito, Verfaellie, Alexander, & Katz, 1995; Hodges & Carpenter, 1991; Park, Hahn, Kim, Na, & Huh, 2000; Spiers et al. , 2001) . Based on the purported effects of fornix lesions on anterograde memory, we predicted that remote episodic memory would be severely impaired. We also predicted that remote semantic would be relatively spared as has been reported in patients with fornix lesions (Spiers et al. , 2001) , and in patients with MTL/hippocampal lesions (for reviews see Moscovitch, Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Moscovitch, Westmacott et al. , 2005; Moscovitch, Nadel, Winocur, Gilboa, & Rosenbaum, 2006) . 2. Case report AD, a right-handed 45-year-old male, was referred to the Neurosurgery Department of a large Israeli medical center with a 1-month history of excruciating headaches. An MRI T1 study revealed a typical high-density non-enhancing colloid-cyst situ- ated in the anterior part of the third ventricle, with a mild degree of obstructive hydrocephalus (see Fig. 1) . The patient had no complaints of memory loss, and continued working up to the time of the surgery. Physical examination revealed no abnor- malities. Surgery was performed | month following his initial refer- ral. A right frontal transcortical approach to the left Foramen of Monro, allowed the neurosurgeon access to the cyst. A typ- ical dense colloid cyst was identified embedded in the anterior portion of the third ventricle, attached to its base. The cyst was removed via the Foramen of Monro with no unusual operative complications. AD s recovery in the immediate post-operative period was normal but soon after, he began to suffer from dia- betes insipidus and became extremely confused. Within 48 h of surgery, AD was interviewed by the first and second authors. He was unsure why he was hospitalized, could not recognize his neurosurgeon, and was unable to retain simple verbal material (such as three words) for more than a few min- utes. AD s remote memory was also impaired. He was unable to recall any autobiographical events that occurred in the past 20 years. Although he recognized his wife and children, AD was unable to draw the exterior part of his house even though he had helped design it. His drawing of it was limited to a three-dimensional cube. After a 20-min bedside evaluation, the interviewers stepped out of the room. Upon their return, AD noted that he knew them, as he had met them a few years ago . Two weeks following the operation, AD was re-evaluated and, although there was some general improvement, it was clear that he was severely amnesic. 2. 1. Structural neuroimaging and lesion location MRI brain scans were conducted 2 months post-surgery using an Elcint Prestige T2 machine with 5mm thick scans. These scans showed no damage to the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. An additional MRI was per- formed on the same machine, with 3 mm thick scans (TE 30/80, TR3000, 22 cm POV) . An initial inspection of the resultant MRI scans documented a complete transection of the left anterior column of the fornix at the level of the anterior commissure, damage to the left anterior commissure, and a tiny infarct to the caudate nucleus on the right (Fig. 1) . Later consultations with Dr. Fuqiang Gao from Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto and Dr. Michael Alexander of Harvard Medical School confirmed these observations. Additional damage to the right anterior col- umn of the fornix was identified which, given the limitations of the scans, was estimated to affect 75% of the tract, just ante- rior to the third ventricle above the anterior commissure.

SPECT brain scans using an Elcint XZ122 were also obtained. These scans were interpreted as showing a significant bilateral hypoperfusion of the mesial temporal regions. 2. 2. Neuropsychological evaluation and anterograde memory A month after the initial evaluation, AD became anxious and agitated about his condition. His wife noted that he often cried and wanted her to stay by his side. She also noted that each time he woke up, he reported that he was in a dream-like state. His MMPI-2 profile was elevated, with his scores on the Anxiety and Depression scales being T=66 and 67, respectively. A formal neuropsychological evaluation was then conducted on an out- patient basis. Neuropsychological test results are summarized in Table 1. The patient s intellectual performance, as measured by the WAIS-R, was in the higher end of the average range (IQ = 109) . AD s verbal abilities, as measured by the Boston naming test (BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 1978) , the controlled word association test (FAS) and semantic fluency (Benton, Hamsher, & Sivan 1983) , were in the normal range. On the Wisconsin card sorting test, another measure of executive func- tioning, AD performed within the normal range for his age, achieving five categories (WCST, Berg, 1948; Heaton, 1981) but he tested in the borderline range for number of perseverative errors. Informal testing did not reveal any dyslexic or dysgraphic errors. He had no difficulty in performing complex arithmetic tasks. Working memory, as measured by both digit and spatial span, was normal, as were visual constructional abilities, as mea- sured by the Rey Osterrieth copy figure test (ROCF, Osterrieth, 1944) . In contrast to his relatively intact intellectual functioning, AD exhibited severe verbal and visual memory deficits. He showed no improvement with repeated presentation on the auditory ver- bal learning test (AVLT; Rey, 1958) and following interference, recalled only 1/6 of the words he had previously recalled. After a 30min delay, he had no recollection of the task. On long- term recognition, his responses were at chance. On the Wechsler memory scale revised (WMS-R, Wechsler, 1981) story recall subtest, he scored in the impaired range even on immediate recall. After a 30 min delay, he was unable to recall having heard the story. When he was asked to recall the ROCF after a 3-min delay, AD s score was 0. A follow-up neuropsychological evaluation was carried out 9 months post-surgery. During this testing, AD was also re-administered the MMPI-2 test. His profile indicated a heightened anxiety level and moderate depression. The results of the neuropsychological assessment are presented in Table 1. A. Poreh et al. / Neuropsychologia 44 (2006) 2241-2248 2245 100 Percent Correct Childhood Early Adulthood Adulthood @ Semantic 3 months post surgery Episodic 3 months post surgery - - Semantic 9 months post surgery O - Episodic 9 months post surgery Fig. 2. Autobiographical memory interview (AMI) percent scores at childhood, early adulthood and adulthood. Percentages were calculated based on a maxi- mum score of 21 for semantic memory, and 9, for episodic memory. It can be seen that AD s anterograde amnesia persisted. His performance in other cognitive domains, including language, executive and working memory, also remained essentially unchanged. 2. 3. Remote memory AD s remote memory for public and autobiographical events was assessed to determine the nature and extent of his retrograde amnesia. Memory for faces and public events was assessed using the famous Israeli faces and famous Israeli public events tests developed by the first author. Items were drawn from commonly available books, scanned into PowerPoint presentation using a color scanner, and presented using a portable computer. When- ever AD could not answer a question, the examiner provided him with several multiple choice options. Autobiographical memory was assessed by the Autobi- ographical Memory Interview (AMI, Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1989) and a set of 16 family photographs that were provided by AD s daughter. All the stimuli were presented using a portable computer. The AMI consists of two sub-scales, Per- sonal Semantic and Autobiographical Incidents, that sample memories from three time periods: childhood (ages 0-18) , early adulthood (ages 18-30) , and recent (within the past 5 years) . The personal semantic sub-scale probes memory for general personal information such as names of friends and teachers, locations of schools attended, etc. The maximum score for each time period is 21 points. The Autobiographical Incidents sub-scale includes questions about specific events that require temporal and spatial contextual information for each incident. Three such incidents, such as first day at work , are sampled at each time period with each incident receiving a maximum of 3 points, depending on the descriptive richness of the response and its specificity as to time and place.

Percentage correct for personal events (max=16) , famous faces (max = 19) , and famous events (max = 20) . Fig. 2 depicts the results of the AMI. AD exhibited a general impairment in remote memory that was more severe for autobio- graphical incidents than for personal semantics. On the personal semantic sub-scale, AD showed a gradient in retrograde memory loss, in that the childhood score was within the normal range, whereas his early adulthood score indicated significant loss at 3 months which had recovered by 9 months. Scores for the recent time-period reflected an extensive anterograde memory deficit for personal semantics. Consequently, it is likely that memory for the most recent events draws on episodic memory as well as semantic knowledge. By contrast, memory for autobiograph- ical episodes was severely impaired for the recent, and early adulthood periods, with borderline impairment of childhood memories. Interestingly, his childhood scores were elevated by two highly significant and emotional events that he recounts often and may constitute personal folklore (Cermak, 1984; Cermak & O Connor, 1983) rather than true episodic memory. On tests of famous faces and public events, AD was asked to name the person in the picture or identify the event during which the picture was taken. Whenever AD could not answer the ques- tion, he was prompted by a series of multiple choice options. For faces, there were 6, 6, and 7 faces from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively. For events, the corresponding numbers were 7, 6 and 7. He scored within the normal range for all time periods dating from the 1970s to the present. Performance on these tests was compared to that on a test of autobiographical memory in which he had to describe episodes depicted in 16 family photographs, 4, 6 and 6, for each decade. For each pho- tograph, he was asked to provide details as to when the event occurred and who participated in the event. As seen in Fig. 3, he performed poorly on these tests relative to his performance on the famous faces and public events tests. We note, however, that he provided general semantic information related to the pictures (see below) without remembering the episodes to which they referred. His wife performed well on all of the measures and correctly identified more than 90% of the pictures. Below is a summary of some of his responses: 2246 A.

Discussion This study shows that bilateral lesions of the fornix lead to anterograde and retrograde amnesia without significantly affect- ing most other cognitive functions. The anterograde amnesia encompassed both verbal and non-verbal long-term memory in tests of recall and recognition, but short-term memory was spared. AD s retrograde amnesia was more severe for autobio- graphical episodes than for personal semantics, thereby confirm- ing the selective contribution of the hippocampal system and pro- jections to basal forebrain to recovering remote episodic mem- ory. There was a temporal gradient for personal semantics, with memories from early adult life and childhood being relatively spared. In contrast, memory for autobiographical episodes, even those from early childhood, was impaired. The latter results pro- vide important new evidence for the dissociation between remote episodic and semantic memory with respect to hippocampal sys- tem function. The impaired anterograde memory loss in AD resembles that observed following bilateral damage to the MTL, which includes the hippocampus (Eichenbaum & Cohen, 2001; Squire, Stark, & Clark, 2004) and its projections to basal forebrain (Gaffan et al. , 2001) . In most cases such damage is quite extensive and rarely restricted to the hippocampal formation. In our case, we demonstrated the typical features of MTL anterograde amnesia in a patient with lesions that were circumscribed to the fornical columns, and a small region of the basal forebrain, but left the rest of the MTL system, including the hippocampus, structurally intact. Our findings are generally consistent with reports of antero- grade memory loss following lesions of the anterior fornix, including those resulting from colloid cyst removal (Bauer et al. , 1993; Calabrese, Markowitsch, Harders, Scholz, & Gehlen, 1995; Carmel, 1985; Gaffan & Gaffan, 1991; Gaffan et al. , 1991; Garcia-Bengochea & Friedman, 1987; Spiers et al. , 2001; Sweet etal. , 1959; Tucker, Roeltgen, Tully, Hartmann & Boxell, 1988) . AD showed poor recall and poor recognition on the RAVLT, pri- marily because of an elevated false alarm rate. The impaired recognition differs from Aggleton et al s (2000) report that patients with bilateral lesions to the fornix were only impaired on recall. Studies of animals with surgical lesions to the fornix have revealed the same pattern of preserved item recognition (e. g. Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Gaffan, Shields, & Harrison, 1984; Zola-Morgan, 1989) but impaired recognition of the same items when they were embedded in unique contexts (Gaffan, 1994) . The deficit was increased when the basal forebrain was impli- cated (Gaffan et al. , 2001) . The reason for the discrepancy in AD s results is not clear but it may be that AD tried to rely on general contextual cues rather than familiarity to support recog- nition. By extension, the same arguments can be made with respect to retrograde amnesia following MTL damage. Two general pat- terns of retrograde amnesia have been reported in such patients. In one, there is a temporal gradient with recent memories being more severely affected, and very remote memories being spared, regardless of whether the memory is semantic or episodic. In the other, there is temporally extensive and severe retrograde amnesia, often dating back to early childhood, for episodic mem- ory but a milder and temporally graded retrograde amnesia for semantic memory which is based more on familiarity (Fujii, Moscovitch, & Nadel, 2000; Moscovitch, Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Moscovitch, Westmacott et al. , 2005; Moscovitch et al. , 2006) . AD s retrograde amnesia conforms more closely to the second of the two patterns. On the AMI, AD showed a temporally graded retrograde amnesia for personal semantics with early childhood memo- ries being spared, and a more severe and temporally extensive deficit for autobiographical episodes. He had no autobiographi- cal memories dating as far back as early adulthood, and had only a few, impoverished memories for early childhood. As we noted, for the latter period, his scores were elevated by two highly sig- nificant and emotional events that had been well-rehearsed and effectively had come to exist as semantic memories (Cermak, 1984; Cermak & O Connor, 1983) . The results from the famous faces, famous public events, and family photos tests support this interpretation. Unlike the AMI, in which personal semantics may be contaminated by autobio- graphical episodes, the first two of the above tests are less prone to that confound. We found that, on the public events and faces test, AD scored normally at all the remote time periods, even the most recent ones, further indicating that remote semantic mem- ory is not dependent on the hippocampal system. These findings also suggest that the temporal gradient for semantic memory observed in other patients with MTL damage may arise either from damage to extra-hippocampal structures, or from contam- ination by attempts to use episodic information related to the more recent events. By contrast, on the family photos test, AD had a retrograde amnesia that extended to early childhood with no temporal gra- dient. The absence of a gradient on this test is especially informa- tive because the nature of the test diminishes the possibility that well-rehearsed memories would be produced. Unlike the AMI, the memories elicited by the photos were not self-selected. As A. Poreh et al. / Neuropsychologia 44 (2006) 2241-2248 2247 such, they had to be based on reinstatement of autobiographical experiences in their spatial and temporal contexts rather than on family folklore (Cermak, 1984; Cermak & O Connor, 1983) . Bayley et al. (2005) proposed that temporally extensive ret- rograde amnesia in MTL patients occurs only when the damage extends to lateral neocortex. Our results do not support this interpretation. Despite having no neocortical damage and small lesions to the fornix and basal forebrain area, AD s retrograde amnesia for autobiographical episodes is temporally extensive and severe. It follows that the MTL, and the hippocampus in particular, are crucial for recovering autobiographical episodes, no matter how remote, and may also contribute temporarily to recovery of semantic memory. While there have been reports of patients with spared autobiographical memories following lesions restricted to MTL (Bayley et al. , 2005) , other investiga- tors have found the amnesia to be far more extensive (Cipolotti et al. , 2001; Moscovitch et al. , 2006) . The reason for these dis- crepancies has yet to be determined. In addition to his fornix lesions, AD also has a small basal forebrain lesion. It is unlikely that this lesion alone caused his severe amnesia for the following reasons: (1) unilateral discrete lesions to the basal forebrain tend to produce modality spe- cific (i. e. visual or verbal) deficits (Abe, Inokawa, Kashiwagi, & Yanagihara, 1998; Goldenberg, Schuri, Gromminger, & Arnold, 1999; Morris, Bowers, Chatterjee, & Heilman, 1992) , whereas AD had both visual and verbal anterograde memory deficits. (2) Retrograde memory loss is minimal or non-existent following discrete basal forebrain lesions (Abe et al. , 1998; Goldenberg et al. , 1999; Hashimoto, Tanaka, & Nakano, 2000; Morris et al. , 1992) . (3) Finally, the precommissural columns of the fornix are the primary cholinergic routes from the basal forebrain to the hippocampus, with less extensive projections to neighbor- ing MTL cortices (Easton et al. , 2002; Morris et al. , 1992) . Given AD s bilateral fornix lesions, no additional effect of basal forebrain lesions on hippocampal function is likely. The results of the SPECT scan, which show hypo-perfusion only in the MTL, are broadly consistent with this interpretation. However, it should be noted, that the basal forebrain lesion may exac- erbate the effects of the fornix lesion (Gaffan et al. , 2001) . In this case, the only contribution that the basal forebrain lesion may have made to AD s performance is an increased suscep- tibility to false alarms in recognition, and intrusions in recall (Abe et al. , 1998; Goldenberg et al. , 1999; Hashimoto et al. , 2000; Morris et al. , 1992) . The important point to emphasize here is that only remote memory for autobiographical episodes was severely affected, whereas semantic memory was relatively spared. Although MTL extra-hippocampal structures such as the perirhinal cortex also receive cholinergic input from the basal forebrain, these are restricted to allocortical rather than neocor- tical regions, and they receive additional cholinergic input from lateral basal forebrain structures which were intact in AD. The relatively spared semantic memory believed to be mediated by them suggests that their function is sufficiently preserved.

Introduction Itis widely accepted that bilateral damage to the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, the perirhi- nal, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, leads to severe anterograde amnesia. However, there is considerable debate regarding the effects of damage to this region on remote memory. The debate turns on several points: (1) the location and extent of the lesion; (2) the temporal extent and severity of the deficit, and (3) the type of memory which is affected. With respect to the first two points, studies show that damage restricted to the MTL, which includes the hippocampus, leads to remote memory loss, the severity and extent being determined by the location and size of the lesion (Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Others argue that the * Corresponding author. 0028-3932/$ see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

With respect to the type of memory deficit in patients with damage limited to the MTL, the MTL, with the hippocam- pus being crucial for re-experiencing episodic events (recol- lection) and extra-hippocampal structures, such as the entorhi- nal and perirhinal cortex, for familiarity (Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Eichenbaum, 2001) . Our finding that autobiographical memories, which rely on recollection, are impaired, whereas familiarity-based semantic memories are spared, indicate that this view applies as much to remote memory as to anterograde memory. These findings, together with converging evidence from other studies on humans (e. g. see Gilboa, Winocur, Grady, Hevenor, & Moscovitch, 2004; Moscovitch, Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Moscovitch, Westmacott et al. , 2005; Moscovitch et al. , 2006) and animals (Frankland & Bontempi, 2005; Rosenbaum et al. , 2001; Winocur, Moscovitch, Fogel, Rosenbaum, & Sekeres, 2005) , provide the basis for an emerging view, consistent with Multiple Trace Theory, that re-experiencing contextually rich memories are dependent on the hippocampal system no matter how old they are, whereas recovery of semantic memory can be accomplished independently of it (see Moscovitch, Rosenbaum et al. , 2005; Moscovitch, Westmacott et al. , 2005; Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997; Rosenbaum et al. , 2001) .

We report the case of a 77-year-old woman presenting with com- plete anterograde and significant retrograde amne- sia developing during an influenza B infection. Cra- nial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hip- pocampal lesions including restricted diffusion during the acute phase. Symptoms partially improved follow- ing treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins but an amnesic syndrome per- sisted. We discuss possible causes of neurological complications in influenza infections. Keywords Influenza virus - Viral encephalitis - Cytokine storm - Neurotropism - Antineuronal antibodies Introduction Influenza is a febrile illness caused by a group of lipid- enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyx- oviridae family. Large droplet transmission is held to be the main pathway of infection but a contribution of airborne transmission cannot be excluded [1]. On infection the virus replicates and is secreted by res- piratory epithelial cells. This is accompanied by an influx of neutrophils, desquamation of apoptotic cells into the airways and a secondary cytokine response leading to local and systemic inflammation [2]. Most influenza infections are self-limiting, presenting with K. Koll, MD - K. Urlesberger - W.

Willinger, MD Department of Radiology, Klinik Ottakring Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria general malaise and respiratory symptoms. Neuro- logical complications are regarded as rare. Histori- cally, encephalitis lethargica, postencephalitic parkin- sonism and Reye s syndrome have been associated with influenza outbreaks but the pathogenic role of the influenza infection in these conditions has not been firmly established. Influenza-associated acute encephalopathy (IAE) , defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC) as altered mental status of >24h dura- tion developing within the first days of an influenza infection [2] is nowadays the most common neurolog- ical complication. Children below the age of 5 years are at highest risk but other age groups may be af- fected as well. The IAE is a rapid progressive en- cephalopathy which may be associated with seizures and/or loss of consciousness and can result in severe permanent neurological sequelae and death [3, 4]. The IAE with amnesia as the cardinal symptom has been described only rarely [5, 6]. We report a case of an acute and persisting amnestic syndrome asso- ciated with hippocampal lesions following an acute influenza B infection. Patient report During the 2017/2018 influenza season a 77-year-old woman developed a respiratory infection and pre- sented to the emergency department with pyrexia, chest pain and nausea. According to a third party medical history the patient already showed signs of confusion on the second day after symptom onset. A rapid swab was positive for influenza B. After an acute coronary syndrome was excluded as the cause of chest pains, the patient was discharged home with an oral course of oseltamivir. A few days later the patient was readmitted to hospital for worsening of confusion. Initial work-up showed mildly elevated 542 Acute amnestic syndrome with hippocampal lesion due to influenza B-associated encephalopathy D Springer Fig. 1 a Axial fluid-at- tenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity of the left hippocampus in the acute phase. b Re- stricted diffusion of the left hippocampus in the acute phase (diffusion-weighted imaging, DWI axial) .

Upper respiratory tract swab RNA PCR was positive for influenza B and negative for influenza A. The background medical history included sphenoid ridge meningioma surgery on the right side 20 years before, with subsequent right-sided visual and oculo- motor nerve dysfunction. Further comorbidities were arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia and type 2 dia- betes mellitus. The neurological examination revealed a _ pro- nounced cognitive deficit with complete retrograde amnesia for the past 15 years as well as severe antero- grade amnesia. The pre-existing visual and oculomo- tor dysfunction of the right eye was unchanged. A 3- Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 1 week after symptom onset showed moderately restricted diffusion and fluid-attenuated inversion re- covery (FLAIR) hyperintensity affecting the entire left hippocampus (Fig. la, b; Fig. 2) . Additionally, a resid- ual right sphenoid ridge meningioma was visible. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was unremark- able, including negative PCR for influenza virus in CSE Antineuronal antibodies were not detected in CSF and serum. There was no evidence for epileptic seizures on clinical assessment or electroencephalog- raphy (EEG) . Based on the patient s clinical course, positive influenza B testing and negative work-up for other forms of encephalitis, she was diagnosed with JAE. A 5-day course of intravenous high-dose (1000 mg) methylprednisolone led to a slight clinical improve- ment. A standard course of intravenous immunoglob- ulins (2 g/kg over 5 days) brought no further improve- ment of the severe amnestic syndrome. The MRI fol- low-up examinations after 1 and 3 months showed complete resolution of diffusion restriction and a par- tial regression of the FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity of the left hippocampus (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2b) . Clinical follow-up after 6 and 22 months found the patient in good general health with improved global cognitive function and moderately improved retrograde amnesia. Memory testing showed no im- provement of the profound anterograde amnesia. Serum antineuronal antibodies remained negative at the 6-month follow-up.

Brain MRI during the acute phase of the illness showed a left hippocam- D Springer Acute amnestic syndrome with hippocampal lesion due to influenza B-associated encephalopathy 543 short report pal lesion with moderately restricted diffusion. The CSF analysis revealed no signs of infectious encephali- tis and serum and CSF antineuronal antibodies were negative. Symptoms improved after a course of intra- venous methylprednisolone, but anterograde amne- sia persisted. Based on the clinical course and work- up, the patient most likely represents a rare case of influenza B-associated encephalopathy with predom- inant amnesia. The pre-existing right hippocampal lesion may have contributed to the persistence of the symptoms. A similar syndrome with global but reversible am- nesia and transient MRI lesions in both hippocampi has been observed in a 24-year-old man following influenza A [5]. Amnesia was also the predominant symptom during the early phase of an influenza A- associated encephalopathy that rapidly progressed to coma in a 57-year-old woman. Brain MRI showed symmetric hemorrhagic changes in both mesial tem- poral lobes and thalami, indicating acute necrotizing encephalopathy, the most severe form of IAE [6]. Encephalopathy and seizures are the most com- mon neurological complications of influenza infec- tions. The IAE occurs most frequently in children, but the number of reported adult cases is increasing. Most adult IAE cases are associated with influenza A virus strains, but there are some reports of influenza B virus-associated encephalopathy [7, 8]. The exact pathomechanism of IAE in humans re- mains unclear. Affected patients showed increased serum, plasma or CSF levels of cytokines, chemokines and associated mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [9, 10]. The serum cytokine levels peak on the second day after symptom onset, correlating with peak viral repli- cation [2]. Due to lack of evidence of a direct inva- sion of the brain by most influenza strains, a cytokine storm-derived cerebral edema is postulated as a pos- sible pathomechanism [3]. A similar mechanism lead- ing to encephalopathy has been discussed in children during primary infection with human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) and respiratory syncytial virus infection. In- terestingly, chronic inflammatory changes in the hip- pocampus have been recently observed in experimen- tal mice following infection with non-neurotropic in- fluenza A strains, although more severe changes were found in the same experiment with a neurotropic in- fluenza A strain [11]. Autoimmune encephalitis triggered by the viral in- fection similar to post-herpes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis may be another expla- nation; however, the acute clinical onset during the very early phase of influenza, the lack of inflamma- tory CSF changes and the negative results of neuronal autoantibody testing during the acute phase and on follow-up strongly argue against this possibility in our case. Further clinical, microbiological, and pathological data are necessary in order better understand of the exact pathomechanism of IAE. It could lead to quicker diagnosis, better treatment, and possibly prevent neu- rological sequelae. Compliance with ethical guidelines Conflict of interest K. Koll, S. Willinger, K.
