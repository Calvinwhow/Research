We are embarking on the development of a Python-based software infrastructure for large-scale neuroimaging analyses. Our goal is to perform a variety of analyses, including neural networks, random forests, regressions, and mediation analyses on our neuroimaging data. Before we can implement these models, we first need to create an efficient and reliable system for handling and preprocessing our data.

Our neuroimaging data is stored in 4D Nifti files, where each index of the fourth dimension corresponds to a patient. We will provide you with a design matrix CSV file that maps the independent variables to the corresponding 4D Nifti files. An additional file will contain the dependent variable data, which is a matrix with dimensions (n_patients, 1) where each index corresponds to the respective patient in the fourth dimension of the Nifti files.

Your task is to develop a software system that processes these Nifti files and prepares the data for subsequent analysis. The system should:

Load the 4D Nifti files and the dependent variable data as specified in the design matrix.
Preprocess the data for each voxel and patient, while maintaining the association between patients and the fourth dimension of the Nifti files. The preprocessing steps should include any necessary transformations, normalization, and masking.
Organize the preprocessed data in a way that preserves the original structure and prepares it for the next stage of analysis.
The main challenges in this project are the large scale of the data, the need for efficient computation, and the requirement to preserve the integrity of the data structure. To address these challenges, your software should incorporate several strategies:

Parallel Processing: Leverage multiprocessing to perform preprocessing on multiple voxels simultaneously.
Efficient Disk I/O: Minimize the number of disk operations by processing a large chunk of voxels at once.
Memory Mapping: Use memory-mapped I/O for handling Nifti files, which reduces memory usage and potentially improves speed.
Error Handling: Catch any errors during preprocessing, print a message to the console with the voxel's coordinates and the nature of the error, and set the corresponding value to NaN.
Models: this to accept some sort of 'model' function that fits a given model to the voxel in question. Then, we can define any model that needs to be applied and we will be able to do so by simply adding models to a module. 

In addition, it's crucial that the software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently. Please develop unit tests for each part of the software, verifying that each function behaves as expected and handles errors appropriately.

We have prepared a rough pseudocode outline to guide your development:

import multiprocessing
import nibabel as nib
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def load_design_matrix(design_matrix_path):
    """
    Load the design matrix from a CSV file.
    """
    # Implement loading function here

def load_nifti_file(file_path):
    """
    Load a Nifti file with memory mapping enabled.
    """
    # Implement loading function here

def create_mask(mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2):
    """
    Create a mask with the given threshold.
    """
    # Implement mask creation function here

def mask_matrix(df_1, mask, mask_by='rows'):
    """
    Apply a mask to a DataFrame, keeping only the rows or columns that correspond to the mask.
    """
    # Implement mask_matrix function here

def standardize_data(data, standardize=True):
    """
    Standardize data (zero mean and unit variance).
    """
    if standardize:
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
    return data

def process_voxel(voxel_index, nifti_files, output_path, model_func, standardize=True):
    """
    Process a single voxel: extract data, mask and standardize it, apply model function, and save results.
    """
    voxel_data = [extract_voxel_data(img, voxel_index) for img in nifti_files]
    voxel_data = mask_matrix(voxel_data, mask)
    voxel_data = standardize_data(voxel_data, standardize)
    results = model_func(voxel_data)
    save_results_to_nifti(results, output_path)

def main(design_matrix_path, model_func, mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2, standardize=True):
    # Load design matrix
    design_matrix = load_design_matrix(design_matrix_path)

    # Load Nifti files with memory mapping
    nifti_files = [load_nifti_file(file_path) for file_path in design_matrix.values.flatten()]

    # Create mask
    mask = create_mask(mask_path, mask_threshold)

    # Use multiprocessing Pool to process voxels in parallel
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        for voxel_index in mask:
            pool.apply_async(process_voxel, args=(voxel_index, nifti_files, output_path, model_func, standardize))


Please note that this task focuses solely on the data handling and preprocessing steps. The development and implementation of the various models will be tackled in the next phase of the project. However, as you develop the software, it's important to keep the ultimate goal in mind. We are aiming to create a robust and efficient system that can serve as a solid foundation for our large-scale neuroimaging analyses.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project.
