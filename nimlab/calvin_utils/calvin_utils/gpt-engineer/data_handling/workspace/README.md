Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `FileWriter` class: Responsible for writing the "hello world" text to a file.

- `write_to_file(filename: str, text: str, append: bool) -> None`: Writes the given text to the specified file. If `append` is `True`, the text will be appended to the file if it exists, otherwise a new file will be created.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files.

**file_writer.py**
