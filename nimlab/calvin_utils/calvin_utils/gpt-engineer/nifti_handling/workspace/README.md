The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our system are:

1. `load_nifti_file(file_path)`: A function to load a Nifti file with memory mapping.
2. `create_mask(mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2)`: A function to create a mask with the given threshold.
3. `standardize_data(data, standardize=True)`: A function to standardize data (zero mean and unit variance).
4. `process_voxel(voxel_index, nifti_files, model_func, standardize=True)`: A function to extract data, mask and standardize it, and apply the model function.
5. `main(design_matrix_path, model_func, mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2, standardize=True)`: The main function that loads the design matrix, Nifti files, creates a mask, and processes voxels in parallel.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**1. `utils.py`**

This file will contain utility functions that are used across the system.
