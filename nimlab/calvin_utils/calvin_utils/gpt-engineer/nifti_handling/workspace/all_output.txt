The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our system are:

1. `load_nifti_file(file_path)`: A function to load a Nifti file with memory mapping.
2. `create_mask(mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2)`: A function to create a mask with the given threshold.
3. `standardize_data(data, standardize=True)`: A function to standardize data (zero mean and unit variance).
4. `process_voxel(voxel_index, nifti_files, model_func, standardize=True)`: A function to extract data, mask and standardize it, and apply the model function.
5. `main(design_matrix_path, model_func, mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2, standardize=True)`: The main function that loads the design matrix, Nifti files, creates a mask, and processes voxels in parallel.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**1. `utils.py`**

This file will contain utility functions that are used across the system.

```python
# utils.py

import numpy as np
import nibabel as nib

def load_nifti_file(file_path):
    """
    Load a Nifti file with memory mapping.
    """
    return nib.load(file_path, mmap=True)

def create_mask(mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2):
    """
    Create a mask with the given threshold.
    """
    # Implement mask creation logic here
    pass

def standardize_data(data, standardize=True):
    """
    Standardize data (zero mean and unit variance).
    """
    if standardize:
        # Implement data standardization logic here
        pass
    return data
```

**2. `preprocessing.py`**

This file will contain the preprocessing functions.

```python
# preprocessing.py

from utils import load_nifti_file, create_mask, standardize_data

def process_voxel(voxel_index, nifti_files, model_func, standardize=True):
    """
    Extract data, mask and standardize it, apply model function.
    """
    # Implement voxel processing logic here
    pass
```

**3. `main.py`**

This file will be the entry point of our system and will contain the `main` function.

```python
# main.py

from preprocessing import process_voxel
import pandas as pd

def main(design_matrix_path, model_func, mask_path=None, mask_threshold=0.2, standardize=True):
    """
    Load design matrix, Nifti files, create mask, process voxels in parallel.
    """
    # Load design matrix
    design_matrix = pd.read_csv(design_matrix_path)

    # Extract Nifti file paths from design matrix
    nifti_files = design_matrix.iloc[0].values

    # Create mask
    mask = create_mask(mask_path, mask_threshold)

    # Process voxels in parallel
    results = []
    for voxel_index in range(len(mask)):
        result = process_voxel(voxel_index, nifti_files, model_func, standardize)
        results.append(result)

    return results
```

**4. `models.py`**

This file will contain the model functions that will be used in the `process_voxel` function.

```python
# models.py

def model_func(data):
    """
    Model function to be applied to the voxel data.
    """
    # Implement model function logic here
    pass
```

**5. `requirements.txt`**

This file will contain the required dependencies for our system.

```
nibabel
pandas
```

Please note that the code provided is a skeleton implementation and may require further development and customization based on your specific requirements and the model functions you intend to use.

Make sure to double-check that all parts of the architecture are present in the files and that the code is fully functional.
