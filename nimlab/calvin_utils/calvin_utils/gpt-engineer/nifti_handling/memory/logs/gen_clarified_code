The row for each column contains path to the 4D niftis. 2) model_func will bee expanded upon later, but it should access a model which is defined in python and fit that model to the data at hand. Each model will fit to a given 'voxel' across every patient. So for voxel 1, each voxel 1 across all inputs will be modelled upon the clinical outcome provided. 3) UThe data should essentially be flattned such that each patient is in a column and then each row represents a voxel. Thus a 'dataframe' or numpy array will be created for each 4D nifti file provided. 4) Using python. Make sure to appropriately use GIL to prevent read/write conflicts. 5) Use your discretion. 6) In Python, the nibabel library, which is commonly used to load NIfTI files, supports memory-mapped I/O.
