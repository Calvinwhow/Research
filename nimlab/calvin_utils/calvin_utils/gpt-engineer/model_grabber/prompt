Write a python function which will be called to grab a python function to perform modelling. These models may range from linear regression to mediation analyses.
Function docstring must be printed. 
Function inputs/arguments must be collected from the given function. 
User input must be collected to provide function inputs. 
Output a print statement demonstrating how the given function will work. use this function:

def basic_trivariate_regression(x, y, z, dataframe):
    import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
    import pandas as pd
    
    formula = f'{z} ~ {x} + {y}'
    model = smf.ols(formula, data=dataframe)
    results = model.fit()
    return results
