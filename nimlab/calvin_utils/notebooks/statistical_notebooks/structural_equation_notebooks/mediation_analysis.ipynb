    "Mediation and moderation are two distinct concepts in statistics that help in understanding the relationships among three or more variables. Mediation deals with explaining the underlying process through which an independent variable (X) influences a dependent variable (Y). Moderation, on the other hand, addresses how the relationship between X and Y changes based on the level of a third variable, known as the moderator (W).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mediation Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In mediation analysis, we are interested in whether the relationship between X and Y is explained (or mediated) through another variable, called the mediator (M).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path a**: The independent variable (X) affects the mediator (M). This is the \"a\" path.\n",
    "- **Path b**: The mediator (M) affects the dependent variable (Y). This is the \"b\" path.\n",
    "- **Path c'**: There might also be a direct effect of X on Y that doesn't go through the mediator. This is the \"c'\" path or direct effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X ---(a)---> M ---(b)---> Y\n",
    " \\                        /\n",
    "  ---------(c')----------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The indirect effect is a*b, which is the portion of the effect of X on Y that is transmitted through the mediator M. The total effect of X on Y is the sum of the indirect effect and the direct effect (c').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderated Mediation Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderated mediation incorporates the idea that the mediation process itself can be contingent upon the levels of another variable (W), known as the moderator. In other words, the indirect effect of X on Y through M may change depending on the level of W.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X ---(a)---> M ---(b)---> Y\n",
    "|            | \n",
    "|------(W)---|\n",
    " \\                        /\n",
    "  ---------(c')----------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting the Results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the results of a moderated mediation analysis, you'll encounter several terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACME (control/treated): Average Causal Mediation Effects. This represents the average effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable through the mediator.\n",
    "- ADE (control/treated): Average Direct Effects. This represents the average direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable not through the mediator.\n",
    "- Total effect: Sum of ACME and ADE, representing the total effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "- Prop. mediated (control/treated): Proportion of the total effect that is mediated by the mediator.\n",
    "- The 'control' and 'treated' distinction in ACME and ADE accounts for possible treatment or intervention that could affect the mediation. If there's no treatment/intervention involved, they will be the same.\n",
    "- Lower CI bound and Upper CI bound represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimates.\n",
    "- P-value: Indicates the statistical significance of the estimates. A lower p-value (<0.05) typically indicates a statistically significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control: baseline regression without effect of the mediator\n",
    "- Treatment: mediated regression wherein the mediator is accounted for\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying Partial Mediations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In partial mediation, the mediator explains some, but not all, of the relationship between the independent variable (exposure) and the dependent variable (outcome). Here's how you can identify partial mediation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant Direct Effect (ADE): In partial mediation, the direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable remains significant even after accounting for the mediator. This means that there is still a direct path from the independent variable to the dependent variable that is not explained by the mediator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant Indirect Effect (ACME): The indirect effect through the mediator must also be significant. This means that the mediator is explaining part of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Effect > Direct Effect: The total effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable (before the mediator is added to the model) is generally greater than the direct effect (after accounting for the mediator). This shows that the mediator is explaining some portion of the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the results you usually get from mediation analysis, check for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "ADE (average direct effect) should be significant.\n",
    "ACME (average causal mediation effect) should be significant.\n",
    "The total effect should be greater than the direct effect, indicating that some portion of the effect is being accounted for by the mediator.\n",
    "In summary, partial mediation is present when both the direct and indirect paths are significant, but the inclusion of the mediator in the model reduces the direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable (without rendering it non-significant).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying a Mediated Exposure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exposure was being mediated, you would expect to see:\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant ACME (Average Causal Mediation Effect) - This indicates that the mediator is having a significant effect in the relationship between the exposure and the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant proportion mediated - This tells you the proportion of the total effect that is mediated. If this is significant, it implies that a noteworthy part of the relationship between the exposure and the outcome is occurring through the mediator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, keep in mind that the proportion mediated can be positive or negative, and this would indicate whether the mediator is increasing or decreasing the effect of the exposure on the outcome."

    "This is not a proper 'multivariate mediation analysis'.\n",
    "It does something slightly different: it performs individual mediation analyses for each mediator, while controlling for the exposure. This is different from assessing the conglomerate mediation effect of all mediators acting in unison.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate whether the effect of an independent variable on an outcome variable is fully mediated through multiple variables (e.g., atrophy in different brain regions), you would want to conduct a multiple mediator analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multiple mediator analysis, you examine the indirect effects of an independent variable (in this case, age) on a dependent variable through several mediators simultaneously. This allows you to estimate the portion of the effect of the independent variable that is transmitted through each mediator and whether, when taken together, these mediators account for the entirety of the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your case, the different atrophy regions will serve as multiple mediators. Here’s how this might look diagrammatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " Age ---(a1)---> Atrophy Region 1 ---(b1)---> Outcome\n",
    "  |           |\n",

    "   -------------------(c')-------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each atrophy region (1 through n) is a mediator. The indirect effect of age on the outcome through each atrophy region is a_i * b_i, and the total indirect effect is the sum of all these individual indirect effects. If this total indirect effect is significant and accounts for most of the effect of age on the outcome, and the direct effect (c') is non-significant, it indicates full mediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform multiple mediator analysis using the same statistical tools you use for single mediator analysis, but you will need to include multiple mediators in your model. This can be done using statistical software such as R, SAS, or Python's statsmodels. I have implemented this below using statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the mediation model is constructed in conceptual terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit a model for each mediator (Atrophy Region 1, Atrophy Region 2, ..., Atrophy Region n) as a function of the independent variable, Age.\n",
    "2. Fit a model for the outcome as a function of Age and all atrophy regions.\n",
    "3. Estimate the indirect effect of Age on the outcome through each atrophy region and sum them to get the total indirect effect.\n",
    "4. Compare the total indirect effect to the total effect of Age on the outcome to determine the proportion mediated.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing this analysis, you can ascertain whether the combined atrophy in different regions fully mediates the effect of age on the outcome variable. If you also have a moderation effect to consider (such as subiculum connectivity), this would be a moderated multiple mediation analysis. In this case, the indirect effects and the direct effect may change at different levels of the moderator.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have generated code which will run mutliple mediation analyses independently, but will therefor not be able to tell you how they sum to contribute to the proportion of the independent variable mediated by them. this is perform_individual_multiple_mediator_analysis. Python does not have a combined multiple mediator analysis supported, so I have developed one. It is perform_combined_multiple_mediator_analysis. Please use with caution. "

This analysis helps in understanding how different mediators may carry the influence of an independent variable to a dependent variable.\n",

    "**Technical Explanation**\n",
    "The perform_multiple_mediation_analysis function is designed to perform a multiple mediation analysis to estimate the joint indirect effects of an exposure variable through multiple mediators on a dependent variable. This is achieved through the use of bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a statistical technique where resampling of the dataset is done with replacement to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. In the case of multiple mediation analysis, it's used to estimate the joint indirect effects of mediators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function, for each bootstrap sample, the dataset is resampled with replacement. For each mediator, a simple linear regression is performed to estimate the path from the exposure variable to the mediator, denoted as 'a' paths. The product of these 'a' paths is computed, as this represents the joint effect of the exposure on all the mediators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a multiple regression is performed with the dependent variable as the response, and the mediators and exposure as predictors. The coefficients for the mediators represent the effect of the mediators on the dependent variable, controlling for the exposure, denoted as 'b' paths. The sum of these 'b' paths is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indirect effect for the bootstrap sample is then calculated as the product of the 'a' paths and the 'b' path sum. This process is repeated for a specified number of bootstrap samples (default is 5000), and the mean indirect effect is calculated from these bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function prints the mean indirect effect and its 95% confidence interval, which is estimated using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap indirect effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides an approximate estimate of the joint indirect effect through multiple mediators and allows for the calculation of confidence intervals around this effect."

    "A mediated moderation analysis explores how the effect of an independent variable (exposure) on a dependent variable (outcome) is moderated by a third variable, and this moderation effect is mediated by a fourth variable. Essentially, it helps to understand how the interaction between an independent variable and a moderator influences a dependent variable through a mediator. In short: is the moderation (interaction effect) attributable to something else (mediator).\n",

    "Technical Explanation\n",
    "The perform_mediated_moderation_analysis function is designed to perform a mediated moderation analysis to estimate the joint indirect effects of an exposure variable through a mediator on a dependent variable, considering the moderating effect of another variable. This is achieved through the use of bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a statistical technique where resampling of the dataset is done with replacement to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. In the case of mediated moderation analysis, it's used to estimate the joint indirect effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function, for each bootstrap sample, the dataset is resampled with replacement. Then, a simple linear regression model is fitted to estimate the path from the moderator variable to the mediator, denoted as 'a' path. The interaction between exposure and mediator is estimated using a multiple linear regression model with the dependent variable as the response, and the exposure, mediator, moderator, interaction of exposure and mediator, and interaction of exposure and moderator as predictors. The product of the 'a' path and the interaction effect represent the indirect effect for this bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for a specified number of bootstrap samples (default is 5000), and the mean indirect effect is calculated from these bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function prints the mean indirect effect and its 95% confidence interval, which is estimated using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap indirect effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides an approximate estimate of the joint indirect effect through a mediator and allows for the calculation of confidence intervals around this effect."
