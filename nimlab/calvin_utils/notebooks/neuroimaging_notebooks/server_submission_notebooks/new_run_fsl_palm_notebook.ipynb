    "# Run FSL Palm\n",

    "### Authors: Calvin Howard, Alexander Cohen, Christopher Lin, William Drew.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Last updated: July 6, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this to run/test a statistical model (e.g., regression or T-tests) on lesion network maps (or lesions alone!) using PALM, potentially taking into account specific covariates of interest and/or nuisance regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- To best use this notebook, you should be familar with GLM design and Contrast Matrix design. See this webpage to get started:\n",
    "[FSL's GLM page](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/GLM)\n",
    "- This notebook is a combination of the old PALM Notebooks and Christopher's palm_analysis notebooks (does the same thing) and requires the NIMLAB Python 3 environment as a kernel. Directions are on the [NIMLAB software_env README.md](https://github.com/nimlab/software_env)\n",
    "- You will need a csv file that provides the paths to your fcMaps, usually created from the [Preprocessing](https://github.com/nimlab/templates/blob/master/py3_notebooks/1_Preprocessing_LesionQA_fcSurfBcbLqtGen_nimtrack.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "- Christopher wrote up a really nice description of how to modify code to set up your design matrix within the notebook here: [PALM-Analysis](https://github.com/nimlab/documentation/wiki/PALM-experimental-designs)\n",
    "- I would also recommend reviewing Fred's [slides](https://github.com/nimlab/documentation/blob/master/presentations/presentation_palm_multidataset_analyses_labmeeting_13.4.2020.pdf) from his May 2020 lab meeting For details regarding the difference between implementing a random effects and fixed effects analysis and use of exchangeability blocks"
