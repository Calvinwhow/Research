If `append` is `True`, the text will be appended to the file if it exists, otherwise a new file will be created.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files.\n\n**file_writer.py**\n```python\nimport os\n\nclass FileWriter:\n    @staticmethod\n    def write_to_file(filename: str, text: str, append: bool) -> None:\n        mode = 'a' if append else 'w'\n        with open(filename, mode) as file:\n            file.write(text)\n\n```\n\n**main.py**\n```python\nfrom file_writer import FileWriter\n\ndef main():\n    filename = 'hello.txt'\n    text = 'Hello, world!'\n    append = True\n\n    FileWriter.write_to_file(filename, text, append)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n**requirements.txt**\n```\ndataclasses\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we have two files:\n1. `file_writer.py`: Contains the `FileWriter` class with the `write_to_file` method responsible for writing the text to a file.\n2. `main.py`: The entrypoint file that imports the `FileWriter` class and calls the `write_to_file` method to write the \"hello world\" text to a file.\n\nThe `requirements.txt` file specifies the `dataclasses` package as a dependency.\n\nPlease note that the code provided is a basic implementation to fulfill the requirements.
