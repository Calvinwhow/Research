This function will take the name of a function as input, grab the function from a module, collect the function's inputs/arguments, collect user input for providing function inputs, and print a statement demonstrating how the function will work.\n\nHere are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:\n\n1. `model_grabber` function: This function will grab a specific python function for modeling, collect its inputs/arguments, collect user input for providing function inputs, and print a statement demonstrating how the function will work.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the implementation of the code.\n\n**model_grabber.py**\n```python\nimport importlib\n\ndef model_grabber(module_name, function_name):\n    try:\n        module = importlib.import_module(module_name)\n        function = getattr(module, function_name)\n    except (ImportError, AttributeError):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Function '{function_name}' does not exist in module '{module_name}'\")\n\n    docstring = function.__doc__\n    if not docstring:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Function '{function_name}' does not have a docstring\")\n\n    inputs = {}\n    for arg in function.__code__.co_varnames:\n        if arg != 'dataframe':\n            user_input = input(f\"Enter value for '{arg}': \")\n            inputs[arg] = user_input\n\n    formula = f\"{inputs['z']} ~ {inputs['x']} + {inputs['y']}\"\n    print(f\"Will perform '{function_name}' with formula: {formula}\")\n    print(docstring)\n\n    return function\n```\n\nNow, let's create an entrypoint file to demonstrate the usage of the `model_grabber` function.\n\n**main.py**\n```python\nfrom model_grabber import model_grabber\n\ndef main():\n    module_name = input(\"Enter module name: \")\n    function_name = input(\"Enter function name: \")\n\n    try:\n        function = model_grabber(module_name, function_name)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(str(e))\n        return\n\n    # Example usage of the grabbed function\n    dataframe = None  # Provide the actual dataframe\n    results = function(**inputs, dataframe=dataframe)\n    print(results)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis is the complete implementation of the code. The `model_grabber` function is responsible for grabbing the specified function, collecting inputs, and printing the necessary information. The `main` function in the `main.py` file serves as the entrypoint for the program, where the user can input the module name and function name to grab the desired function.\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation of the grabbed function (`basic_trivariate_regression` in this case) is not provided as it depends on the specific modeling requirements and the structure of the dataframe.\n\nTo run the program, execute the `main.py` file and follow the prompts to input the module name and function name. The program will then grab the function, collect the necessary inputs, and print the information about how the function will work.\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder `None` with the actual dataframe when using the grabbed function.\n\nAdditionally, don't forget to create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the required dependencies for the project.\n\n**requirements.txt**\n```\nstatsmodels\npandas\n```\n\nThis file lists the required dependencies for the project, which in this case are `statsmodels` and `pandas`."}]
