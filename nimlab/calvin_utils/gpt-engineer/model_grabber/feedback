This is now very incorrect. Update model_grabber to print all classes in models.py. Then ask for input specifying the class to use. There should be a method in the class allowing us to define the variables to be passed when an entry-point function called start_function() is called from the class. Once we have specified the class to use, model_grabber should grab the entry_point function and allow us to specify the strings to use as inputs later.
