    "In the above code, the function auc_sample_size takes as input the expected AUC (between 0.5 and 1), the delta value (minimum difference from 0.5 that is considered significant), and the desired power of the test. It calculates the required sample sizes for positive (n1) and negative (n2) instances to achieve the given power for the significance test. It's assumed that you have an equal number of positive and negative instances, which is common in many studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses Hanley and McNeil's formula for the standard error (SE) of the AUC to calculate the observed Z score (Z), which is the difference between the observed AUC and 0.5, divided by the standard error. It iteratively increases the sample sizes until the observed Z score is greater than the required Z score for the desired power. This ensures that the test has sufficient power to detect a difference from 0.5 of at least delta.\n",

    "    delta: float\n",
    "        The minimum difference from 0.5 (random guess) that is considered to be practically significant.\n",
    "        This determines the alternative hypothesis for the significance test. For example, if delta is 0.05,\n",
